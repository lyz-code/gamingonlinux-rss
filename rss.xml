      <title>OpenRCT2 the re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies have arrived for <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Although it's fully playable already, the developers of this FOSS project continue to improve it a lot. This is another project that helps to keep a real classic game alive on modern systems, while also continually improving various features to make it feel just that little bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16287382281657102302gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of the new additions in version 0.4.1 released on July 4th include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alpine Coaster track type.</li>
<li>Option to show ride vehicles as separate entries when selecting a ride to construct.</li>
<li>FLAC and OGG/vorbis as supported audio formats for ride music objects.</li>
<li>Add vehicles for the Hybrid Coaster, Single-Rail Roller Coaster and Classic Mini Roller Coaster.</li>
<li>More natural looking shorelines in map generator.</li>
<li>Parks can now be resized into rectangular shapes from the map and map generation windows.</li>
<li>Tree placement is more natural during map generation.</li>
<li>The maximum price for the park entry has been raised to £999.</li>
<li>Weather no longer resets when converting a save to scenario.</li>
<li>Music Style dropdown is now sorted by name.</li>
<li>Transparency can be enabled directly without needing see-through enabled first.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus around 37 bug fixes were noted to make the game much more stable overall.</p>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Forgotten World free update out for Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creature battling metroidvania Monster Sanctuary has an expansive new free update out with The Forgotten World which is the largest update to the game yet. Adding in a new area, skills, items, new game modes and much more.</p>
<p>About it: "Delve deep into the Metroidvania inspired world of Monster Sanctuary, explore the expansive lands and call upon your monsters to lend their aid in and out of combat! Use their unique skills to fly, ride and brute force your way through environmental puzzles and precise platforming! The world is yours to traverse as you see fit, are you ready to take on the Sanctuary?"</p>
<p>Instead of The Forgotten World being a DLC, they decided to release it free to avoid any separation of the online PvP mode (optional) between people who have it and don't. Seems like a sane idea and gives everyone a bigger and better game. They've also added a "tip jar" on the <a href="https://monster-sanctuary.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> for anyone to donate if they want to support the developer thanks to the free upgrade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2e_Vw-ru3U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4354343c787cb397a973a34423efbb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2e_Vw-ru3U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the full highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new area, larger than any other area of Monster Sanctuary. Forgotten World is meant to be explored in the late game - either before you step foot in the Abandoned Tower, or after you finished the main story. You can find the entrance in the lower area of Horizon Beach. You will need a certain late-game exploration ability to enter this area.</li>
<li>Ten new Monsters.</li>
<li>Nine of them can be found in the Forgotten World. One of the ten new Monsters is a new secret Champion in Blue Cave - which might help you enter the Forgotten World earlier.</li>
<li>New Monster type: Ancient.</li>
<li>Many of the new Monsters have this type. There are also some older Monsters that have gained this type.</li>
<li>Level cap raised to 42 from 40.</li>
<li>All skill trees in the game have gained some new skill nodes. In some cases, we made extensive changes to older Monsters' skill trees.</li>
<li>A lot of new weapons and accessories.</li>
<li>Two new player costumes.</li>
<li>Some new rooms and treasure chests have been added to older areas of the game as well.</li>
<li>Some new exploration abilities have been added to the game as well. Some of the exploration abilities of older Monsters have been updated.</li>
<li>On top of three new Champion fights, there is a new super-secret Champion fight that can only be found by Keeper Masters. It is the most difficult fight in the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to buy Monster Sanctuary you can do so on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/monster-sanctuary?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814370/Monster_Sanctuary/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>winesapOS is another way to get something like SteamOS on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has still yet to produce an official installable image of SteamOS 3 for desktops, as always the community provides and another worth looking into is <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS</a>. Another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/holoiso-brings-valves-steamos-3-from-the-steam-deck-to-everyone/" target="_blank">I covered is HoloISO</a>, which tries to stick quite closely to SteamOS 3 but winesapOS aims to be a bit more than that.</p>
<p>Originally called the "Mac Linux Gaming Stick", the aim was to give macOS users an easy bootable disk to run Linux to get expanded game compatibility but it rebranded a while ago to expand the scope for many more users.</p>
<p>From what one of the developers told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ultimate goal is not to provide the exact SteamOS experience that the Steam Deck provides like HoloISO does. We are focused on the desktop experience and expanding support for SteamOS by making the operating system work on a wide range of hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with that goal, they have expanded hardware support on desktops / laptops and of course Apple Mac systems too. They also have much more up to date software compared with SteamOS, it supports UEFI and legacy BIOS, encrypted filesystem support, has the Pamac application for installing / updating other software and comes pre-installed with plenty of software like Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, and PolyMC while still keeping the look and feel similar to SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>A big new release with version 3.1.0 went up recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux packages upgrades</li>
<li>Graphics driver upgrades with support for Intel, NVIDIA and virtual machines</li>
<li>Improved controller support</li>
<li>An improved upgrade procedure</li>
<li>A fork for the PlayStation 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Organ swapping FPS &#39;Wrought Flesh&#39; gets a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wrought Flesh is a game where you run around and pinch the organs of downed enemies to upgrade your body. It's pretty weird and a big content update is out now.</p>
<p>"Rip out enemies organs and equip them in your own body. Fight biopunk monsters and drugged-up space bandits. You are a Gajeshian Cultist: A near-mythological being built from the bodies of long-dead saints. You have arrived on the partially terraformed planet of Chrisembourgh on a temple-ordained mission to find and kill someone. Explore the planet and trace your victims steps to the end."</p>
<p>The 'Purple Sands of Cumulun' update adds in a reworked oasis area, tons of new quests, new guns, new music, a new monster, reworked AI, new achievements and they had "an actual writer" rework the text too. Seems like a lot of work went into this update.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together big Curse of Moon Quay update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Curse of Moon Quay is the latest major update for the Native Linux survival game Don't Starve Together and it sounds like a great one. They also updated it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/klei-fixes-up-dont-starve-together-for-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Steam Deck support</a> recently too!</p>
<p>Easily one of the best survival games you can play on a Linux desktop or Steam Deck, as it's just such a fun game and the style of it is simply magnificent. One of the greatest games Klei has made for sure, but then I like pretty much anything Klei make.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eligdVVedDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/813cba69f1fea5e25f29441b43ffe0c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eligdVVedDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features includes:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_ExpandSectionBody_2sCNL">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Moon Quay Island and inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ocean Privateers.</li>
<li>New upgrades for boating:
	<ul>
<li>Grass Boat</li>
<li>Kelp Bumper</li>
<li>Shell Bumper</li>
<li>Cannon and Cannonballs</li>
<li>Rudder</li>
<li>Trawler</li>
<li>Polly Roger's Hat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docks</li>
<li>Nautopilot and Nautopilot Beacon</li>
<li>New perspectives on life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new content, they also tweaked some existing features like making map controls and zooming much more intuitive and just make more sense. Zooming for example now focuses on the cursor for the map and will be smoother, rotating the map will also be done around the current location and not the player and controllers will see a better directional panning experience.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> where it's 66% off for the 2022 Summer Sale. Absolutely worth getting.</p>

      <title>Quirky murder mystery adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates releases July 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lord Winklebottom Investigates is an upcoming adventure from UK-based developer Cave Monsters, and they've recently confirmed it will release on July 28th. This game will be coming along with full Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from British literature icons such as Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, Lord Winklebottom and his tea-drinking hippo companion Dr. Frumple will enjoy a journey full of intrigue and secrets that will apparently keep mystery fans gripped. The developer said it's a game with plenty of heart, featuring a script and setting full of bizarre characters and humour that wouldn’t be out of place in a Monty Python or Blackadder sketch.</p>

<p>Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign it's set in the 1920s where the world’s foremost detective is about to embark on his most challenging case yet. Set on an isolated island where there's a grisly murder, it's a race against time to track down the killer.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full English voice acting.</li>
<li>An original 1920s inspired soundtrack featuring live instruments.</li>
<li>Play as a gentleman giraffe!</li>
<li>Unique 2D hand painted artwork.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes!</li>
<li>Streamlined point and click interface.</li>
<li>Collection of bizarre characters to interrogate!</li>
<li>Dozens of puzzles to solve!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Feartress is a new incremental city-building RPG in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feartress is a bit of a quirky one. Blending together elements of an idle RPG with some small city-building that sees you go through different dimensions. I'm really not sure on the best way to describe this one, it's just odd but it has a pretty nice idea to play through.</p>
<p>"A new take on the genre of incremental games where you go on a journey to collect all the 21 elemental pearls and restore balance to the universe. You build up a settlement in each world and destroy enemy structures to find loot and unlock new perks. Collect epic and legendary gear to help you venture into new worlds with increasingly powerful enemies."</p>

      <title>Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A second bundle (yes there's two) supporting people in the USA following the overturning of Roe v. Wade is live on itch.io with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1471/worthy-of-better-stronger-together-for-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle</a>. The other is the Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/itchio-are-hosting-a-big-indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 24th, 2022 was a harrowing day for civil liberties. In the United States, basic human rights are being stripped away. It is a stark reminder that even after 50 years of legal protection, equality can be so easily lost. To say nothing of the dangerous precedent this decision sets for other civil rights protections, we believe that the right for a person to pursue safe and legal abortions is more than enough reason to stand up and take action. This decision does not only effect those capable of becoming pregnant. It is a determination of what rights we as a society choose to hold sacred. It is a question of  who is deemed worthy of protecting. The fabric of our society is woven by every single member, to erode a single thread unravels us all. We must all take a stand and demand that our rights and bodily autonomy are federally recognized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a charity bundle as well with all proceeds being split between these two charities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://now.org/" target="_blank">National Organization for Women</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Center for Reproductive Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can pay $10 (or more) to support it and gain access to 169 different items spread across games, tools and more including some gems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Away Team</li>
<li>Aground</li>
<li>Not Actually A DOS Game</li>
<li>Sally Face</li>
</ul>
<p>The bundle is up for the next 11 days.</p>

      <title>Desktopia is a city-builder that runs along the bottom of your desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Desktopia: A Desktop Village Simulator seems like quite a unique idea for a city-builder, also a fun distraction to have open on your desktop. Instead of giving you a big full-screen window, the game sits along the bottom of your screen allowing you to carry on with whatever you're doing while also keeping an eye on your little people.</p>
<p>"Like any city-builder, you get to make the big decisions, while also being able to take control of your own sword wielding character. You can join in the battles, harvest resources, put out fires, or interact with your villagers. In Desktopia, you can be as active, or as idle, as you want!"</p>
<p>You can see the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cGCWSWy4Jnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6b5806ae2efc9f04fc8548642c6cf9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cGCWSWy4Jnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, as a basic demo of how it would work on your actual desktop, they have a video on that too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uw7sz1pA9Ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/460346435f22a746d343f4fd4924c8c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uw7sz1pA9Ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely original approach in PC gaming: designed with functionality in mind, Desktopia allows you to use your PC for multiple purposes on a single monitor.</li>
<li>Clever UI: with resizeable pop-out windows which can be arranged anywhere on your screen.</li>
<li>A playable character which levels with your village, so you can jump into the action whenever you want.</li>
<li>Detailed logs and statistics arrayed in beautiful charts and graphs.</li>
<li>Spy Mode: focus the camera on any villager, any time, and watch as they live their life.</li>
<li>Resizeable game world, with the option to have it 'always on top' of other windows.</li>
<li>From nothing: grow a series of villages along a dangerous and treacherous road: from a single house to a bustling metropolis.</li>
<li>Construct a range of facilities (inns, libraries, post offices, temples, blacksmiths etc) and watch villagers move in independently.</li>
<li>Keep your villagers happy to collect gratitude, and use it to host festivals which bedeck your village in bunting!</li>
<li>Recruit and upgrade soldiers to defend your village from undead, bandits, fairies, and demons. Join them in battle if that's your thing!</li>
<li>Hire heroes to lead the charge against your foes and destroy their strongholds.</li>
<li>Decide on building low-tech villages with few needs, or risk it big by aiming for high-tech villages with needy villagers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Denuvo announced Denuvo SecureDLC to protect DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Denuvo is not exactly something any gamer I've ever seen be happy about and now it's growing and will likely appear in more games, with the announcement of Denuvo SecureDLC.</p>
<p>Irdeto said in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2471835/0/en/Denuvo-by-Irdeto-launches-Denuvo-SecureDLC-the-industry-s-first-solution-to-protect-downloadable-content-against-piracy.html" target="_blank">press release</a> it's "the first of its kind in the gaming market and provides opportunities to extend the revenue tail for developers and publishers past the initial launch window".</p>
<p>The main target here appears to be free to play games that offer up DLC and micro-transactions to unlock various features, cosmetics and so on with SecureDLC being positioned to protect against piracy there. So Irdeto are hoping that developers will pick SecureDLC to deal with it apparently becoming "easy to bypass the existing barriers that try to secure DLCs on popular gaming platforms like Steam and Epic" as they found "players can automatically generate and install programs that access downloadable content without paying for it".</p>
<p>According to Reinhard Blaukovitsch, Managing Director at Denuvo by Irdeto, the new technology is already being successfully used with the current Denuvo Anti-Tamper clients: “Denuvo has become a one-stop shop for game developers to ensure the safety of their game against cheating, tampering, and piracy and to protect the gaming experience. Our current clients, big and small, are ecstatic with the results and we are happy to help them maximize revenue and also enable new business models for these games they spent so much effort building.”</p>

      <title>Play as a sarcastic cow in the comedy adventure A Trail of Ooze </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Trail of Ooze is an upcoming comedy adventure where you take on the role of a sarcastic cow who attempts to find their missing human farmer. It honestly sounds quite hilarious and the story sounds like something that I feel I need to play through.</p>
<p>"Majros, the cow, lives on a small farm in the middle of the Swedish forests oblivious to the struggles of the outside world - until genetically engineered chemicals spread across the farm. All animals and plants mutate and gain human-like consciousness and the farmer, who witnessed it all, is kidnapped by agents from the evil agrochemical corporation. So, Majros sets out on a rescue mission following a trail of the chemical ooze. On her adventure she unravels conspiracies, battles social injustices and comes face to face with environmental disaster. Forced to leave her safe bubble, Majros learns that no cow or story is only black and white and that she cannot make it alone against the insidious corporation."</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the USA that threatens to remove access to abortions a bunch of indie developers have pulled together to make an <a href="https://itch.io/b/1472/indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds" target="_blank">Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</a> on itch.io.</p>
<p>Much like itch.io did with previous charity bundles like for Racial Justice and Equality, Palestinian Aid, Ukraine Relief and others all the funds will be going to select charities and you can donate while also grabbing a big bunch of games, game assets, physical games to print and much more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100% of the proceeds from this bundle will go to the National Network for Abortion Fund's <a href="http://nnaf.org/collectivepowerfund" target="_blank">Collective Power Fund</a>, which moves money <em><strong>directly</strong></em> to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included is pretty great too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haque</li>
<li>Pushamo</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw</li>
<li>Bleed</li>
<li>Bleed 2</li>
<li>Buck Up and Drive!</li>
<li>Calico</li>
<li>…and the list goes on</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a minimum payment of $10 but you can donate more and they will be adding more items to the bundle up to July 6th. The bundle runs for another 9 days.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 515.57 and Vulkan Beta 515.49.06 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiple driver updates have been released by NVIDIA for Linux recently so here's a look at what's new in each.</p>
<p>First up, for those of you sticking with the "Latest Production Branch" <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank">version 515.57</a> went up on June 28th which is mainly just fixing up some issues and getting them working nicely. Here's what's new:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some graphics applications to crash when they are started while nvidia-drm.ko is not loaded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC could return an incorrect frame if a capture request timed out.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC direct capture would wait for multiple queued frames to finish rendering, instead of returning the next rendered frame.</li>
<li>Added support for NvFBC direct capture to composite the mouse cursor onto frames.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Vulkan direct to display could not drive more than 4 displays from a single VkInstance.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from accurately reflecting changes to some configuration properties.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, we missed covering that NVIDIA also updated the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> during June. Version 515.49.05 on June 17th added support for the new open source kernel modules (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">more on that here</a>) plus these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</a> [Linux]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fix the depth and stencil clear color for dynamic rendering</li>
<li>Fix possible corruption when the shading rate image is changed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 2nd version 515.49.06 also went up with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with image copy when one of the formats is a single-plane interleaved video format</li>
<li>Fixed issue with vkCmdResetEvent on compute queues</li>
<li>Fixed regression with tessellation mode set be the tessellation control shader</li>
<li>Fixed issue with underestimate conservative rasterization sometimes not working correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want a stable experience, just stick with the mainline drivers as the Vulkan Beta is aimed at developers who need to test out the latest Vulkan extensions.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.12 is out now for improving Windows compatibility on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another two weeks have gone by so the Wine hackers have put out their latest development work with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.12" target="_blank">Wine 7.12</a> now available.</p>
<p>This is the Windows compatibility layer that allows you to run various applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Wine 7.12 highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Theming support for Qt5 applications.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.4.</li>
<li>Improved effect support in Direct2D.</li>
<li>QWORD support in registry tools.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the bug fixes for this release include issues solved for Star Citizen, Shogun Total War 2, Argentum 20, Wireshark and others.</p>
<p>Recently they also had the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/news/2022062201" target="_blank">vkd3d 1.4</a> release of their Direct3D to Vulkan translation library (not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton) which included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many improvements to the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>A new descriptor heap implementation using the VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing extension.</li>
<li>A new fence implementation using the VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux share on Steam hits highest peak in years thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for June 2022, putting the Linux user share at one of its highest ever points and likely thanks to the rise of the Steam Deck and SteamOS. As shown on our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, it's been trending upwards for quite a while but this latest figure is a pretty good showing.</p>
<p>As of June 2022, Linux is sitting at <u><strong>1.18%</strong></u> of the Steam user share.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, that doesn't sound like a lot on paper, but it puts the monthly active Linux user count at around 1,557,600 at least (based on when Valve last gave the monthly active user count).</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of the most popular Linux systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 11.42% -1.43%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 10.11% -0.98%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 9.90% +1.86%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 9.73% -2.02%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 7.58% +2.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 6.45% +0.48%</li>
<li>Description:Freedesktop.org 21.08.14 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.05% +6.05%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.79% +4.79%</li>
<li>Other 33.96% -11.11%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can pretty plainly see that the Steam Deck with SteamOS is already rising up the ranks, as one of the most popular Linux gaming systems on Steam's survey with it already making up well over 7% of Linux players which is a nice increase from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/steam-deck-already-hits-over-5-of-linux-users-on-steam/" target="_blank">5% from May 2022</a>.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the NecroDancer gets a BIG surprise update with more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer from Brace Yourself Games is a truly wonderful mix of dungeon crawling and a rhythm game that released back in 2015. It just got a huge surprise update and more is on the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer is an award winning hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Move on the beat to navigate an ever changing dungeon while battling dancing skeletons, zombies, dragons, and more. Groove to the epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A no beat mode, to make it easier for some players.</li>
<li>Save and Quit anytime.</li>
<li>Reduced loading time.</li>
<li>Improved controller support via Steam Input, with gamepad-specific button symbols and Steam Deck support.</li>
<li>An overhauled custom music system supporting MP3, OGG and FLAC formats.</li>
<li>Linux gets a Native file-picker for custom music.</li>
<li>New and Improved Co-op.</li>
<li>A new level editor.</li>
<li>Added a fully redesigned mod loader and modding menus.</li>
<li>And loads more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that this is only the start, I'm very curious to see what they have cooking up as they said " this is a precursor to something bigger coming your way, and we want to make sure that we address some of the community’s most significant feedback before we get there".</p>
<p>Since I love the game (although I am horrible at it), I wanted to see how it was on the Steam Deck now so here's a little attempt at it today:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XsnzdN0J6Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d0247f465b2c68af9d257e4be86b093.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XsnzdN0J6Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Don't judge me, I'm rubbish but it's such a gem.</em></p>
<p>There does seem to be a bug with the Steam Input configuration though. I had to pick a different profile, then back to the new official one for it to actually detect input. Apart from that it seems great on Deck.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crypt-of-the-necrodancer?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG finally remove the false &#34;in progress&#34; note about GOG Galaxy for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems at some point over the last month or two, GOG finally removed the "in progress" notice for GOG Galaxy coming to Linux.</p>
<p>Something that was a bit <em>overdue</em>, since they clearly have no plans to actually bring GOG Galaxy to Linux despite it being the <a href="https://www.gog.com/wishlist/galaxy" target="_blank">most voted-for</a> feature request for many years. GOG and CD Projekt never really took it seriously though, with even the official Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1012760227148587009" target="_blank">trolling</a> "We can assure you: it‘s not us. We are the driving force behind 'add Linux support for GOG Galaxy' though" in reply to GOG post about showing 2077 gameplay.</p>
<p>Every time I've spoken to the GOG team over the last few years, they just repeatedly told me it wasn't planned, despite the wishlist entry still listing it as "in progress" and their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2014/06/gogcom-announce-galaxy-their-optional-client-linux-support-to-come/" target="_blank">original announcement</a> mentioning it would come to Linux too and that it was "being done with PC, Mac and Linux in mind" (so much for that huh?).</p>
<p>At least there's applications like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> that can help you manage your GOG games on Linux. Still, it would be nice if GOG at some point put some more resources into improving their Linux support. Plus, if you're going to be using a Steam Deck, buying from Steam just makes a lot more sense when it's far easier to access so I imagine that's eventually going to cost GOG a few more sales too and they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">not exactly doing well</a>.</p>
<p>It is a shame for those that want the Galaxy client, as I actually love what GOG do. The main idea that you can just log in and download a full offline installer is great and their repeated revivals of old games is wonderful too. But without Galaxy, some games end up missing features for Linux or just skipping a Linux build entirely on GOG.</p>

      <title>AK-xolotl mixes the incredibly cute with the deadly in this rogue-lite shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AK-xolotl is an upcoming rogue-lite that answers the question of: what happens if you gave an axolotl an AK? Someone must have asked that somewhere.</p>
<p>Currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter with a few days left, it appears to be rather popular and it was initially funded in only 4 hours. The developer is planning full Native Linux support too so I've no idea how I missed this one originally because the idea is nuts and it looks gorgeous too. Mixing together procedurally generated biomes with handcrafted layouts, it seems like it will have a lot of replay value too. You also get to unlock various powers and the game evolves as you progress through it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oPOn8iu354o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/976c9443785829468ccd8fac47ebafa4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oPOn8iu354o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cutest and deadliest roguelite action:</strong> with lots of hours of gameplay and great replayability value!</li>
<li><strong>The ultimate pond inspired experience:</strong> beautiful pixel art graphics filled with pond-like details, rich colors and a variety of sceneries.</li>
<li><strong>Hunt and obliterate your prey with tons of different weapons:</strong> melee, close-range, long-range, etc., you pick your own playstyle!</li>
<li><strong>Multiple power-ups to beef up your Axolotl:</strong> yes, you have guns, but why not some extra powers as well, that not only make you mightier but add variety to the gameplay?!</li>
<li><strong>Tons of different types of enemies:</strong> Axolotl's meal will be buffet style!</li>
<li><strong>Expandable and customizable hub:</strong> build and customize your own pond and craft new items to decorate it! Your axolotl deserves the best place to live in.</li>
<li><strong>You are not just an apex predator, but also a Michelin chef: </strong>cook delicious recipes with all the ingredients you gather throughout your hunting adventures and become stronger!</li>
<li><strong>Cute baby axolotls that become playable:</strong> pet and care for baby axolotls. Feed them, nurture them and watch them grow! Finally, bring them on your hunting adventures.</li>
<li><strong>Fully supported online leaderboards:</strong> because highscores only really matter if you can brag about it!</li>
<li><strong>3 extra game modes for some bite-sized action:</strong> King of the Pond, Horde and Chrono.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Core Keeper hits 1 million sales in only a few months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have announced that their game Core Keeper has managed to hit 1 million sales only a few months after entering Early Access. This follows on from the rather large Sunken Sea Update that released in the middle of June.</p>
<p>Nice to see another fully supported Native Linux indie game doing so well. Here's what they said about the impressive milestone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re delighted to announce that, shortly after the launch of The Sunken Sea Update - our first major content update - Core Keeper hit 1,000,000 sales. This is a momentous occasion for us as developers and for our publisher, Fireshine Games. In fact, Core Keeper previously set the record for being Fireshine Games’ fastest-selling digital game of all time by selling 100,000 copies within its first two days of Early-Access launch.<br/>

We’re truly overwhelmed by the fantastic community response that Core Keeper has had, and we’re thrilled to have hit this milestone so early on in the games’ development. Launching in Early Access has given us a unique opportunity to involve the community in major game decisions and collaborate with them on improvements and optimisations.</p>

<p>Remember all that talk about the indiepocalypse? We seem to be hearing more and more about games doing so well, and a lot of them come from smaller teams like this too. Just like Valheim managed to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valheim-is-absolutely-smashing-it-with-10-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank">sell over 10 million copies</a>, it just goes to show that some good marketing and an actually good game will clearly sell.</p>

      <title>Free and open source arena shooter Xonotic 0.8.5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some fast-paced first-person shooting action? Xonotic (a fork of the original Nexuiz) has a brand new release available with tons of improvements.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big release for the project touching on nearly every part of the gameplay, with some big tech changes behind the scenes too. Thousands of changes for better and more refined gameplay, new and updated maps and player models, new sound effects, much more dangerous bots, a new HUD, more translations and so much more.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't play online, the changes to bots will be most welcome. Not only have they tweaked their difficulty but various bug fixes came in like underwater navigation, they will no longer get stuck in bad spots, they can properly jump and crouch, they have an improved ability to avoid danger while running and bunny hopping and they're better at chasing enemies down too.</p>
<p>It should be a bit easier to pick out players / bots from the maps to actually shoot them too thanks to improved visibility, plus new and improved primary shirt and secondary glow colouring on some models and they fixed primary and secondary colours getting mixed up.</p>
<p>Two new maps made it in too with Bromine by <em>packer</em>, a rusty styled map for large games!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Opium by <em>cityy</em>, a medium sized level with plenty of vertical action!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Various other maps saw updates, there's refreshed weapon and item sound effects to help you better distinguish them during combat and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A massive release overall and you can see all the changes in the <a href="https://xonotic.org/posts/2022/xonotic-0-8-5-release/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big updates have rolled out for the Steam Deck which includes an opt-in Beta SteamOS 3.3 upgrade, plus there's also a Steam Deck Beta Client update.</p>
<p>First up, the Beta <u><strong>Client</strong></u> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3323108691056012032" target="_blank">update</a> brings in these fixes:</p>

<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added missing Deck buttons for Gyro Enable and Button Chord options</li>
<li>Added support for game-bundled Virtual Menu icons in the in-game Deck UI</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Simplified Chinese (Pinyin), Traditional Chinese (Pinyin, Zhuyin, and Cangjie), Japanese, and Korean keyboards. We are still refining these keyboards, please provide feedback in the forums.</li>
<li>Re-enabled the Adaptive Backlight feature.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for SteamOS 3.3 Beta itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3410929607716145819/" target="_blank">here's all</a> that was added:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Fixed audio out on some capture cards</li>
<li>Fixed some instances of corrupt audio after resuming from sleep</li>
<li>Fixed audio output with some 32-bit games that use ALSA</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like Valve have been hard at work to improve much of the experience overall on the Steam Deck, this makes me very happy since I boot mine up every day without fail, it really is my main gaming machine now outside of times where it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>In other Steam deck news, here's a few recent big bits you might have missed:</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat work on Warhammer: Vermintide 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux &#39;on hold&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's supposed to be relatively easy for games with anti-cheat like BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get working on Linux and Steam Deck, some developers are having issues like Fatshark with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>.</p>
<p>This particular game uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is supposed to be a case of ticking a few boxes and making sure things are in the right place to allow EAC to work with Steam Play Proton but it turns out it might not be that simple for every game. A shame, but not a big surprise, as if it was truly that simple for every game more would have done it by now, and considering how big game projects and code are, there's likely plenty of smaller gotchas developers need to deal with.</p>
<p>A rep from Fatshark posted on the Steam forum to give an update on the work to get Warhammer: Vermintide 2 playable and it's not good news. Despite chatting to Epic and Valve, they couldn't figure it out and now their team is working on the upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=26#c3419936604888208895" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we have performed all the requisite steps to have this work. We've ticked the boxes in the EAC portal, included the files in the appropriate places. Problem is, as you can see, it doesn't work in this scenario. We've been in touch with both third parties (in this case Epic and Valve), but we're at a bit of a roadblock truth be told. Those who would work on really digging in to the weeds on this are indeed digging in to Darktide weeds, so aren't able to spend sufficient time liaising with Valve and Epic to figure out what's causing the 'simple steps' to not be as simple as they sounded.<br/>
<br/>
In short, work on this is on hold for now. We'll bark up this thread should things spin up again.</p>

      <title>Strategy-survival game Dice Tribes: Ambitions gets a Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice Tribes: Ambitions is a pretty interesting looking strategy survival game mix, where you move dice around to keep your tribe and village going. It might not sound or even look like much but it seems like it might surprise you with the mechanics involved.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly well-known game and so far it only has around 23 Steam user reviews, but they are 100% positive. If you're after something different, perhaps this is one to give a go? The developer also just recently updated the game to provide a Native Linux build too. The developer describes it as a "dice worker placement game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VZHV0iOyxHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46012b5a36967e70483f21db02319ce0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VZHV0iOyxHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with a small number of villagers, you will need to manage them and grow the tribes in order to complete one of the ambitions. Opportunities and Dangers lies ahead and you will need to dispatch your villagers to take care of them. Prepare your villagers as you attempt to complete one of the ambition to win the game.</p>
<p>Key Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose from one of 6 tribes, each with their own village building.</li>
<li>Choose from more than 15 different structures and construct them to aid in your Ambition.</li>
<li>Choose from one of many ambitions to complete, including hidden ones.</li>
<li>Draft mode that forces you to adapt to different restrictions and challenges.</li>
</ul>

      <title>73 of the top 100 most popular Steam games are playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little while since checking how well the top 100 most played games on Steam work on Linux and the Steam Deck, so here's a fresh run over the list for you.</p>
<p>For those who just want the official numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>28 - Verified</li>
<li>45 - Playable</li>
<li>22 - Unsupported</li>
<li>5 - Unchecked</li>
</ul>
<p>So officially <u>73</u> of the top 100 will work on the Steam Deck currently. Any game that is playable on Steam Deck will be playable on Linux desktops too (minus perhaps some very rare exceptions). However, if you take into account ratings also from <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and some personal testing, the number will be likely a little higher especially for those Valve has not yet tested.</p>
<p>Here's the full list below, which is a snapshot taken today (June 30th, 2022). Since it's based on player-counts it fluctuates but not massively so, and it's more the bottom few that move in and out the rest just switch positions.</p>

<p>As pretty much expected, the biggest culprit of what's not playable is issues with Anti-Cheat. Despite Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye supporting Linux and the Steam Deck, there's still a lot of issues there with developers either not updating or having trouble with the integration so it's an uphill struggle there.</p>
<p>For games that are listed as Playable some of the biggest issues there are a mixture of things like: launchers being a nuisance, on-screen keyboard needing to be pulled up manually, no gamepad support and text that's too small. For developers, it often doesn't take much to bump up from Playable to Verified and lots of them have been putting in the effort, which you can see across many articles in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">the Steam Deck tag</a>.</p>
<p>Some games tagged as Unsupported may also appear to work fine, but there's a few cases where they can end up very unstable later on (like Forza Horizon 4). So even if you might think an Unsupported title is wrong, it might not be.</p>

      <title>AOKZOE are the latest to attempt a Steam Deck rival with the AOKZOE A1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AOKZOE will be jumping in the handheld ring with their upcoming AOKZOE A1 AMD Ryzen 7 6800U portable that will offer either Windows 11 or SteamOS to perhaps rival the Steam Deck. They're a rather new company, so everything they're talking about and showing off should be taken with a rather large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>To go against the Steam Deck though they're not only going to have to be able to ship a lot of units, but actually have a price-point that isn't ridiculous like some other vendors. Considering Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">ramping up shipments now</a>, how is a brand new vendor going to cope?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAeZ8ABXx8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d58a898743dbba90abc99a7ff8f58712.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAeZ8ABXx8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The specifications they list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A combo of AMD Ryzen 7 6800U | Radeon 680M | LPDDR5X (Freq. 6400)</li>
<li>8-inch IPS Screen, sRGB 100％, 1920 x 1200</li>
<li>Windows 11 or Steam OS</li>
<li>RGB Breathing Lighting</li>
<li>PD Charge</li>
<li>Gyroscope</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zMMbfJ_JXos"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b5e819013ed03e12f0baa888934cdd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zMMbfJ_JXos" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said it will go up for pre-order in July and it's scheduled to start shipping in September.</p>
<p>I'm pretty skeptical of this, since they just popped up out of nowhere but perhaps worth keeping an eye on. Price is going to be the biggest question and currently they're not telling. Even so, if it was reasonably priced, trust is perhaps the second biggest question with such a new vendor.</p>

      <title>Some Steam Decks ship with an x2 SSD instead of an x4 SSD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve made a change to the specifications of the top two versions of the Steam Deck last month, which it seems plenty of people (including me) completely missed. It's not a massive change but still one to be aware of as not all Decks are the same.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is split across three models either with a 64 GB eMMC, 256 GB NVMe SSD or a 512 GB NVMe SSD (and the top model has the anti-glare etched screen too). Sometime around May 28th though, the SSDs shipping in the Steam Deck changed and now come in <em>two</em> possible editions and you won't know what you have until you get it and check.</p>
<p>On the specifications page, it now lists this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>64 GB eMMC (PCIe Gen 2 x1)</li>
<li>256 GB NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
<li>512 GB high-speed NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With Valve noting "*Some 256GB and 512GB models ship with a PCIe Gen 3 x2 SSD. In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4".</p>
<p><em>You can see the change thanks to the Wayback Machine on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220527060926/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 27th</a> and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220528095946/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 28th</a>.</em></p>
<p>Really, it shouldn't make all that much of a difference, especially considering the Micro SD slot can load and run even some of the highest-end games just fine. This is quite likely one of the ways Valve has been able to ramp up production to ship <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">more than double each week</a>, along with the two different fan models you might also see.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Return to Monkey Island, the continuation of the story from he Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge now has a first gameplay trailer. With a return of series creator Ron Gilbert and developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, it's certainly an exciting game to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Today, Devolver Digital released the first trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p3mxq44HhnU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8beb1ca0f98b70fcfed7ee8998cddbf2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p3mxq44HhnU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.<br/>
<br/>
Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't quite know what platforms it will be on yet as it's all "TBA" (to be announced).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pocket Wheels looks like a fun toy-car playground that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocket Wheels looks like what you could imagine in your mind when playing with toy cars as a child and it's on the way to Linux with Native support.</p>
<p>A mixture of a 3D platformer and a racing game, inspired by "90s collectathons". In the game you control a toy car that can jump, glide and there's even a grappling hook. The idea is to give you a big playground to race and fly through, just like you always dreamed of right? You get various vehicles to unlock too and there's a number of different rooms each with their own race tracks, objectives and collectibles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZFJocKALaQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b312d3d04043a78170792670e626c55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZFJocKALaQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This looks like pure joy. Reminds me a little of classic Micro Machines games!</p>
<p>Speaking on the Steam forum, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1129360/discussions/0/5755024051061146444/#c3419934814486215419" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that while it works with Proton already they are "working on a native Build for the future" and they're testing it on the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Onsen Master blends Overcooked with Spirited Away and releases soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending the frantic action from the Overcooked series with inspiration taken from Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away, the upcoming Linux Native game Onsen Master looks like fun.</p>
<p>Onsen Master features arcade-style single and two-player co-op, where players must manage the customers of their hot springs, and prepare and put together the correct ingredients to cure their ailments. Running around the hot springs, wrangling wandering customers, and putting the right concoctions into the right baths can be hectic enough already, but troublesome yokai look to impede players' service as well.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also sent out recently that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BhyerDH382k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2804f7d21f00dac49b9481ae1e558a0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BhyerDH382k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spring Fling:</strong> Experience a short and sweet story for up to two players, and unveil the island of Izajima in a visual novel style narrative with a cute anime aesthetic.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Customer is Always Right: </strong>Skip the story and dive right in with Arcade Mode! Choose one of the six hot spring levels to put your customer service skills to the test.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Heat is On: </strong>Take on others in a competitive couch multiplayer mode where players must each work to manage their customers within the same hot spring.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spa Music: </strong>An original soundtrack full of tunes akin to a Feudal fairytale, composed by Dorrell Ettienne.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">How did the idea come about? The concept for Onsen Master dates back to 2015, when Waking Oni Games founder Derrick Fields was inspired by their regular rewatches of Spirited Away, specifically a section of the film in which the protagonist is working with spirits at a bathhouse. This formed the basis of Onsen Master’s hot spring customer management gameplay, and also the Japanese setting and aesthetic of the game. After five years of development, a successful Kickstarter campaign and beta period, and the partnership with Whitethorn Games, Onsen Master is finally ready to release "this month" they said (although it's now the end of June and a date hasn't actually been given yet).</p>

      <title>Fech The Ferret is an upcoming vibrant parkour rhythm-platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your musical games and want to get into the rhythm? Fech The Ferret looks like a pretty clever blending of ideas.</p>
<p>It's a fast-paced parkour platformer with seriously vibrant and inviting colours. The hook here is that the faster you go, the better the music gets. A mixture of high speed 3D platforming and rhythmic subtones inside of a colorful open world. The developer emailed in about it, making it clear they fully support Linux with a Native build and there's also a demo available to try right now.</p>
<p>"Fech The Ferret especially caters to those who gotta go fast and would rather climb walls than do precise platforming, but you can also enjoy it at your own pace and explore this rich world in search of secrets, or perhaps chat with some Marmocleans."</p>

<p>Sounds like a fun idea, so will be keeping an eye on this one. If you do give it a go, let us know what you think in the comments, it's fun to see more music games come along for sure.</p>
<p>You can try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382980/Fech_The_Ferret/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and also <a href="https://raoulwb.itch.io/fech-the-ferret" target="_blank">follow on itch.io</a> too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a set of nice bug fixes in a new client update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Deck Client Update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3323108691045398493" target="_blank">out now</a> pulling in some rather useful sounding bug fixes. They've actually slowed down a little on the updates now, which is actually good to see so hopefully there's something a little bigger cooking in the Valve oven once again.</p>
<p>Here's what's new from the June 28th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where clicking in-game links when offline would get Steam Deck into a bad state</li>
<li>Fixed navigation issues in the game EULA dialog</li>
<li>Fixed crashing issue when deleting a screenshot</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator failing to load when Steam Cloud is disabled</li>
<li>Fixed configurator failing to load when encountering corrupted controller layout files</li>
<li>Fixed controller virtual menus being limited to 4 active menus</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing the touchscreen to occasionally be stuck in mouse-emulation mode when accessing the configurator in-game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there anything specific you're wanting to be added or fixed on the Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments. I'm off to go update mine now…</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, from Thursday June 30th Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">will be doubling</a> the number of Steam Decks going out each time as production has ramped up. A designer at Valve also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-designer-warns-people-not-to-put-2242-m2-drives-in-their-steam-deck/" target="_blank">warned against</a> sticking in SSDs that are too big.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we say goodbye to Q2 and hello to Q3, Valve has confirmed that production of Steam Deck units has increased to the point where they're going to be sending out a lot more.</p>
<p>Today is one of the usual days for emails to go out (so check your inbox) and Thursday is the other day where it happens. From <em>this</em> Thursday (30th June), things will be just a bit different. Confirming the details on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1541459263444332544" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the official OnDeck account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th. Production has picked up, and after today we'll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You can check your reservation status on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck page</a>. Also don't worry if you miss your email, you do <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/missed-your-steam-deck-email-valve-confirms-a-grace-period-to-still-get-one/" target="_blank">get another chance</a> to get a Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Designer Lawrence Yang, who <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-designer-warns-people-not-to-put-2242-m2-drives-in-their-steam-deck/" target="_blank">recently warned people</a> about certain SSD upgrades, also mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1541459415361921024" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>

      <title>Kingdoms and Castles gets Steam Deck and gamepad support, VR version coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little castle building and AI conquering on the go? Kingdoms and Castles already worked great on Linux with the Native version and now it should be great on the Steam Deck too. Only recently they put out a huge update to the game with AI Kingdoms too.</p>
<p>The developer said they "worked hard to implement intuitive gamepad controls that make it easy to build and manage your kingdom and we've tweaked the UI to work well for the Deck's screen size". It won't mess with anyone using a mouse so no worries there but it also means on PC overall you get gamepad support if you want it. You just need to tick Console Controls in the options (default on Deck).</p>
<p>Here's a short demo of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rDJthIdBdac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce09dcce60ad7c41abdc7a671fc527ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rDJthIdBdac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they've teased these are coming next for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Fixing bugs - you may have noticed a few small hotpatches over the past few weeks, more to come soon.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">New stuff for the AI Kingdoms based on your feedback so far (for example, getting that pesky aggressive AI to stop asking for tribute after defeating them in a war, and being able to demand tribute yourself).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">VR version of the game - this is well underway and feels really cool. We'll have some progress to show here soon.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>CorsixTH the modern game engine for Theme Hospital v0.66 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CorsixTH is the absolute best way to play the classic Theme Hospital on any modern system and version 0.66 is now out.</p>
<p>While there's the newer Two Point Hospital from some of the original team, you're simply never going to beat Theme Hospital in my heart since not only is nostalgia at play but it remains a highly enjoyable sim thanks to it being such a great game at the time. CorsixTH keeping it a live with plenty of enhancements helps too of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in v0.66-beta1 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Direct Zoom has been improved and is now enabled by default</li>
<li>Nurses can now leave the ward without disturbing her patients</li>
<li>Patients with Serious Radiation now glow a beautiful shade of green</li>
<li>Patients with Jellyitis now wobble wobble wobble</li>
<li>The Hotkeys menu has been overhauled to make it easier to use</li>
<li>You can now reset your zoom level by pressing '0'</li>
<li>A new fax code cheat has been added!</li>
<li>The replace machine prompt will now tell you the new strength before purchase (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>A machine's dynamic info will tell you the strength a machine can be upgraded to if you replaced it (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>Improved pee and vomit conditions</li>
<li>Patients will no longer queue for reception until nearby</li>
<li>The Adviser will no longer queue repetitive messages</li>
<li>Dropdown menus will now close when clicked outside of</li>
<li>Non-visual diseases can now be delayed in the level config of a custom game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus the usual assorted bug fixes. It's mostly the same as the Beta release I covered back in May, plus a few additional fixes that were discovered during testing. Not many changelogs will give you the likes of improved peeing and vomiting but here we are, what a gem.</p>

      <title>Pokete is a Pokemon-like game for your terminal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy catching some creatures? How about directly in your terminal window? Pokete is a free and open source Pokemon-like. Just like the classics it features various creatures across different types like Plant, Water, Fire and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>It's currently in active development but it's already quite playable with a long list of features. In the last month it only just had another major release adding in smarter NPCs, achievements, fights with multiple Poketes, in-game time for day and night Poketes encounters and you now get transported to safety if all your Poketes faint during a battle just like a certain other game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7022901491656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7022901491656337431gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5252310631656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5252310631656337431gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty fun idea for a terminal game really, can't wait to watch it evolve.</p>

      <title>Spaceship building game Reassembly goes 64bit, gets Linux and Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reassembly is a highly rated game that mixes spaceship building, exploration and intense combat. It's quite a little gem and has a big update out now. One I was somewhat addicted to back when it originally released in 2015.</p>
<p>With a lot of variety on the parts available to build you ships, it's a little like snapping together LEGO. If you love space combat and building, it's one to check out. Quite amazing to see it still continue to be updated this long after release. As on June 24th here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add 64 bit windows binaries. Should improve performance a bit, especially when many mods are installed.</li>
<li>Add 64 bit linux binaries, and update linux compiler to gcc-9. Linux support now requires a 64 bit OS.</li>
<li>Update mac compiler. Now requires OSX 10.12.</li>
<li>Multi-threaded ship loading. Noticeably faster loading when many mods are installed</li>
<li>UI fixes for steam deck. Scrolling credits with bigger fonts, move some "flying" controls into "advanced", open the on-screen keyboard when relevant, etc.</li>
<li>Fix corruption crash when an explosion creates more explosions</li>
<li>Replace libcurl with cpphhtplib. Should be transparent, and fix some linux issues related to out of date libcrypt etc.</li>
<li>Fix AI for rocket turrets</li>
<li>Fix dancing thruster bug</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Valve has currently rated it was "Playable" for the Steam Deck.</em></p>

Another that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter with $95,204 this one definitely needs to be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>"Arcadian Atlas is a unique, narrative-driven isometric tactical RPG set in Arcadia, a nation tearing itself apart via political and familial factions, nefarious plots, treacherous alliances and clandestine intrigues just as ancient evil forces begin to awaken. With a queen willing to do anything to ascend to the throne, no one is safe."</p>
<p>You build up a party from more than 12 custom classes, with each having their own unique skill types and equipment. It's very character-driven, with the developer explaining that every action during battle will count as "just one wrong move could tear your family, its political alliances and the land itself apart for good".</p>
<p>Have a looksie at the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Low-poly 3D rail shooter Ex-Zodiac hits Early Access on July 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little early birthday present for me, Ex-Zodiac is a low-poly 3D rail shooter (think like Star Fox) that now has a release date. It's going to release with Native Linux support on July 21st, following on from the successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020.</p>
<p>With the initial release it will have 6 main stages and 6 bonus stages, which the publisher said brings "the 80's/90's nostalgia to a new level".</p>
<p>See one of the original trailers below but there's a newer sneak-peak on <a href="https://twitter.com/BenHickling/status/1539275535301353474" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>12 main levels (plus secret areas and side-paths)</li>
<li>Multiple routes to complete the game</li>

      <title>Valve designer warns people not to put 2242 M.2 drives in their Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, one <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1539296261613944833" target="_blank">modder</a> decided to stick a bigger 2242 M.2 SSD into their Steam Deck and after many other bigger PC sites picked it up — a Valve designer has warned people not to do it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck was designed to specifically fit the much smaller 2230 M.2 and while it appears the 2242 can work, this appears to be a case of being so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. <em>To completely pinch a quote from Jurassic Park.</em></p>
<p>Designer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1540809830000013313" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__nly0s773drk" lang="en">Hi, please don’t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for. This mod may appear to work but will significantly shorten the life of your Deck.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The modder <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1541160087900901376" target="_blank">replied</a> to agree too.</em></p>
<p>Remember, Valve did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/get-a-look-inside-the-steam-deck-in-valves-latest-video/" target="_blank">their own</a> teardown of the device but repeatedly told people to leave things to the professionals. However, they also teamed up with iFixit to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">offer spare parts</a> too.</p>
<p>Best to stick to the smaller 2230 series if you really wish to open it up and put a bigger one in, <em>or</em> just put in a good Micro SD that works well and still loads everything quickly. Don't go following every crazy idea you see online, even when big sites report on it.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a huge free accessibility upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells is a great game. Not only does it look great but the action is awesome. However, it is rather difficult and for some nearly impossible so the developers have put out a huge free upgrade to help more people play it.</p>
<p>A rather admirable update really, as accessibility should never be looked down upon and during their testing the developer said they received "pretty much zero negative feedback on the general options that we're introducing". However their new Assist Mode that gives multiple lives, auto-hitting and adjustable trap damage did receive community "pushback". Addressing that in an update they made it clear the whole point is to "let people to enjoy the game who would otherwise be excluded from doing so" and it's entirely optional.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loads of new options to improve accessibility, such as adjustable font type &amp; size, input customisation and individual adjustment of sound effect volumes</li>
<li>Assist Mode including customisation of enemy health/damage, trap speed/damage and parry window. Plus options for multiple lives, auto-hit with primary weapon &amp; full map reveal</li>
<li>Big reduction in cell cost of early-game weapons</li>
<li>7 weapon reworks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Can't wait to dive back in with all this, sounds amazing.</p>

      <title>Grim Horde is chaotic and there&#39;s a good game hiding in there</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grim Horde is a game that released into Early Access with Native Linux support and it's another fast-paced rogue-lite hell in a slightly similar way to the chaos found in Vampire Survivors only you control a horde of minions.</p>
<p>You float around as a demon lord, lead armies and crush various villages and take on the pesky people in a sort-of auto-battling way. Since you mainly just control your demon lord, your army is running around doing the damage while you're trying to avoid arrows and all sorts.</p>
<p>Once you die you rise again and keep going. It could end up as another fun little game to keep coming back to once it has been further developed but there's a good idea for a game here I'm just not entirely sure on the execution of it just yet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZM0bVNjSsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f1410a779e92cfcdbe2bbd59624593b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZM0bVNjSsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly rough around the edges and needs some work so I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962560/Grim_Horde/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Gorgeous turn-based tactics game Tyrant&#39;s Blessing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from their successful Kickstarter campaign, Tyrant's Blessing now has a release date and a brand new trailer and it's looking rather good. Seems like a fun blending of styles from Final Fantasy Tactics and Into the Breach! It's confirmed to be launching on August 8th with Native Linux support and there's a demo available on Steam.</p>
<p>"Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LaFT1xdd_4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eae9b67780c2e015a2fa51c32829d3b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LaFT1xdd_4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising.</li>
<li>As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer.</li>
<li>Pick your heroic roster carefully. Screeg, the elder wizard advising the Uprising, can only teleport three heroes and a pet at once: Do you send your elite warriors in? Or rookies to train and hold the line? Are they up to the task? Can you handle the consequences?</li>
<li>Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle.</li>
<li>But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest.</li>
<li>Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group.</li>
<li>Even if heroes fall, they can still be freed from the Tyrant's grasp. Track them down, defeat them in combat, and restore them back to their stolen life!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve continues tweaking Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and they continue focusing on Steam Input improvements, to make playing it with a controller and the Steam Deck a better experience.</p>
<p>Seems they're trying to help controller players catch up at least a tiny bit with those using a mouse, with plenty of working going into changing how gyros work. Quite a small patch overall though but it sounds like some pretty fun and welcome changes, although Gyros Akimbo does sound somewhat hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck now allows other game controllers to be connected via Steam Input. All connected controllers combine inputs. (You can play with Gyros Akimbo if you are very cool).</li>
<li>“Pitch and Roll Combined” is the new default Gyro conversion on Steam Deck. All other controllers default to “Yaw”</li>
<li>Radial menus (in particular, Quick Buy radials) no longer persist when dying.</li>
<li>Some glyph fixes in Spectator mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did try out CS:GO on Deck myself and was tempted to video it but lets just say it was embarrassing. It's a very tough game to really get into on a controller of any sort. If you have a Deck, have you been playing CS:GO on it? Let us know what your experience has been in the comments.</p>
<p>You can play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank"> free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>With a quick script you can run Steam Deck Desktop Mode inside Gaming Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're going into ridiculous territory of tweaking now and the possibilities are seemingly endless on what you can do with the Steam Deck. You can even run the Desktop Mode inside of Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uddyat/desktop_mode_within_gaming_mode/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, the script is pretty simple and only needs you to add the commands into a text file, set it as executable and add it to Steam as a Non-Steam game. From there, you can launch and switch between desktop mode and games running in the background and it actually works. It's far from perfect with some issues where the desktop mode may freeze up so you need to quit it with certain games, and sometimes the mouse won't go to the very bottom but hey — this is the kind of awesome stuff you can do with Linux right?</p>
<p>Here's a brief demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3uJeqafjwsc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfa99ec6e4a2899d865f1a40f46e2dcc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3uJeqafjwsc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love it. If you try it, don't blame me if you break something. Just wanted to highlight something mildly amusing and also somewhat useful too.</p>

      <title>Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop devs detail their support of Proton and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, a community updated and expanded version of the free Alien Swarm originally by Valve continues to see lots of improvements. The developers also explained their clear support of Linux with Proton and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Released by Valve originally in 2010, Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop continues the much lesser-known Valve title with an impressive set of extras. It doesn't have Native Linux support like other Valve titles and the Reactive Drop Team has explained it likely never will due to the specific Source engine build used. However "making the game run well on Proton was and continues to be a priority" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">they say</a>.</p>
<p>A bunch of improvements also came along for gamepad and Steam Deck users including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved controller navigation order on several menus.</li>
<li>Made several in-game menus including the briefing menu navigable using ControllerFocus (the red/yellow flashing border).</li>
<li>Added controller button prompts to several places, including the game instructor.</li>
<li>Redesigned some menus entirely, such as the mission selection screen.</li>
<li>Enlarged the main font size on smaller resolutions.</li>
<li>Added a new radial menu system for selecting marines with the d-pad.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said to let them know if you have problems on Linux / Steam Deck in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">this thread in the forum</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to see more developers do direct support like this. Here's a short video to show it working well:</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Paladins working on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh upgrade for Proton Experimental on June 22nd which brings even more game compatibility to Linux desktops and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Listed as now playable as of this update includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation</li>
<li>Paladins</li>
</ul>
<p>Paladins is an interesting one, as it was sort-of playable for a while using a few workarounds and an older version of GE-Proton but now having it in the official Proton is going to make it so much easier.</p>
<p>This update also solves Tekken 7 crashing at launch and more work has been done on video playback, with many games that previous requires special hacks in Proton no longer being required including: The Long Dark, Trailmakers, Surviving the Aftermath, Haven, TOHU, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, V Rising and more.</p>
<p>The changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a> at any time.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's also a quick video overview and a short look at Paladins running on the Steam Deck. It's not perfected yet with a few issues remaining but it's starting to get there and performance seems good.</p>

      <title>AMD publishes the source code for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As they promised they would, AMD has now officially published the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2" target="_blank">source code</a> for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) under an open source license. With it under the MIT license, developers can pretty much go nuts with it.</p>
<p>This tech is their newer and more advanced temporal upscaling solution, supporting the Vulkan and DirectX 12 graphics APIs, it's fully supported on Linux and works on different vendor GPUs (not just AMDs). AMD say it "uses cutting-edge temporal algorithms to reconstruct fine geometric and texture detail, producing anti-aliased output from aliased input". Developed from the ground-up, it's quite a big difference from FSR 1 to provide even better performance and clearer images. Developers can even use both since they're so different.</p>
<p>FSR 2 features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Temporal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivers similar or better than native image quality using temporal data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-aliasing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes high-quality anti-aliasing.
	<ul>
<li>FSR 2 replaces any TAA within the game frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High image quality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher image quality than FSR 1 technology at all quality presets/resolutions.
	<ul>
<li>Different quality modes available.</li>
<li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No machine learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does not require dedicated Machine Learning (ML) hardware.
	<ul>
<li>More platforms can benefit.</li>
<li>Gives more control to cater to a range of different scenarios.</li>
<li>Better ability to optimize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cross-platform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts framerates in supported games.
	<ul>
<li>Wide range of products and platforms, both AMD and select competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a number of their comparisons on their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution-2/" target="_blank">GPUOpen website</a>.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk point and click adventure Born Punk is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Born Punk is a brand new cyberpunk point and click adventure from developer Insert Disk 22. It just released on Steam on June 18th and now a Native Linux version is also available. Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, it's nice to see a trickle of games still coming from the crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>"In Born Punk, the player slips into the role of three people (well, two people, depending on your stance on artificial lifeforms) living on the island: Eevi, a corporate combat hacker turned bartender down on her luck; Mariposa, the CEO of Bornholm's biggest corporation; and a malfunctioning android who calls himself Grandmaster Flashdrive.</p>
<p>The three characters have one thing in common: they all, one after another, get possessed by strange entities of unknown origin and even less known intentions. They must work together - and sometimes against each other - to find out of the nature of those beings, what they want, and why they seem to think that their 'mission' is of vital importance for the future of humanity."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cBJ5mo_rDTk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64100af9ee33066cb1850240479715f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cBJ5mo_rDTk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A classic point-and-click adventure experience:</strong> we're very proud to feature our own distinct style, but we are also definitely influenced by games like Monkey Island or Beneath a Steel Sky and try to please both veteran afficionados of the genre and newcomers alike with a traditional pixel-art appearance and a streamlined, modern approach to game design</li>
<li><strong>Movement everywhere:</strong> you won't feel like you're walking through a still life painting; Born Punk's world is alive and full of animation, soundscapes and small details to discover</li>
<li><strong>Choices and consequences:</strong> often, it's possible to approach dialogues and puzzles from different angles. As a result, interactions and dialogues with other characters, the difficulty to overcome certain obstacles, and the results of many actions will vary greatly depending on what the player chooses to do</li>
<li><strong>Full voice-overs:</strong> every character in Born Punk and every line is voiced by professional voice actors. Yes, that includes the cat.</li>
<li><strong>Bombastic music:</strong> the main theme and various other tracks are composed by Jeff Kurtenacker, composer of Wildstar and choral arranger of World of Warcraft. Jeff is joined by a merry band of synthwave musicians to create a genuine and emotional cyberpunk/sci-fi soundtrack with a Nordic twist</li>
<li><strong>Let's be serious, it's funny:</strong> Born Punk is science-fiction with heavy cyberpunk influences; but we're also boasting a hopeful, often humorous undertone. Point &amp; click adventures without at least a bit of humour are unthinkable to us!</li>
<li><strong>A comprehensive universe:</strong> there's a slew of background info to read and experience, all of which becomes available in your PDA as you interact with the game world. Sometimes, in-game lore will also serve as an optional gameplay mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979480/Born_Punk/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently both <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/born_punk" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://insertdisk22.itch.io/born-punk" target="_blank">itch.io</a> only have the Windows builds.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a surprise update fixing many problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Valve are getting back into fixing up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, which has been a long-time coming and after fans have been campaigning to get Valve to do something.</p>
<p>TF2 has had so many problems with bots over the last year or two, that it became largely unplayable most often as bots would just repeatedly ruin games. There were other issues but that was the biggest. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/valve-say-they-will-look-into-fixing-up-the-bot-problems-in-team-fortress-2/" target="_blank">Valve said back in May</a> they were listening and would do something about it.</p>
<p>On June 21st a fresh update was released that fixed quite a few exploits like being able to clear the in-game text chat and players could use cheats on secure servers amongst other annoyances. There's various bug fixes too like projectiles sometimes colliding with teammates too early / late and the Spy using the incorrect weapons when disguised.</p>
<p>Another addition in this patch is an updated voting system that should also help that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both teams can have a kick vote running at the same time</li>
<li>Can have a global vote running at the same time as a kick vote</li>
<li>Fixed sometimes not being able to vote on maps at the end of the round</li>
</ul>
<p>Really great to see Valve giving TF2 some love. It remains as one of the most popular games available on Steam and it appears this patch has bumped the player numbers up once again.</p>

      <title>Inscryption from Daniel Mullins Games now supported on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The mixture of a deckbuilding roguelike with escape-room style puzzles and psychological horror in Inscryption is now officially available for Linux with a Native build. Developed by Daniel Mullins Games and published by Devolver Digital, this very popular and well-reviewed game originally released back in October 2021.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developer noted that while working on the Linux (and macOS) ports that they "came across some issues that have existed in the Windows version since Kaycee's Mod" so thanks to the porting work the game will be improving for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WDAJ10sjpPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/856b0175cdbdf8372ac9250eb50eb631.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WDAJ10sjpPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creator of Pony Island and The Hex comes the latest mind melting, self-destructing love letter to video games. Inscryption is an inky black card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie. Darker still are the secrets inscrybed upon the cards...</p>
<p>In Inscryption you will...</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire a deck of woodland creature cards by draft, surgery, and self mutilation</li>
<li>Unlock the secrets lurking behind the walls of Leshy's cabin</li>
<li>Embark on an unexpected and deeply disturbing odyssey</li>
</ul>

      <title>Meet me at NooN is a sweet new puzzler with time-loop mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Meet me at NooN is the first game from the duo at Pandaroo Interactive and quite an impressive entry to the puzzle genre.</p>
<p>In the game you control two spirits that create time loops of their day. So each move you do is recorded and played back, while you're controlling the other. It's pretty fun to see in action and while simple, quite an enjoyable little experience to watch and learn and go through the levels. The good thing is that this is a game with no pressure. There's no way to actually lose and no timers so you go at your own pace. If you go wrong you can just adjust the timeline and go back.</p>

      <title>RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent gets a great looking roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a pixel-art RTS that resembles some of the classics like Age of Empires. It's currently in Early Access with Native Linux support and their new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1674820/view/5967847045493589913" target="_blank">roadmap</a> looks great.</p>
<p>Inspired by real history of the Near East Bronze Age era, TFC utilizes classic RTS elements while offering a unique perspective for the genre. One big change is how Food is not just used for building up your army but also changes how your population grows, and how quickly you can gain Knowledge Points to do research. It's a very interesting system that feels quite different to others like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z6qLkWwHx4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02477f4d339ac25c54e11aec5b3f3e1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z6qLkWwHx4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their new roadmap shows that across this year they plan to add in more single-player skirmish options, the ability to play against AI with friends online, an online co-op horde mode, neutral settlements, hotkey customization and unit stances. That's only for this year. Next year they have some other big updates planned too like new civilizations, new technologies, new map types like oceans and rivers, multiplayer matchmaking and more.</p>
<p>All sounding pretty great and it's easily worth playing right now.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the awesome GZDoom game engine, Hands of Necromancy looks like another solid choice for those of you (like me!) who absolutely love retro shooters. Made in the spirit of the classics like Heretic, Hexen, Doom and Quake it does look pretty good.</p>
<p>"You are a Necromancer: a lone sorcerer who seeks to grow ever more powerful and learn new forms of dark magic. You search for challengers to fight, so you can hone your wicked craft. You destroy many monsters and wild creatures, yet none of them seem truly worth the fight...</p>
<p>However, one day, suddenly more creatures entering your world. You know something bad is happening, but maybe this is an opportunity to prove your might and show the world that you are the truly fearsome mage you always knew yourself to be."</p>

<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>3,500 games now Steam Deck Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great milestone has been hit for the Steam Deck, with Valve's popular Linux-powered handheld now having 3,500 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Back on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/new-steam-deck-verified-titles-now-over-3200-playable/" target="_blank">June 7th</a> it only just hit 3,200 so the rate continues at a nice steady pace. As a reminder though, Deck Verified is just the formal verification system. Plenty of games that haven't been tested work just fine, and some that are listed as Unsupported also work fine (or can do with one or two tweaks). You also have access to emulation and retro gaming, external launchers and much more. The Steam Deck is incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>The numbers right now at time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified: 1755</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable: 1803</div>

      <title>Erannorth Chronicles gets fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Erannorth Chronicles, what the developer says blends together an old-school card game with tabletop RPG-like progression recently had an upgrade to make it work nicely on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A game all about freedom, with some pretty deep mechanics allowing you to build up your character and your deck of cards while you explore a giant sandbox world with many different locations, challenges, and treasure hunts. There's no big story to follow, so the game is very much what you make of it. The intention from the developer appears to be giving you a big playground to have a run through and see what you can create and conquer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently tagged as Unsupported by Valve on the Steam Deck, a new release went up on June 12th aiming to fix up some issues so hopefully this will bump it up to at least Playable officially.</p>
<p>Here's what they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a check if the game is running in Steam Deck to set the resolution to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. As the game only supports that.</li>
<li>Settings for the Steam Deck will be stored in a separate file. The corresponding settings will load based on whether you are running the game on Steam Deck or your PC.</li>
<li>The split effect wasn't displaying in the non-Damage cards, which could be confusing as to why it appears if a Damage effect was added to them.</li>
<li>Chaotic effect in Split cards didn't have a visual indication that its damage would Split. It will now display both elements.</li>
<li>Updated Unity to v2021.3.4.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Looks like Valve are gearing up for a new &#39;Deckard&#39; VR Headset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've sort-of known for a while that Valve were working towards a next-generation VR headset to succeed the Valve Index and we've now seen a lot more supporting evidence that it's getting closer.</p>
<p>Plenty of this is thanks to the tireless work of XR Hardware Analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a>, who had been keeping an eye out for anything interesting that pops up. The codename of the device appears to be "Deckard", and a lot of the information is actually thanks to SteamDB who constantly track updates to Steam code on their <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-SteamVR" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where you can see a lot of the text strings being added in preparation.</p>
<p>You can see Lynch go over plenty of the leaked info in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ovlbXVwoN8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a31ac79f35ae73506de165abfa36c975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ovlbXVwoN8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a huge fan of the Valve Index, which I took a look at some time ago, the idea that we might be able to play without wires hooked up to a PC is thoroughly exciting. Even more exciting, is that it's quite likely in any standalone mode that it would use Linux, which is again a good reason for Valve to continue working on Proton outside of the use on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Then there's also the <a href="https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20220187609&amp;IDKey=62CCF93BD70F" target="_blank">recent Patent</a>, which shows off a possible new design of Valve's upcoming VR headset. The patent was filed in December 2021, and went public on June 16 2022. The patent is focused more on the fitting with the strap system, rather than going into technical details on how it will function. Still, we do get a little hint as to what it may have with the patent mentioning "the rear housing may house wireless transceivers, a battery, microphones, input/output devices, processors" and it also mentions the front may have "antenna(s)" and a few other references that do indicate wireless play.</p>
<p>Obviously it's not a confirmation that one will actually be released but still fun to see and clearly Valve are working on something big.</p>

      <title>Missed your Steam Deck email? Valve confirms a grace period to still get one</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Given how busy some of us are, it can still be quite easy to miss that Steam Deck email coming in to make your purchase through the reservation system. The good news is, you do actually have a few extra days after the timer is up.</p>
<p>The way the system works is that you put down a reservation (only one per Steam account at a time), and <em>eventually</em> you get the chance to buy a Steam Deck. This has helped against scalpers buying them all up and allow Valve to have time to produce enough. Once you get your final purchase email, you have about 72 hours to actually pay for it otherwise it's supposed to go onto the next person in the queue. The purchase email even clearly says " If you don't complete your purchase by this time, we will automatically cancel your reservation.".</p>
<p>However, Valve has now officially <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1538949772010086400" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that's <em>not</em> quite the case.</p>
<p>If you do <em>miss</em> that window of opportunity to buy your Steam Deck, there "is a grace period of a few days" where you can reach out to Steam Support who will hook you up. All you need to do is go to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck" target="_blank">support page</a>, and hit "Contact Steam Support".</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve are giving people more than one opportunity to ensure they get their Deck.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 17: The Llama Master</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-16-we-are-all-doomed/" target="_blank">Part 16: We Are All Doomed</a></strong></p>
<p>While first person shooters dominated the Linux gaming scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was still more than a place for the venerable strategy genre; it should be remembered that the first game Loki Software ported over to Linux was the then latest iteration in the <em>Civilization</em> series. From this foundation other strategy titles soon followed, with Ubi Soft entering the fray thanks to the work of Linux friendly Philos Laboratories.</p>
<p><em>Theocracy </em>is a mix of real time and turn based strategy that sees you leading an Aztec tribe in the century leading up to the arrival of Hernán Cortés, with the ultimate goal being an alternate history scenario where the Aztecs are able to fend off the Spanish conquistadors. Beyond this the game is fantastical, inventing tribes, magical sects, fabled heroes, and featuring a whole host of fauna alien to Mesoamerica, including dragons, llamas, chickens, and the most inaccurate, pigs.</p>
<p>The game overall has an admirable depth of well crafted lore only brought down by the Hungarian developer's occasional lapse into broken English; the worst offender being the use of the word "Wary" to mean belligerent in the Diplomacy Panel. The narrator for the tutorial and scenario briefings also has a way with words that can be at best described as memorable, with his use of the phrase "llama masters can be educated in the llama lair" being a particular earworm. </p>
<p>Unlike with games from Loki Software or similar porting houses, Philos Laboratories bundled the Linux version alongside the Windows retail release, making <em>Theocracy</em> that much easier to track down. On the first CD-ROM you can find a directory containing a text based linux.inst installer, which sets the file paths and copies over the relevant data files. From there the game can be ran using the /usr/games/theocracy binary as long as the second disc is mounted.</p>
<p>The Linux version demands the game be launched at 16 bit colour depth and shows at a fixed 800x600 resolution, either in windowed mode or borderless fullscreen. Cutscenes meanwhile are displayed at 640x480 without any kind of scaling. The option for grabbing the mouse inside the game window only applies while in Province View, and I was unable to have the game recognize the keyboard from Blackbox, forcing me to play <em>Theocracy</em> from Gnome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376340911655670281gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/376340911655670281gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10974161811655690882gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10974161811655690882gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Released in March 2000 with a historical theme and similar art style, <em>Theocracy</em> was most often compared to and was largely overshadowed by <em>Age of Empires</em>, even though they are very different games. In terms of my tactics I actually found more in common with Infinity Engine titles such as <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Icewind Dale</em>, with the emphasis on choke points, crowd control, magical buffing, experience leveling, and war party formation while in combat.</p>
<p>I do not think I ever won a battle by outnumbering the opposing army; instead, most of my success came from causing the enemy troops to trip over themselves, often aided by the game's ropy path finding. The sheer scale of the rival forces and the lack of difficulty modes make <em>Theocracy</em> more intimidating than it needs to be, but with effort I was able to defeat both the Iztahuacans and Teotitlans in 30 years in-game and had a close to clear run to the Spanish.</p>
<p>In the end it was not the game's difficulty that felled me, but an unfortunate bug. Upon exceeding 52 saved games from the same campaign <em>Theocracy</em> will start corrupting your save files, a laughable ceiling given how much trial and error is required to progress through the game. Some have reported being able to get past this point by correcting the number overflows in the save file using a hex editor, but I have not managed this feat myself at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Apart from this though <em>Theocracy</em> only froze for me once, although the performance at times left something to be desired. Despite the boast on the back of the box of "an amazing game engine" that can display "up to 50000 units on the screen without any slowdown", the game would still lag even with my hardware exceeding the recommended specifications. This was even worse under Windows 98, with the Linux version running noticeably smoother.</p>
<p>All of these things can make <em>Theocracy</em> feel as if it has been lost to time, much like the Aztecs themselves. There has been some success in getting the game running in a dedicated X session on later versions of Linux, but few games benefit from having access to retro hardware as much as this. I still have unfinished business with <em>Theocracy</em>, and I am not waving the white flag just yet, but for now I am in the mood for something lighter, and much less time consuming.</p>

      <title>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck is absolutely awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck, a classic from back in the Xbox 360 days has a version on Steam and it works so beautifully on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is a true bit of nostalgia hitting for me, as I continue to put hour after hour into various games on Steam Deck, I keep coming back to the classics. Geometry Wars was originally a mini-game in Project Gotham Racing 2 it was later turned into Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved as a standalone title and went onto become one of the most downloaded Xbox Live Arcade games.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to Steam Play Proton, it works out of the box as a Deck Verified title. You only need to go into the settings and put it to the correct resolution — and then dive in for many hours of blasting away various shapes with a good 6 hours easily on the battery life with it at 60FPS. It look simply amazing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r9FcR1i5WnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba13fc019c9c035343fb23bdec83ae68.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r9FcR1i5WnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This to me, really shows how incredibly the Steam Deck is. Not only will it play some of the latest AAA games (although often in lower visuals and 30/40 FPS), you can emulate tons of other systems but also get back into classics like this that you can enjoy wherever you are.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/8400/Geometry_Wars_Retro_Evolved/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Westwood classic RPG &#39;Nox&#39; lives on with the OpenNox game engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Westwood Studios made quite a lot of games like Dune II and the Command &amp; Conquer series but they also made an RPG called Nox, that now lives on with the <a href="https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox" target="_blank">OpenNox</a> game engine. OpenNox just recently had a new release, and the project is now open source too under the GPL!</p>
<p>Released originally in the year 2000, Nox was received very well by the gaming press at the time and lives on in the hearts of many gamers. Thankfully now though, OpenNox gives you a fresh way to play it on modern platforms like Linux and Windows. OpenNox is a fully-featured game engine reimplementation too supporting the original features plus plenty of enhancements including: improving modding support, higher resolutions, much better online play and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like other open source reimplementations, it does not include copyrighted assets and so you do need to own a copy of the game to play it which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/nox" target="_blank">buy on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton and Wine updater ProtonUp-Qt now shows anti-cheat status</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another update to the free and open source app <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> giving you a proper user interface for downloading GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda, Wine-GE and others for Steam Deck and Linux. It works with Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and Lutris.</p>
<p>Version 2.6.5 brings the ability to see the anti-cheat status in the game list you can open. A pretty useful little addition, since a previous version also added showing Steam Deck compatibility too so now you can get it together all in one list. Additionally this update will also show what games using Lutris too in the compatibility info.</p>

      <title>Microsoft chucks GNOME $10,000 from their FOSS Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everyone knows that Microsoft absolutely loves Linux right? Well, that's debatable but hey they did just reach down the back of the sofa and chuck GNOME some cash.</p>
<p>As part of their ongoing <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software Fund</a> (FOSS Fund for short), part of their Microsoft Open Source Programs Office, Microsoft engineers participate in selecting various projects they feel could benefit from a little extra help. No strings attached, no big fancy marketing of Microsoft trying to do something nefarious, just Microsoft workers voting to give out some money to free and open source projects they find interesting.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago it was announced that GNOME was the latest winner of $10,000. Previous winners include systemd, OpenStreetMap, QEMU and various others.</p>
<p>Every month they start a new selection process, which results in a new project getting the $10,000 bonus which is usually paid in 10 monthly installments of $1,000. There's only a few requirements to be considered including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The open source project must be used by Microsoft.</li>
<li>Project is actively prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion.</li>
<li>The project must have an <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">OSI-approved open source license</a></li>
<li>Needs to have a way to receive funds that our procurement and legal teams are happy with (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is great!)</li>
<li>the project cannot be owned by a Microsoft employee</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a side-note, it's quite interesting to see that even Microsoft see the OSI as the go-to for proper open source licenses.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II reimplementation gets big audio improvements and AI speedup</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine reimplementation, fheroes2, has another great new release out continuing to be the absolute best way to play this classic on modern platforms.</p>
<p>The developer emailed in to let us know about some big changes. Firstly, it's had a huge overhaul to the audio code. Not only will it properly resume audio from where it was stopped (like the original game), it will also now update the surrounding sounds on the map on every step on the hero. Plus fixes to some incorrect sounds and rocks in water with seagulls now have their own sound. On top of that, a 3D Audio feature was added for objects on the map to give it a whole new depth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AI is now smarter (yes, again!) and even faster at calculations than before making the whole game feel smoother and play better.</p>
<p>New Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduce music resuming while switching tracks for MP3, FLAC and OGG music formats</li>
<li>Add 3D audio option for objects on Adventure Map</li>
<li>Fix all map lose / win conditions and make AI be aware of them</li>
<li>Add Campaign High Scores</li>
<li>Improve German, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian translations and add Belarusian, Spanish and Swedish translations</li>
<li>Speed up AI by average 10%</li>
<li>Fix rendering of Red Tower of Sorceress castle</li>
<li>Rework "No interface" option</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>40</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.15 release</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Cycle: Frontier works nicely on Steam Deck and Linux desktops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Initially an Epic Store exclusive, you can now play The Cycle: Frontier free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868270/The_Cycle_Frontier/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and thanks to Proton — on Steam Deck and Linux desktops.</p>
<p>An interesting point about this game, is that it uses BattlEye but it appears the developer has it fully online for Linux. You only need to ensure you install the "Proton BattlEye Runtime" in your Steam Library and then it will just work with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">latest Proton 7.0-3 release</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A mixture of player versus player first-person combat, with it blending in environmental dangers from various creatures and a big storm too. The idea is that you jump in solo or with a crew, loot away and do missions and attempt extraction whenever you want to keep your goods or die trying and lose a bunch. It's a lot of fun actually and while not perfect, the developer seems to have a clear plan to keep improving it and it's already one of the most popular games on Steam.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on both Steam Deck and my Fedora 36 desktop:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck back to being the global top seller (by revenue) on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a brief stint at number 2 thanks to the popularity of V Rising, the Steam Deck has moved firmly back into place at number 1 on the top sellers list.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> tracking it, we can see that the Steam Deck has been the top seller by revenue for the last 3 weeks. We don't know how many units that is though, since Valve don't allow anyone to see. This means that overall, the Steam Deck has been at least number 1 or number 2 on the global top sellers for around <u>15</u> weeks now.</p>
<p>While we don't know the number, we know it's going to be quite high. When you take into account that V Rising hit over 1.5 million sales, Elden Ring still sits in the top-ten and has sold multiple million and…you get the idea. While the Steam Deck costs a lot more, it still means it has sold quite a lot. So the Steam Deck is very much a <strong>big</strong> success for Valve overall.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a></em></p>
<p>It quickly became my own number 1 way to play games. The convenience of it is just simply amazing. I fully expect it to continue flicking between number 1 and 2 for another year yet, which will depend on what big releases appear on Steam to push it down momentarily.</p>

      <title>Arthurian legend merged with sci-fi horror, The Hand of Merlin is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another turn-based RPG with some rogue-lite mechanics, with the addition of a pretty strange storyline? The Hand of Merlin is out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The Hand of Merlin is a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend clashes with dark and foreboding sci-fi horror. This unusual merging of genres introduces a wholly unique sci-fi element to its storytelling. Utilizing both squad-based and turn-based combat, players can employ tactical cunning to use cover, set up ambushes and coordinate attacks with ranged, melee and spell-casting combat to conquer both human and unworldly abhorrent creatures and other enemy characters they encounter on their quest.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="az8yilwPtiI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ffe249544660e9b93d7c193c1a3207b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/az8yilwPtiI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Throughout Early Access we’ve committed a lot of time and energy into community feedback with a series of updates that have really embellished the games features and replayability based upon what the community was telling us, we’re extremely pleased with the results and the work the team has done to make The Hand of Merlin a truly competitive rogue-lite RPG.“ Said Robert Sajko Creative Director at Room C Games.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-hand-of-merlin?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600610/The_Hand_of_Merlin/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE arrives on Steam — plus it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE has officially landed on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the good news is that it works on Linux plus it's Steam Deck Verified. Seems Valve were well aware to get it Deck Verified status right away, looks like we know why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-3 released recently then</a>!</p>
<p>You know the Steam Deck is getting noticed, and clearly <em>important</em> to the gaming industry, when the Final Fantasy VII series Executive Produce at Square Enix mentions it directly in the 25th Anniversary Celebration video that you can see below. I think the importance of moments like that cannot be overstated. The Steam Deck mention is at about 3:40.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wohQiEysqIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9184c75108971fa4977a83531f04ede1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wohQiEysqIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a big one, and one I was hoping to eventually play personally, I decided to dive in and take a quick look. Since it's Steam Deck Verified, every part of it <em>should</em> work well but that does depend on how thorough the verification system is, for such an expansive game.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh video for you (personal purchase from <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okmu4ra0f1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de22a1d2522cd3e38d869c7101eb133.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okmu4ra0f1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the Steam page this is what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE contains the following content:<br/>
- FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE full game<br/>
- DLC "FF7R EPISODE INTERmission" (New episode featuring Yuffie Kisaragi)<br/>
- Weapon: Cacstar<br/>
- Armor: Midgar Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Shinra Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Corneo Armlet<br/>
- Accessory: Superstar Belt<br/>
- Accessory: Mako Crystal<br/>
- Accessory: Seraphic Earrings<br/>
- Summon materia: Carbuncle<br/>
- Summon materia: Chocobo Chick<br/>
- Summon materia: Cactuar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. <em>You save a little extra if you're a Humble Choice sub too.</em></p>
<p>The next game in the series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is confirmed for 2024 but will be exclusive to the PS5. Well, for now anyway, eventually it's likely to come to Steam just like other PlayStation games have been. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion, a remake of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 for PSP, is also confirmed to be coming to Steam "this Winter".</p>
<p>Oh and if you missed it, we're even getting Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in August. So hopefully Proton will be ready for that too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An absolute gem of a game this and now perhaps a good time to go back and spend some proper time with it, as the rather large The Sunken Sea update is out now.</p>
<p>Blending elements and a feel of the likes of Minecraft, Terraria and more it's a great underground exploration and crafting game that's currently in Early Access. It continues to do well after selling 500K in two weeks.</p>
<p>The new biome can be accessed once you've defeated the first three bosses, which brings down the wall that separates the sections of the game. There's also the sub-biome Forlorn Metropolis, a new boss, a new side-boss, 5 new enemies, a fishing merchant, boats, a new workbench type, portals you can craft for teleporting around, 10 new weapons including a bow, new food and fish types and lots more. Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wrQNpT6QNQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22c933b365cc37743f1ced94584f366d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wrQNpT6QNQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to digging more into this one. Works great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with the Native Linux build that's Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Online Services gets free cross-play tooling that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games just announced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-release-free-pc-crossplay-tools?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">big upgrade</a> to Epic Online Services, which will now include a full toolkit to enable developers to do cross-play.</p>
<p>Currently, the initial release of the new tools in the EOS SDK supports "PC" (they mean Windows), but they fully plan to support Linux and macOS as well. They already support Epic and Steam directly with more stores coming and consoles / mobile support coming later. EOS includes a special overlay (like the Steam Overlay) that brings together Steam and Epic friends and all the integration into a single list.</p>
<p>For game developers, this sounds thoroughly useful.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All friends, one place.</strong> Steam and Epic Games Store friends merge into one overlay allowing players to see all friends in a single list.</li>
<li>Integrated game invites. In-game, players can search and send invites to friends across Steam and the Epic Games Store, making connecting and playing together easy.</li>
<li><strong>Account linking.</strong> Onboarding without emails or password prompts. With just a few clicks, Steam players can jump into a game while an Epic Games account is created under the hood for their Steam account.</li>
<li><strong>Update-free improvements.</strong> When games are installed, the crossplay features are distributed via a self-updating in-game overlay. Players can enjoy new features and improvements without needing to update anything themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-and-play SDK.</strong> Each Epic Online Services toolset is self-contained, so developers can mix and match the services they want to implement, incorporate the things they want, and leave the rest. Crossplay tools are no different.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully people will use this over Vivox, which still doesn't support Linux and can be quite problematic with Proton too. Even if you don't particularly like the Epic Games Store, what they offer with Epic Online Services seems pretty great.</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Terran Command on Steam Deck and Linux — a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Terran Command [<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>] just released from The Artistocrats and Slitherine Ltd. but getting it on running on Linux desktop or Steam Deck requires a few steps. Video steps at the bottom if you prefer that.</p>
<p>Technically, on a Linux desktop it works out of the box with Proton but the videos don't play. For both Steam Deck and Linux you will need the community made GE-Proton. To grab GE-Proton you can use <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, which I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">a previous tutorial on</a>. No doubt an official Proton update will come to help but this will get you going right now.</p>
<p>Once you have ProtonUp-Qt and then use it to download GE-Proton, set the game to use GE-Proton in the Compatibility menu in the Properties (restart Steam for it to show up). On Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you will need to add this as a launch option otherwise while the videos play they don't look right at all:</p>
<p><code>WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do the launch option, it's in the Properties menu of your game on Steam. On Desktop simply right click -&gt; Properties and then enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck. Pick the game in your Library, go to the Cog icon on the right and go to Properties and enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An extra fix needed for the <u>Steam Deck</u> specifically, is to have the launcher close when you hit play. Otherwise you just get a black screen! Find the "Launcher.exe.config" file in your installed folder, open it with a text editor and line 76 will have this:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="false"</code></p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="true"</code></p>
<p>Now it will work properly on Steam Deck too. Another case of a random launcher being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.</li>
<li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.</li>
<li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.</li>
<li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs. Lots of Bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game, so far it seems reasonably good. I love the attempt to capture to cheesiness from the original movie. We don't talk about the two sequels.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get punched with nostalgia and eat some pizza? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is officially out now along with Native Linux support and it's looking good on desktop and a Steam Deck too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge features groundbreaking gameplay rooted in timeless classic brawling mechanics, brought to you by the beat ’em up experts at Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4) and Tribute Games. Bash your way through gorgeous pixel art environments and slay tons of hellacious enemies with your favorite Turtle, each with his own skills and moves - making each run unique! Choose a fighter, use radical combos to defeat your opponents and experience intense combats loaded with breathtaking action and outrageous ninja abilities. Stay sharp as you face off against Shredder and his faithful Foot Clan alone, or grab your best buds and play with up to 6 players simultaneously!"</p>
<p>This is basically a massive homage to classic beat 'em ups, TMNT, old cartoons and retro gaming all in one and I firmly welcome it. It's absolutely gorgeous but wow it will make your thumbs ache. That intro video as well, wow, what memories from my childhood! Launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozKsDzumb0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d95df53e619596267131012c5405d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozKsDzumb0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic 80s inspired retro Turtles brawling action on modern platforms </li>
<li>Six player local &amp; online co-op, featuring April O’Neil and Casey Jones’ playable debut in a TMNT beat-em-up</li>
<li>Attributes, moves and animations tailored to each fighter, channeling their personality and granting a unique edge in battle</li>
<li>Gorgeous pixel renders of signature locales like Dimension X, Coney Island and more</li>
<li>Absolutely bangin’ OST composed by Tee Lopes featuring cultural icons Ghostface Killah and Raekwon</li>
<li>Expertly crafted platform brawler gameplay from the teams who brought you <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> and <em>Panzer Paladin</em></li>
<li>Bodacious replayability from the challenge to master all seven characters with gameplay that makes each run feel totally radical</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's a beat 'em up, there's quite a lot of moves to learn. As you first get into the game, there's 21 animated in-game slides of various moves to learn. Naturally you can't be expected to learn them all right away but a good bit of button-bashing is often all your need to make your way through and enjoy these types of games. Thankfully, you can access to move list from the pause menu at any point.</p>

      <title>The Frogs will take you through a humorous renaissance artwork adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making use of public domain renaissance artwork, The Frogs is an upcoming comedy point and click adventure. A demo is available and now they're on Kickstarter. Very similar in style to what was done with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/the-procession-to-calvary-is-a-brilliantly-funny-adventure-of-renaissance-paintings-stitched-together" target="_blank">The Procession to Calvary</a> (different developer), and actually inspired by it. More of this sounds great because it's such a unique way to make a game.</p>
<p>"Join Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, ecstasy, and (most importantly) theater on a journey to Athens and subsequently the underworld in a comedic romp that pays homage to Aristophanes and his brilliant work, The Frogs! Over 15 hours of snark, satire and absurdity await as Dionysus must solve puzzles, convince people that he is a fun drunk and not just annoying, and find a replacement for the horrible poets and playwrights that are plaguing his festivals."</p>

<p>Just recently it went live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1792467505/the-frogs" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, where they have 58 days to hit $8,500 in funding.</p>
<p>What the developer says it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative Point-and-Click Interface</li>
<li>Ancient Humor Circa 405 BCE</li>
<li>Choices That Matter</li>
<li>Multiple Solutions to Puzzles</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork</li>
<li>Classical Music</li>
<li>Hidden Optional Content</li>
<li>Tons Of Interactive Elements and NPCs</li>
<li>References So Niche You'll Wonder Why I Bothered</li>
<li>Multiple Endings Whether Aristophanes Likes It Or Not</li>
<li>What's He Gonna Do? Come Back From the Dead and Get Me?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III released for Linux with a port from Feral</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is the latest Native Linux game to officially land, with Feral Interactive once again delivering. The Linux version has the latest 1.2 update along with the hotfix from late in May.</p>
<p>WARHAMMER III plunges players into a cataclysmic power struggle between mortals and daemons with each aiming to save or exploit the power of a dying god. Featuring seven diverse playable races - including the video-game debuts of Grand Cathay and Kislev - alongside ground-breaking new features such as the Realm of Chaos campaign, eight-player multiplayer, and the customisable RPG-like Daemon Prince Legendary Lord.</p>
<p>Currently though, it seems to be the lowest rated in the series, with even Total War: WARHAMMER II regularly seeing double the amount of players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="senV4ZCKm4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c79920b934e7a6ad20ce08a66bc631e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/senV4ZCKm4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sadly, it's <em>another</em> port from Feral that has multiplayer locked per operating system. We repeatedly asked them to clarify it before release but they wouldn't say. Today at release they confirmed via <a href="https://twitter.com/feralgames/status/1537443725478985728" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our version of the game allows online multiplayer between players on the same Operating System only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you play the Linux port from Feral, you can <em>only</em> play other Linux port players. So if you want to play friends on Windows, you will still need to use the Proton compatibility layer to run the Windows version. A pretty big sore spot for a Linux port in 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Their new Linux and macOS trailer is below:</p>

      <title>The last ever game from Zachtronics releases July 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No doubt plenty of puzzle fans will be sad, as Zachtronics will be hanging up their development hat and moving on after the release of Last Call BBS. Entering Early Access on July 5th, it's technically multiple games in one.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<p>This isn't some marketing gimmick either, Zach has taken up a teaching job and really is moving on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Early Access will only last a couple of month to get any issues ironed-out and perhaps another mini-game before it's finally time to move on.</p>

      <title>LightSpeed Studios (Tencent) joins the Open 3D Foundation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LightSpeed Studios, owned by Tencent, has joined up with the Open 3D Foundation who oversee the <a href="https://www.o3de.org/" target="_blank">Open 3D Engine (O3DE)</a>. They've joined as a Premier Member joining the likes of Adobe, Epic Games, Microsoft, Intel and others. This means they will be giving resources to the Open 3D Foundation to further development of the Open 3D Engine.</p>
<p>On top of that though and I'm sure this will raise some eyebrows, Tencent Senior Project Manager, Lanye Wang, will join the Open 3D Foundation's Governing Board.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are very excited to join the Open 3D Foundation, especially for the opportunity to leverage the connection with all of the other members to dive deep into the graphic technologies and build a top-level open source 3D engine community,” said Lanye Wang, representing LightSpeed Studios. “We look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“It has been amazing to see the rapid growth of the O3D ecosystem, and we’re elated to welcome LightSpeed Studios to our community,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director of Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. “LightSpeed Studios has achieved a strong reputation as a leading global game developer, offering high-quality gaming experiences to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, and we are excited to collaborate with them as we enhance O3DE’s capabilities for global 3D developers.”</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher has a bug fix release AND a huge new overhaul Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two goodies for fans of the open source Heroic Games Launcher today. Those sticking with the stable release get some fixes, and those who want some fun can try out a huge new Beta.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.9" target="_blank">v2.3.9</a> stable release the developers added in some fixes for GOG games that use DOSBox and ScummVM, further increasing the compatibility as Heroic will properly handle the configuration files for them now. Always great to see!</p>
<p>Heroic <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta" target="_blank">v2.4.0</a> Beta is where the fun begins. This is a huge change to how the app looks and works. The biggest changes include a new collapsible sidebar that stays open so you get access to many quick-functions like accessing your library, store pages, settings, the wine manager, download list and download status and more. It's actually really useful and makes Heroic feel a lot better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You will also notice that the library is now unified into one list, although you can filter it per-store. Game cards will also now always show the game title and buttons for play, settings and updating.</p>
<p>Plenty of other changes like an option to change the game language if supported, a fix for GOG games using DOSBox and ScummVM (just like the stable release) and much more.</p>
<p>You can still swap it to a list if you prefer it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What do you think to the changes?</p>

      <title>Build cities on the back of a giant animal in The Wandering Village — coming to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, a city-builder set on the back of a giant animal is now confirmed to be having Native Linux support at the Early Access release. Created by Stray Fawn Studio, the same team behind Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor, Retimed and Niche - a genetics survival game.</p>
<p>"In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call 'Onbu'. Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you."</p>
<p>They don't have a really up to date trailer, with their Xbox reveal being their newest:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Cgs-WWqadM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5f915e05e99d7e3cee7fed82e27713f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Cgs-WWqadM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I spoke to the developer some time ago and they weren't sure if they were doing Linux support or not. Their plans have changed, with confirmation to me via email that it will have full Linux support including at Early Access. A Linux build is already their for their Closed Beta and they continue improving it.</p>
<p>For players interested on Steam Deck, they do have plans for gamepad / controller support on PC / Linux but that will come later in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Wilderness survival sandbox Vintage Story has a massive upgrade out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I really haven't spent enough time with because it's great, Vintage Story is a blocky survival game that's thoroughly challenging and a huge upgrade is out now. Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's definitely one of the more unique open-world survival games around.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/de-jank-and-game-juice-update-1170-pre1-r322/" target="_blank">Version 1.17.0</a> is now in testing, so it's not fully released, and comes with absolutely tons that's new. A big tech overhaul too that should improve RAM use, starting a world should be twice as fast, multiple improvements to overall performance and improvements to creature AI too. Heck, there's even a fancy new water system that allows water to flow through most blocks that aren't solid.</p>
<p>New trailer is below and it's seriously impressive:</p>

<p>Other new additions include lightning strikes, 200+ new blocks, big visual upgrades to the temporal storms that happen, armour can now be repaired, 300 types of shield (a 30-fold increase), more and prettier flora, new and improved fauna like the addition of brown bears, black bears, sun bears, pandas and a gazelle, deserts storms are in, bamboo and straw hats and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Vintage Story doesn't get enough credit for being such a thoroughly interesting and massive game.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/vintage-story?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and the <a href="http://www.vintagestory.at/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Mixing action-adventure and tower defense, Dwerve is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwerve is a bit of an odd one, blending together elements of a dungeon-crawling action adventure with tower defense and it's out now. Created by Half Human Games, they previously made the space shooter Blacksea Odyssey. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>"Dwerve is a tower defense dungeon crawler RPG where you play as a young dwarf tinkerer who adventures into a ruined kingdom and unearths the lost technologies of the ancient warsmiths: turrets and traps. These are the only weapons that can protect the dwarves from Witch-Queen Vandra and her army of bloodthirsty trolls and monstrous creatures hellbent on conquering the surface."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="02WPEagu_Yc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/17b4e8e9dcd2fd51c8919fb1beb6dfc1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/02WPEagu_Yc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A concept that isn't original (what is now?), with other games doing this mix too like Sanctum. However this is not a 3D shooter mix, instead giving you some pretty wonderful pixel-art. It blends together story-based adventuring, with real-time battles where you place down various towers wherever you want and watch as the action happens. Since you're a living character in this, you will be constantly running around.</p>
<p>Unlike more traditional tower defense games, towers and traps have a limit amount of health, so you will be repeatedly running back and forth between towers to pull them down when they're about done (or destroyed) to put them back up and continue your defence.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, plenty of it was a bit <em>too</em> slow when I initially played it and the developer has received a lot of feedback on this, to the point that they've released some patches to make it feel a little faster. Simple things like movement speed being too slow, which has been buffed up and the result is a slightly smoother feeling game now that I feel is easily worth a go if you want a slightly different take on tower defense.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once it really gets going, it can be surprisingly challenging too. Not only are you watching your tower health closely, but you also need to take into account the different enemy types too (some towers can't hit certain enemies) and once your towers are down — they will come for you. So it can be a little frantic to reposition your towers and get to safety. In a way, the battles feel a little like a 2D version of Orcs Must Die! somewhat.</p>
<p>I love the way it uses the area you're adventuring through in the story for the battling too. No special stages, no changing levels, you just keep exploring and place down towers whenever needed. Overall it's a pretty fun take on a mix of genres.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Tower defense combat!</strong> Build turrets and traps to fend off swarms of monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Dungeon crawling!</strong> Explore a ruined kingdom brimming with hidden secrets and puzzles!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Upgrade your turrets and traps!</strong> Each has its own upgrade tree with 100+ upgrades in all!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Fight epic boss battles!</strong> Use strategy, wit, and fast reflexes to out maneuver massive monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Discover powerful artifacts!</strong> Dragonfire Boots, Lionheart Shield, Gurrakk's Hammer, and more!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Embark on an adventure!</strong> Meet friends, travel throughout the mountain, stop the Witch-Queen!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my playthrough, the Native Linux version worked great, no obvious issues and controller support worked fine too with my current-gen Xbox pad.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dwerve?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1132760/Dwerve/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>BeamNG.drive gets experimental Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the new 0.25 release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/284160/BeamNGdrive/" target="_blank">BeamNG.drive</a>, the developers have now put up an experimental Native Linux version for you to try and give feedback.</p>
<p>What is it? BeamNG.drive is a driving sim based on realism. They have spent a long time on their sim, along with their soft-body physics engine simulating all parts of their vehicles in real-time that they say results in "true-to-life behavior". It's a huge game on Steam, with an Overwhelmingly Positive review score from over 100,000 users.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/news/announce/experimental-linux-support/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the release of 0.25 we are including <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> support for BeamNG Linux. We know that this is something a number of you have wanted for some time, and it seems the time has come to give our players the chance to experiment with this.</p>
<p>Since this is an experimental work in progress product, we do not offer customer support for BeamNG on Linux. This product may be buggy, crashy, unstable or all of the above, but if you are a Linux enthusiast we encourage you to try it out.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us get a properly supported version of BeamNG for Linux. In case of questions, <a href="https://www.beamng.com/threads/86422/" target="_blank">please make use of this thread</a>, but make sure to read the guidelines first.</p>

      <title>Check out Striving for Light if you love endless character-building skill trees</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Striving for Light is a new Native Linux release from Igniting Spark Games, one to check out for ARPG fans who love building up crazy characters.</p>
<p>One of the unique selling points on this one is that the skill tree is ever-expanding, allowing you to just keep on going and they say it's actually "infinite". Not just that, the visuals are certainly on the different side for such an action-RPG with them all being hand-drawn and it doesn't really look like any other I've played.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T39yA5Bwhxc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49f0b5c825c00f12ff13043d63a64c23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T39yA5Bwhxc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems to work quite well on the Steam Deck too, although the dialog text size when chatting to NPCs is a little on the small side. Apart from that it seems to run just fine and great on desktop Linux too. With it being in Early Access it's not quite finished yet, with a good few months still go for the initial year they suggested it would be there.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dive into a dark, mysterious world full of dangers</li>
<li>Everything is hand drawn</li>
<li>Explore a big variety of random generated maps</li>
<li>Unique soundtracks for each environment</li>
<li>Level up and utilise a unique random generated and infinite expanding skill tree</li>
<li>Unlock new skills and weapons</li>
<li>Endless progression system</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1646790/Striving_for_Light/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> with a demo.</p>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles gets a bit of a makeover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the fantastic and fast-moving free and open source application for managing the Wine compatibility layer has a new release out with a new code-name and a refreshed look. It's such a big release internally, they're now calling the releases by Brescia instead of Trento. So, what's new? A lot, as usual.</p>
<p>The backend has been bumped up to GTK4 + libadwaita, which has resulted in some tweaks to the styling along with overall performance improvements with it using more modern toolkits. Along with this, the onboarding experience was changed to look a bit fancier:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some other tweaks include changes to the Bottle screen with a reorganised utilities list, with the most-used items easier to access. A few others have been put under a Legacy menu together, which contains various Wine tools they haven't implemented directly into Bottles just yet. Some performance upgrades have been done for the way the Programs, Dependencies, Versioning and Installers screens are populated to reduce loading time too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png"/></a>Image Credit - Bottles team</em></p>
<p>Launch options were improved too, which now allow you to override some preferences from the Bottle. Which in some cases may allow you to avoid creating a whole new Bottle when one app inside needs a specific option (useful!).</p>
<p>A new notification system has been added, to alert you to what the application is doing to keep you informed. Loads more like high-resolution application icons, listing games installed via launchers like Steam in Wine and eventually other launchers too like Origin and Battle.net, an option to disable mouse acceleration, they added 14 new Windows dependencies plus various fixes.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.25 is out now, here&#39;s some of what&#39;s new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get the latest and greatest from the KDE team? The awesome <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.25</a> release is officially out now. This is the desktop environment used on the Steam Deck when in Desktop Mode! Hopefully Valve will update it at some point.</p>
<p>One of the big new additions is the extension of what you can customize. Accent colours for example, can be automatically picked based on your background making everything fit nicely together. It's optional of course, you can set the colouring however you like. You can also now have floating panels, that will gracefully stop floating when you maximise a window and it looks pretty slick.</p>
<p>Switching between windows and workspaces is now a breeze, thanks to the new Overview affect that's shipped. This gives you a good look at everything you have open, allowing you to also search through apps, documents, and browser tabs with KRunner and the Application Launcher.</p>
<p>There's also masses of upgrades and new additions to touchscreen input and gestures on a touchpad. Oh, and the Discover Software app had the application pages redesigned to give you access to more and better info on what you're downloading and plenty of upgrades to their Flatpak handling.</p>
<p>See their flashy release trailer below:</p>

<p>There's also absolutely loads (hundreds!) of improvements and fixes for Wayland support too.</p>

      <title>Turbo Golf Racing could be the next multiplayer hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo currently available in Steam Next Fest, the racer game Turbo Golf Racing is one to watch. Tested on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 7.</p>
<p>You can be in a match with up to eight players and you can go solo, or create a party. The idea is simple, from go you power as fast as you can into your personal ball and keep smashing your car into it until you get it into the hole at the end of the course. While racing, there's various power-ups you can collect and areas of the track that can give you a boost too.</p>
<p>Here's some footage of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AOdzgBXq4rM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b42cb46f7b42e9cdc948b0896b7eb294.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AOdzgBXq4rM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit does concern me though with Power Cores, special additions to your vehicle that can enable you to have an abilities boost that could create some messy balancing.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely hooked on this already though and I think if they do it right, this could easily be the next big multiplayer experience. Nice to see it working so well with Proton even before release too! It will not be free to play though, so it will be interesting to see how it does.</p>
<p>The developers say it will have free regular upgrades with new courses, cosmetics and more.</p>
<p>Try it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324350/Turbo_Golf_Racing/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It enters Early Access on August 4th.</p>

      <title>Monster collecting game Cassette Beasts shows off the powerful fusion system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an incredibly exciting looking upcoming monster collecting game, one that will offer a rather unique take on the genre and a new trailer is up showcasing the fusion system.</p>
<p>It's on the unique side, since you're not collecting these creatures or using them in a traditional way. Instead of throwing them out of some kind of ball, you turn into them. The fusion system is where it gets real interesting though, allowing you to combine two forms into something unique. The developers say it will be able to generate "over fourteen thousand unique fusions that will allow you as a player to fully customize your team to fit your unique style".</p>
<p>During the Guerrilla Collective digital games showcase a new trailer was shown below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H_TebiMOPvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a416fe4f64476fded9c0358cd918d393.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H_TebiMOPvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it will have a Native Linux build at release.</p>
<p>You can wishlist / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>20 Minutes Till Dawn is like Vampire Survivors with guns — goodbye free time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>20 Minutes Till Dawn is what you get when you take the basic action-survival idea that Vampire Survivors made popular again, makes it really dark and puts a gun in your hand. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>I am thoroughly loving this return to simple, cheap and engrossing experiences that we've had recently. It's only £2.09 on Steam and you can get a ridiculous amount of time out of it and it's only going to get bigger since it's in Early Access right now. 20 Minutes Till Dawn is a rogue-lite survival action game, where you run around defeating an increasing number of weird creatures and collect little pips that drop when they die to level up. When you level up, you get to pick from a random list of upgrades to create a ridiculous character.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, it works out of the box perfectly on Linux desktops, and with a Steam Input adjustment it can feel great on the Steam Deck too. Here's a look at it on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogCLZ9MfF-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42892aae2a84dbd24a31965df092fb8f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogCLZ9MfF-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just guns though, there's a few different characters to unlock and they each have different weapons to unlock too as there's plenty of persistent progression to keep you going.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 50 different upgrades too choose from for a unique experience every run!</li>
<li>Wide cast of characters, with more to come post-launch.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-20 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
<li>Rune System helps you become stronger</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think and hope they add some visual aids for people with poor eyesight though, because I can imagine it being a little difficult to see. That's part of the fun for me though, and certainly makes it on the tougher side to play through and keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>Right now, I think it's instantly become my new favourite game to blast through when taking a break.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You're an android who awakens in a ruined future, this is Kandria. A new upcoming 2D hack and slash open world action RPG.

<p>I spoke with the developer today who confirmed that not only will it have Native Linux support, they also mentioned that they "develop primarily on Linux, so it'll stay supported". Another fun point, is that they plan to open source their code for their in-house game engine.</p>
<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore over 2'100x1'200m of gameplay area</li>
<li>Beat 250 individual, hand-crafted rooms</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try out a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> right now for Next Fest and support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. The crowdfunding campaign has 29 days to hit at least 10,000CHF (Swiss franc), so it's about £8,246.</p>

      <title>Arctic Awakening is an upcoming cold narrative-adventure mystery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an initial setting that seems a little like The Long Dark, the upcoming Arctic Awakening seems like a thoroughly interesting story-focused exploration adventure. Shown off during the Future Games Show summer showcase, the developer confirmed to me today their plans to have it release with a Native Linux build.</p>
<p>"You are Kai, a pilot without a plane lost in the wilderness of the far north. You’ll need your wits about you to brave the elements, find your co-pilot and get the hell out of Dodge. Along the way, you might just discover what it was that cut your plane clean in two... and what it is making those noises after dark.</p>
<p>Arctic Awakening is a first-person narrative adventure set in the mysterious Arctic North where you and your robotic companion, Alfie, must search for your co-pilot... and a way home."</p>

      <title>AMD announce Radeon Memory Visualizer support for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD <a href="https://gpuopen.com/radeon-memory-visualizer-on-linux/" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday that they're now supporting the Radeon Memory Visualizer on Linux, as a result of "the rising popularity of gaming on the Linux OS".</p>
<p>This is a tool to help game developers solve some complex issues and analyze video memory usage on AMD Radeon GPUs. A good step, as it's not just enough to have games working well on Linux, we also need to pull in more game developers so we can eventually have great direct-support.</p>
<p>Starting with the June 2022 release of their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/tools/" target="_blank">Radeon Developer Tool Suite</a>, developers can analyze Vulkan applications on Linux. Officially, they're supporting Ubuntu 20.04 but other distributions will likely also work but may need some different dependencies installed. AMD say the experience is largely the same as the Windows version too.</p>

<p>Not only do you get to try some games, Valve has also added special badges you can earn during the event for playing various demos. So if you love collecting things on Steam for your profile, it's a nice bit of added fluff to get you to play more.</p>
<p>Since I've been excited for this one, here's some Linux gameplay from the FPS game Selaco:</p>

      <title>Initial thoughts on the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HP and System76 teamed up for the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a>, and for a little while now I’ve been using it as my main machine for everything possible for GamingOnLinux related and otherwise. Here's my initial thoughts, with more to come when I've had more time.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: this was a review unit sent directly by HP. I’ll preface this with a clear note, that initially I was offered a payment to review it. I denied the offer, since I <em>never</em> take payments for reviews and was later told it was a mistake by the PR firm involved. System76 has since said I can <em>keep</em> the device but that does not affect my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Available for $1,099, you can have it with the System76 Launch Configurable Keyboard (which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">reviewed previously</a>) and a HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse as optional <em>extras</em>. Not only is the hardware a thing of beauty but the operating system is pretty slick too, as it comes with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> from System76. This was also my first <em>real</em> test of Pop!_OS for more than just messing around for an hour and it’s really easy to get along with.</p>
<p>Built for "developers", which is a pretty ambiguous way to describe who it’s really for, it’s actually a pretty solid all-rounder that just glides through most of what you can throw at it. Except playing the latest games at 1080p, although it does quite well at lower resolutions. It’s a powerhouse when it comes to the CPU but not the GPU.</p>
<p><strong>Main Specifications</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4924067471655137414gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20619634371655460609gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20619634371655460609gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18599703941655460610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18599703941655460610gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since this is an AMD unit, which is still quite rare with Linux vendors, it does mean you get open source drivers with it too so that's a nice bonus for Linux and FOSS enthusiasts. This is also not a case of a rebrand for Linux, this was a Linux-first endeavour and you can feel it and see it all the way through.</p>
<p>Is it really a Linux hardware review if you don’t Neofetch it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3175648691655130029gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It ships with a pretty standard proprietary firmware / BIOS. Coreboot was being evaluated but they simply didn't have time to get it onto it ready for production. The good news though is that it fully supports the <a href="https://fwupd.org/" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>, so you can easily get updates directly on the machine without ever needing Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2316521241655134138gol1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>System76 and HP together?</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most surprising part of the laptop and quite an important one to think on. Since System76 are a hardware vendor with their own laptops (and lots more), on top of making the Pop!_OS distribution, it's a great way for both System76 and HP to expand who is using Linux to the benefit of them both in the long run. Fantastic for us consumers too, as more choice for Linux is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the experience here with Pop!_OS is great too, especially as they haven't filled it full of fluff. It's largely a generic standard Pop install because it has such a wide target for Linux enthusiasts. A few of the tweaks include a different wallpaper by default and their own special selection to pick from, an EULA to accept on install and opt-in analytics for HP to get info to improve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/846734461655131342gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Access to software out of the box is great, with the Pop!_Shop software centre having both the standard repositories and <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> enabled together so the amount of extras you have access to should enable you to find anything you could possibly need and Flathub is growing all the time.</p>
<p>There are some things that makes it "special" according to HP like an integrated support panel within the OS, HP have specially trained their support teams for the device and HP also do a full QA certification for every kernel and firmware update for it. Safe to say they're making sure people who buy it are well supported. They even collaborated with AMD on suspend/resume support.</p>
<p><strong>The Dev One experience</strong></p>
<p>The screen, wow, where do I start? It’s glossy, so it has a few reflections in certain lighting conditions but apart from that, it’s absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>. The brightness is actually seriously impressive, somewhat blinding at max setting even. I’ve spent almost my entire time with it at 50% brightness but could easily go lower, it’s just that clear. Pretty great viewing angles from each edge too, I don’t think anyone is going to have any issues with the screen for sure.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise initially was the audio from the speakers. Not only is it crystal clear, it’s also incredibly loud. At 50% audio level, I could hear it pretty clearly in another room across my house so that’s pretty great. Putting it up to 100% audio level was really where the audio truly impressed me though, it still remained impeccably clear which is kind of ridiculous for its size.</p>
<p>How is the fan? When really pushing the device, I was amazed at how quiet the fan remained. It’s not silent by any measure but it is quiet, you only really hear a gentle muted blow out of it that puts to shame some other devices I have (including my own personal laptop). Fan noise can be stupidly distracting but here it was easy to tune it out completely. I fully expected to hear it start ramping-up when I pushed it to the limit but it remained quiet which I was genuinely astonished by.</p>
<p>A great keyboard too, and it even includes a trackpoint (otherwise known as a nipple) for those of you who loved that on the ThinkPads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009311121655132659gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm glad they chose a muted colour for the nipple though, so it doesn't overly stick-out against the the unit. Fits in quite well as a fun extra for those who like using one.</p>
<p>The keyboard as a whole feels great to use. It's quiet, which seems to be a nice theme with this unit so you won't have distracting clicks while you're working away, same goes for the built-in mouse buttons which are very quiet although the touchpad can be clicked in too but that's quite a nice muted sound. From what they say it's spill-resistant, although I don't dare to test that. The keyboard is backlit too, which has a few levels of brightness as well as having the backlight off so you can work under different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>A nice privacy feature they have, which took me a while to even notice, is that you can slide a privacy screen over the webcam. I absolutely love that and I honestly think every laptop should have this. Directly above the webcam is a tiny slider that you just pull across.</p>
<p>This is probably the nicest laptop I’ve ever used. Not something I say lightly either, practically everything about it feels <em>just right</em>. I would have vastly preferred a matt screen but that is about the only issue I’ve personally had with it. Due to the screen, working outside with it is not really possible. Shot below is in the shade on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And then sat in the sun on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Yeah, you're not going to be working outside with this at all. Again though, that is about my only complaint with it and I never work outside anyway. However, think an anti-glare matt screen will do much better anyway? It won't do a whole lot of good outside that's for sure but does look better inside — as long as it's not pointing at a light. For comparison here's it up against the Asus VivoBook S510U inside and then outside:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I have to hand it to HP and System76 here, together they’ve managed to craft a truly great machine to work with. An impressive device overall when thinking about every angle of it.</p>
<p>No problems encountered with anything either. WiFi worked exceptionally well even when pushing it hard with downloads and streaming together, with it maxing out at 167 Mbps download and 26 Mbps upload with my Google Mesh WiFi which is actually great — more than enough for the vast majority of uses.</p>
<p>Also, another small but very welcome tweak is that the Power button has is tougher to push down so there’s less of a chance of hitting it accidentally. I hope more hardware vendors do this.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, it's pretty great actually. When you really push it, you're not looking at more than 2-3 hours but this is a developer-focused machine so coding with music playing, you're looking at nearly a full day of battery life but of course that also depends on things light screen brightness, audio levels, bluetooth on and more. Battery testing is always a tough one because people use such devices very differently. I'm impressed with it though and it's been more than enough to get lots done without needing a charge. Charging is pretty quick too, with it able to get up to at least 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently it’s U.S. only but it sounds like they might have plans for expanding shipping in future, which was mentioned during a Q&amp;A session but no ETA.</p>
<p>While doing the review I also used the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/products/hp-935-creator-wireless-mouse" target="_blank">HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse</a> they supplied as my main mouse too, and found that to be a truly comfortable experience as well. It’s really light, and has a perfect shape to nicely fit my hand. Seems HP keeps impressing me. The battery life on that has a claim of 12 weeks and so far it hasn't needed charging. As a great extra, they also built a Mouse Configurator (that's <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/mouse-configurator" target="_blank">open source</a>) just for using it with the Dev One.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13962661691655134588gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some good attention to <em>all</em> the details here.</p>
<p>Right now, I can see absolutely no reason not to recommend it if you're in the market for a laptop around the $1,099 price-point as not many will be able to match the quality for that.</p>
<p>If you’re after a really wonderful laptop that comes with Linux, the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> is an absolutely brilliant unit that shines and I'll have more to say after spending a while longer with it. If I'm not at my desk, this is my go-to laptop now.</p>
<p>To readers: what would you love to see tested on it? Do let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Techland ends support for Dying Light, 7 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are moving on from the original Dying Light, after giving it 7 years of free updates and expansions. Not many developers support their games for that long, if they're not some sort of live-service thing. Techland certainly did well overall with it.</p>
<p>While it won't see any major updates now, they will still be trickling in a steady "reroll" of previous events into the game for people to play but their main focus is now shifting over to Dying Light 2.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UrneVfMZt30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cea514b760eec6a7462aa8e2cdf4031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UrneVfMZt30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Dying Light also now only has two editions, to make it less confusing. There's Dying Light Enhanced Edition and the new Dying Light Definitive Edition, both of them on a heavy discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>To go along with it, the Harran Tactical Unit Bundle DLC has been made free to claim for two weeks. People who owned the Platinum Edition were also upgraded to the Definitive Edition free. This is after they also gave away The Following expansion to all previous owners.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake gets a brand new flashy trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming System Shock from Nightdive Studios is still coming, and a brand new trailer was recently shown off during the PC Gaming Show 2022. We don't know when it will release though.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1994, this remake was crowdfunded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and it hasn't been without trouble with development at one point being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/development-on-the-new-system-shock-has-been-paused/" target="_blank">paused</a> but it seems they're close to the finishing line now. Linux support for it was a stretch-goal at $1.1 million USD that was hit, so hopefully they will come through with a good version of it.</p>
<p>You can see the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Microphone noise suppression app NoiseTorch returns with a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch" target="_blank">NoiseTorch</a>, a popular real-time microphone noise suppression app recently had a possible <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/developer-of-popular-noise-suppression-tool-noisetorch-has-dev-machine-compromised/" target="_blank">security issue</a> but it's been reviewed thoroughly and it's back.</p>
<p>"NoiseTorch is an easy to use open source application for Linux with PulseAudio or PipeWire. It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise, in any application. Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the NoiseTorch Virtual Microphone as input to torch the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes."</p>
<p>In the new version 0.12.0 they completed a review of the code, and no issue was found. To help against any future issues, they're no longer using a separate update server and instead they will be using GitHub releases so it's all more transparent. For added security, they're also now using more GitHub features to validate the code too.</p>
<p>On top of that the new release also has some code cleanups, and the actual filtering status will be clearer now so it should give a better user experience.</p>

<p>Usagi Shima, from developer pank0 (aka Jess Yu), is an upcoming idle bunny collecting game I've been following for quite some time and the first-ever short gameplay trailer just went up. Shown off as part of the recent Wholesome Direct 2022, it's nice to finally see more than screenshots and tiny gifs on their popular <a href="https://twitter.com/_pank0" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>"You’ve been tasked as caretaker of an abandoned island — as you decorate it over time, curious (but adorable!) bunny visitors start to appear! Buy toys, plants, and build structures on an abandoned island to entice curious bun tourists to pay your island a visit. Discover, take photos, and make friends with a variety of bunnies that visit based on how you’ve decorated and arranged the island."</p>

<p>Some of what it will feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover and record 30+ rabbits with unique looks and features!</li>
<li>Over 100 items to decorate with, some even interactive!</li>
<li>Hand-drawn and traditionally animated art style</li>
<li>Pet and engage with a variety of activities with the bunnies to build friendship</li>
<li>Receive keepsakes from bunnies you’ve become best friends with, and even invite them to stay on your island.</li>
<li>Synced with real time, experience the island ambience matching your time of day</li>
<li>Relaxing idle gameplay – no time limits, no stress, enjoy the ambience and play at your own pace!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Playing OXOGO could land you a big real-life prize that increases with its sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of OXOGO are hoping to entice some people to play their retro-styled adventure, with the added excitement of the possibility to earn a real-life prize.</p>
<p>OXOGO is an adventure styled like games from early 90s handheld consoles, so it would fit right in on the Game Boy. In OXOGO your dog has been kidnapped, and you end up in some sort of prison. An adventure about finding your dog but also a real treasure hunt at the same time. The developer is putting a small amount of each sale into a pot, to give away to whoever can put together all the clues to find a password.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bu-9cORkWHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9acd1b7b45343aa73d6addb0a75a95f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bu-9cORkWHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If no one claims the prize by December 2025, any of the <em>extra</em> (not the whole thing) they added to the initial pot will be donated to free software development projects.</p>
<p>The pot started at €5,000 and they said they will update their <a href="http://oxogo.info/" target="_blank">website</a> once a month for how it's doing.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://oxogo.itch.io/oxogo" target="_blank">buy on itch.io</a> as pay-what-you-want and get treasure hunting.</p>

      <title>Phasmophobia gets new Voice Recognition to work on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been itching to play Phasmophobia? Well, you no longer have to wait for Wine and Proton to be upgraded as the developers have ripped out the Windows-specific stuff.</p>
<p>In their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3339995286952592740" target="_blank">update notes</a>, they mentioned how they "are no longer relying on Windows' speech systems, meaning it supports many more languages and platforms, such as ‘GeForce Now’ and Steam Deck, with no setup required (and fixes that pesky tab-out bug)."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phasmophobia is a 4 player online co-op psychological horror where you and your team members of paranormal investigators will enter haunted locations filled with paranormal activity and gather as much evidence of the paranormal as you can. You will use your ghost hunting equipment to search for and record evidence of whatever ghost is haunting the location to sell onto a ghost removal team.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to support your team by monitoring the location with CCTV cameras and motion sensors from the safety of the truck or head inside and get your hands dirty with the ghostly activity that will get increasingly hostile as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should hopefully bump the game up on Steam Deck from Unsupported to Verified.</p>

      <title>AMD tease roadmap for Zen 4, Zen 5, RDNA 3 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the recent Financial Analyst Day, AMD revealed a little bit more about their upcoming roadmap and there's plenty to be excited about for their next-gen CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>Some of the points that were mentioned for desktop and laptop users, those were interested in here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen 4 CPUs later this year as the "world's first" 5nm x86 CPUs. AMD say it will give an IPC uplift of 8-10% and more than a 25% increase in performance-per-watt and a 35% overall performance increase compared to Zen 3 when running desktop applications. We can also expect Zen 4 with V-Cache, and a Zen 4c revision and some will be on a 4nm process.</li>
<li>Zen 5 "Granite Ridge" CPUs planned for 2024, which is being built from the ground-up. Zen 5 will have both 4nm and 3nm designs.</li>
<li>AMD RDNA 3 "Navi 3x" will bring a chiplet design, which will also have their Infinity Cache tech with a 5nm process which they claim a 50% boost in performance-per-watt compared with the previous generation. AMD said to expect Navi 3x GPUs later this year.</li>
<li>A new "Phoenix Point" mobile processor coming in 2023, which will have Zen 4 along with RDNA graphics followed up by the "Strix Point" processor in 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the Steam Deck got a passing mention, with AMD patting themselves on the back for their position amongst the main consoles since they power the Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have plenty more coming with the Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced, although there's no date yet they've teased it.</p>
<p>In By Blood Alone you chart the course of Mussolini's regime in Italy <em>or</em> subvert Italy's historical path in one of many new alt-historical paths in the new Italian focus tree, driven by the constant involvement in war from the beginning to the end of the game. This includes a new expansive focus tree for Ethiopia and one for Switzerland too. Plus you get to design your own planes which sounds thoroughly interesting.</p>
<p>As always, it will also release alongside a fresh free upgrade for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="owqpUZy6Gbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91c4f87ece0b50c61bc918513a009572.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/owqpUZy6Gbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Italian Focus Tree: Follow the historical path of Mussolini’s Italy or rewrite history by restoring power to the monarchy, leading a Communist revolution or promoting democracy.</li>
<li>New Ethiopian Focus Tree: Defy the odds to defeat the Italian invader or resist the conqueror from abroad using unique Government in Exile abilities.</li>
<li>New Swiss Focus Tree: Surrounded by France, Germany and Italy, the mountain nation of Switzerland finds strength in its neutrality, balancing competing factions and overtures from the great powers.</li>
<li>New Peace Conference Options: Demilitarize zones of the map or entire nations, bid on the capital ships of defeated powers, or claim control of enemy resources or factories as reparations.</li>
<li>Aircraft Designer: Design and build your own planes, from nimble interceptors that prioritize speed to durable bombers crafted to unload tons of destruction from high above.</li>
<li>Unit Medals: A log of each division’s accomplishments lets you track their performance, and even allow you to award medals to those that have performed well.</li>
<li>Embargo Interaction: Embargo your enemies with a new diplomatic interaction, preventing them from trading with you if they have generated enough world tension.</li>
<li>New Unit Models: More than 20 new pieces of unit art for Italian, Ethiopian and Swiss armies.</li>
<li>New Plane Models: 67 new plane models.</li>
<li>12 New Music Tracks</li>
</ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get Steam Deck and Gamepad controls in Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get a better Minecraft experience on Steam Deck or with Gamepads as a whole? Thanks to a new mod, it's easily possibly with the latest versions of Minecraft.</p>
<p>The new mod is named <a href="https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/MidnightControls" target="_blank">MidnightControls</a>, a fork of the old and unmaintained LambdaControls and it's open source. The developer who has taken it on has made sure it's cleaned up and working again, along with adding in support for the Steam Deck and in my own testing it works rather nicely. For this, I used the <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC" target="_blank">PolyMC</a> launcher available easily for Linux and Steam Deck. You can see a previous guide on PolyMC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/getting-minecraft-and-mods-on-steam-deck-is-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">in this article</a>.</p>
<p>First up is the video example on how to do it followed by the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zvj-6iUwdQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/429eb50e87933d2dee689b40c6a1cb2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zvj-6iUwdQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>First with PolyMC, set Steam Input into Gamepad with Mouse, and set the right trackpad to Left Mouse Click.</li>
<li>Open PolyMC, add a new instance and set the mod loader to Fabric and click Okay.</li>
<li>Now hit the View Mods button and then Download Mods.</li>
<li>Pick the Fabric API, MidnightLib and MidnightControls.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, load up your new Minecraft instance.</li>
<li>Go into the Options -&gt; Controls -&gt; Controller.</li>
<li>Set the Mode to Controller and under Appearance set Controller Type to Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Now you're all set and it will just work.</li>

      <title>How to play The Elder Scrolls Online on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is currently noted as Unsupported on Steam Deck but don't let that stop you. Getting it running is actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised it's noted as Unsupported though, considering how quirky the initial install actually is. You're not just downloading from Steam, you're also using their launcher to install an update and that is the main cause of the problems. A launcher being a nuisance — where have we all heard that before?</p>
<p>First up a video example, below that is the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3ahI0_czYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e29603491e6da845f63bb2258225e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3ahI0_czYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the game in your Steam Library, hit the little Cog icon on the right and go to Properties</li>
<li>In the launch options text field, add this: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE=1 %command%</code><br/>
<em>This basically sets up a fake drive in Proton for the game in your Steam Library that the launcher can read correctly</em></li>
<li>Now set Steam Input to Mouse and Keyboard to make it easier for now with the updater and launcher</li>
<li>Load it up, and when you get a black screen, simply press the A button. Proton currently doesn't render it properly, but it's just an accept button to continue on the installer<br/>
<em>You may find it dumps you back to the Steam Library, just reload and it eventually works. Mine only took one extra attempt</em></li>
<li>Load the game</li>
<li>Create / load into your character using the right trackpad as the mouse. Once in-game head to the Options menu in Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Gamepad &gt; Enable Gamepad</li>
<li>Open Steam Input again, set to Gamepad but edit the right trackpad to be a mouse with a left mouse click. This enables you to properly interact with the main menu and get proper gamepad controls in-game</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

      <title>You can now try Resident Evil Village directly in your browser using Stadia tech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capcom has released a cloud gaming browser demo of the popular Resident Evil Village, so you can try it out in only a click and a few seconds waiting on pretty much any platform. As long as you're using a Chromium-based browser, that is.</p>
<p>It uses "Immersive Stream for Games" from Google, which is their rebrand of the technology used for Stadia that they give out to publishers and developers for direct use. So while the actual Stadia store continues limping on, the tech behind it at least should live on for years as more developers offer up quick cloud demos like this.</p>
<p>Google noted in their <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/discovery-and-trial-immersive-stream-for-games/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it that they've continued to expand Stadia's own cloud game trials, with 15 games now available to try out at no cost without even having a Stadia account too and they plan to increase that number over the next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - a shot taken from testing it today.</em></p>
<p>For Resident Evil Village, it certainly helped that the developer already had a version for sale on Stadia, so they didn't need to do a port to Linux (since Stadia uses Linux) or wait for Google's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-talk-about-their-windows-emulator-for-stadia-and-they-use-dxvk-already/" target="_blank">upcoming Windows compatibility layer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.cid.capcom.com/top.html" target="_blank">Head over here</a> to try it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update improves Home Screen performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another small update to the Steam Deck, this time focusing on some bugs and UI performance.</p>
<p>Really, this is just Valve continuing to clean up after the last major <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> that came with better fan curves, refresh rate switching and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for the Home screen Recent Games carousel</li>
<li>Fixed boot glitching and crashes experienced by some customers</li>
<li>Fixed Quick Access volume sliders not working after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the controller reorder screen where moving to a controller slot higher than the current number of connected controllers would show as '!' until the Quick Access Menu screen is re-opened</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on YouTube</a> you're missing plenty of hands-on videos not covered in articles. Here's a couple recent videos:</p>

      <title>Dota 2 gets a nice performance improvement with the Vulkan renderer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Battle Report Update is out now for Dota 2, with the majority of it being for Dota Plus but there's also some of the usual balancing changes and a nice improvement for people using the Vulkan renderer.</p>
<p>Valve say it has a "significant performance improvement aimed at removing hitching when playing with the Vulkan renderer". They're making use of the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension, which is currently only supported by the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver</a> but it will be coming to the stable drivers for all vendors eventually. So if you're on NVIDIA, perhaps give it a try and see what you think.</p>
<p>For Dota Plus there's loads new!

      <title>Arietta of Spirits gets fixed up for 30FPS mode on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arietta of Spirits, a story-driven action-adventure game with easy to approach game mechanics, has a new update out that makes it run better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Arietta of Spirits is a charming adventure game with emotion-filled narrative, no-filler gameplay, and fast paced combat. The game tells the story of Arietta and her family, visiting their Grandmother's cabin for the first time after her passing away a year prior. However, the family trip takes an unexpected turn when Arietta meets a mysterious new friend and gains the ability to see strange spirits that inhabit the island."</p>
<p>It's currently Steam Deck Verified, but it appears that verification didn't test putting it down to 30FPS. At least now it's accurate properly. Some games just don't work well below 60FPS due to the way they are programmed, and it seems this is one of them. Thankfully, the developer noticed some reports on it and released a patch to improve it. Now it will work properly at 30FPS which saves battery life.</p>
<p>The developer also fixed up pixel perfect scaling at aspect ratios other than 16:9, added speedrunning features and fixed some other issues.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood gets a small update for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/back-4-blood-adds-experimental-support-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Back in April</a> the Zombie shooter Back 4 Blood added experimental support for the Steam Deck, and they're continuing the support along with a new patch.</p>
<p>Along with lots of tweaks to weapon balancing and some new features, they've now added some dedicated default graphical options for the Steam Deck and there's multiple to pick from. This is great, and something I hope more developers add in so Steam Deck players can get the best possible experience. It already worked <em>very</em> nicely out of the box, but hey more tweaks that the developer has directly tested is always welcome.</p>
<p>You can see my previous look at the performance in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x7CHdPuOXxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94da3ce1d3778cd2821c727dac295b96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x7CHdPuOXxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the new features in this update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Deck Draw
	<ul>
<li>Play all 15 cards from your deck at the start of a Campaign for all difficulties.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We felt like the 15 card draw in No Hope went over well with the community, and wanted to roll out this option to all difficulties. In the future we are considering adding multiple deck styles like ordered draw and full random decks. Some difficulties have been rebalanced to work better with this feature.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player Kicking
	<ul>
<li>The new Player Kicking system identifies and allows kicking from a Mission when a Cleaner is idle for too long or deals too much friendly fire damage.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We discussed this feature at length to try and do what's best for the community, so we want to try this conditional kick feature that will only trigger if someone is playing outside the bounds of the game. We also feel that the traditional Vote to Kick can be exploitable and toxic. This feature is not final and we will be monitoring it closely.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New banners, sprays, and emblems</li>
<li>12 New Burn Cards</li>
<li>New Warped Chest Corruption Cards</li>
<li>New Cleaner skins</li>
<li>Legendary Accessories</li>
<li>A more detailed breakdown of Supply Points, Copper, and Skull Totems is now present on the post-round screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/back-4-blood?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>One of the highest rated games on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition from Larian Studios recently became Steam Deck Verified. Plus, we have a longer talk from Swen Vincke, the Founder and Creative Director of Larian Studios.</p>
<p>It gained official Steam Deck Verified status last week, which I somehow completely missed. Looking over the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">top 250</a> on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is number 68 of the most highly rated games so it clearly has a lot of fans and is arguably one of the best RPGs available on Steam too.</p>
<p>Back when the Steam Deck released, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6UXZH_FONg" target="_blank">had a few clips</a> of developers talking about the Steam Deck and their games, as it turns out Larian had kept back more of their footage that they just released that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kzfEkSGa45k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b13c3fdf69d8c682b443c651ece3454.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kzfEkSGa45k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In short: they're going to ensure all their games and future games work well on it. Really nice to hear!</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_2" target="_blank">on GOG</a> if you wish to try with Wine.</p>

      <title>Linux hardware vendor System76 is coming to Europe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you wanting to get some hardware from Linux vendor System76 but they don't currently ship to you, or it's expensive to do so? Well, you're in luck! They're coming to Europe. System76 make a lot of hardware including desktops, laptops, servers and a keyboard now too (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">which I reviewed</a>).</p>
<p>In an interview over on Tweakers (<a href="https://netherlands.postsen.com/technology/18352/System76-gets-distribution-center-in-Europe-and-is-working-on-a-new-keyboard-%E2%80%93-Computer-%E2%80%93-News.html" target="_blank">translated</a>), they spoke to System76 principal engineer Jeremy Soller, who confirmed "Laptops and desktops have a lot of restrictions and the costs are higher, so we will start with our Launch keyboard and sell it from a European distribution center, so that the shipping costs and taxes for that market are lower".</p>
<p>This is quite exciting, as their products are generally quite highly rated too, and I know plenty of people in the Linux space personally who use them too. Being able to get my own hands on one of their laptops would be excellent, and I've been lusting over their Thelio desktop case since it was first announced — so looks like I have some saving to do.</p>
<p>When can we expect this to happen? Sometime "in the coming months" Soller said. System76 are working on adjusting their Launch keyboard for ISO versions, and they're looking for storage space to set up their distribution location. They're also working on a smaller version of the keyboard with a Lite version with a 65% layout and no integrated USB 3.2 hub.</p>
<p>Thankfully their laptops are already conforming to the CE marking needed for Europe and they're working on the keyboard layout there. For desktops, they're working towards certification but of course it's far more complicated than a keyboard.</p>

<p>Minecraft 1.19 - The Wild Update is out now. Not only that, all owners now get both Java &amp; Bedrock together as they've been merged into a single purchase.</p>

<p>Some of what's new includes the Mangrove Swamp biome, Mangrove Trees, Mangrove Blocks, Mud and Mud Brick Blocks, Clay renewability, Frogs and Tadpoles, the Deep Dark biome, Ancient Cities, Darkness mob effect, Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker, and Sculk Catalyst Blocks, Warden mob, Allay mob, Boat with Chest, new music, 3D Directional Audio simulation and much more has been added in.</p>

      <title>Some new interesting Steam Deck Verified titles, there&#39;s now over 3,200 confirmed Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested in picking up some more games that will work nicely on Steam Deck or a Linux desktop? Here's a quick run over some recent notable titles that are fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The amount is always increasing, as a bunch go through Deck Verified every day. There's a lot that are Playable and Unsupported but if you just want a click and play experience, this is a nice little reminder for you on what's around. Going by the numbers it's now on 3,245 in total as Verified or Playable. As a reminder though: there are games listed as Unsupported that actually do work, and those that aren't tested doesn't mean they don't work — a lot more do.</p>
<ul>

      <title>Dome Keeper is going to be my next craving, demo is great on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper, previously known as Dome Romantik, has a brand new demo available and after testing it, I fear it's yet another simple but addictive game I'm going to wake up craving to play more. Built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it has perfect Linux support so far as I can tell and it feels like perfection on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>It's a rogue-lite game about defending and upgrading a Dome on a hostile planet, while you dig down below for riches. Quite simple overall but it has that repeatable hook that suckers you into it as the hours fade away. I love the differences between the two sections of the game. The drilling and mining is quite peaceful and fun exploration, while the combat parts feel absolutely nuts at times and really can make you sweat.</p>

      <title>Linux Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for fan of Arm devices, as developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/conformant-open-source-support-for-mali-g57.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture.</p>
<p>This open source graphics driver now has <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_980" target="_blank">fully-conformant</a> OpenGL ES 3.1 on Mali-G57, a Valhall GPU, with the final Mesa patches landing and the kernel patches are <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=5ba99fca1de0272ce05b65f19bcc184b5cb43285" target="_blank">queued for merge upstream</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, it means the MediaTek Chromebooks with the MT8192 and MT8195 system-on-chips like the ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3 will work out of the box with accelerated graphics providing you have Mesa 22.2 and an appropriate kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3</em></p>
<p>Seems it's a nice improvement over the previous generation chip too, with better Vulkan performance and hardware changes to improve other problems they had with the previous generation.</p>

      <title>RimWorld has another upgrade out for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld on Steam Deck gets even better with the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/294100/announcements/detail/3325358588164752807" target="_blank">update</a>, as the developer continues tweaking to give the best experience possible. While it is thoroughly playable thanks to the last major update, a few lingering issues remained that hopefully this patch will solve.</p>
<p>Specifically for Steam Deck here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple cases where on Steam Deck some keyboard shortcuts were mentioned</li>
<li>Commands now show "button A" glyph instead of "A" label on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>When architect search bar is focused on a Steam Deck and the on-screen keyboard is visible, move gizmos up so that they're still visible.</li>
<li>Added "Keyboard mode" option on Steam Deck in case someone connects a keyboard to the SteamDeck.</li>
<li>Fix: Dismissing on-screen keyboard on SteamDeck doesn't unfocus the text field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a previous quick-look I did below:</p>

      <title>iFixit have the Steam Deck Battery prices up but already sold out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">official iFixit launch</a> for Steam Deck replacement parts but one major bit was missing — the Battery. Now though, it seems the store pages for it are properly live and they're already out of stock.</p>
<p>As I was writing this the EU and UK <em>had</em> some stock, I refreshed and they were <em>gone</em> so obviously a few people were waiting ready. Originally, when the initial launch happened there were only placeholder pages for the Battery replacements and no prices. iFixit told various outlets that they didn't currently have a solution to it but it seems that's being solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18030585181654597571gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - the full Battery Kit</em></p>
<p>So while you again can't buy it yet, we at least now have the full price required now:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597360dbcbf1" target="_blank">UK</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  £84.99</li>
<li>Kit:  £89.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Battery/IF260-001?o=2" target="_blank">US</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  $89.99</li>
<li>Kit:  $94.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597323dbcbf1&amp;variant=39920887169105" target="_blank">EU</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only: €89,95</li>
<li>Kit: €94,95</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently they're still missing the replacements for various main buttons. While they have the triggers, they do not have the D-pad, Action buttons, Steam button, Quick Access button and others missing too.</p>

      <title>Gamers Nexus have a fascinating look at the Steam Deck fan situation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For all the hype around the Steam Deck there is one major controversy with the fan. There's two fans being used, with one having a noticeably louder pitch than the other and now Gamers Nexus are attempting to find out why and how bad it is.</p>
<p>Since I've been through both fan types, I can safely say they are very different in the type of noise they give out and it's good to see people with the right equipment attempt to dive into the <em>why</em>. The original fan that was used in the review units is still used, Valve just switch to whatever they have available at production time it seems. The original "Huaying" model sounds more like a nice blower, but the "Delta" fan gives this annoying high-pitch <em>whine</em>. Although, recent fan curve updates from Valve has dramatically helped with that.</p>
<p>In the Gamers Nexus video they do a tear-down of each fan, and you can see there are some pretty big differences. Notable bits being the blade design with the Delta fan blades being much more curved, how close the Delta fan is to the inside casing and the Delta fan outer casing also has bigger cut-outs for airflow too.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the Gamers Nexus video below because it's a good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G2EEtzhsr2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b615b1138b32bd7b7319c5048413f22f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G2EEtzhsr2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The good news is that if it bothers you, it's clearly real easy to swap the fan for a different one as it's really accessible. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">iFixit are also stocking</a> the original less-noisy fan, although they're out of stock as expected.</p>

      <title>Diablo Immortal works on Steam Deck, plus a fix for Battle.net being slow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Diablo Immortal is the hot new thing, I decided to attempt to give it a go on Steam Deck. Turns out the Battle.net launcher really hates some connections, here's a fix and a Diablo Immortal video.</p>
<p>Currently, Diablo Immortal does work on Steam Deck (and so Linux desktops too) but it seems gamepad support is not working yet. So you will need to use Steam Input to adjust your configuration of any gamepad or Steam Deck to act like a keyboard and mouse. For the most part, that works reasonably well, not that I would recommend it considering the ridiculous micro-transactions involved in the game.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's the video of it running:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E4J2-nlTzHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99f08895d96545ef532ad0cb18f23e4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E4J2-nlTzHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You might find the Battle.net launcher which you can install easily with Lutris (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/lutris-now-has-a-flatpak-beta-available-and-updated-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck Lutris Guide</a>) can take <em>forever</em> to actually load or do anything. Now, this might be specific to whatever WiFi hardware you have, in my case it's the Google Mesh WiFi system and Blizzard don't seem to like it. An easy fix though is to manually set your DNS to <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/" target="_blank">1.1.1.1</a> (or any other free DNS service). On Steam Deck, simply right click on the WiFi icon in Desktop Mode and hit Configure Network Connections:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From there in the IPv4 (and IPv6 tab if you use it), switch it to "Automatic (Only addresses)" in the Method dropdown box and then set DNS Servers to 1.1.1.1. After that, disconnect and reconnect via the WiFi icon on your Plasma taskbar at the bottom and then reload Battle.net and it will work properly. It's incredibly weird but it works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you can properly use the Battle.net launcher on Steam Deck, if you also had this weird problem.</p>
<p>You can also add Lutris to Steam as a Non-Steam game, which allows you to launch Lutris and Diablo Immortal in Gaming Mode (so you're not stuck in Desktop Mode). I can confirm that also works just fine.</p>

      <title>GOG Summer Sale now live with new releases from SEGA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For readers who prefer to shop over on GOG, their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">Summer Sale</a> has just started along with some new releases.</p>
<p>To go along with it, more SEGA titles are joining GOG with the first being <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alien_isolation_collection" target="_blank">Alien: Isolation Collection</a>. Plus <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/two_point_hospital" target="_blank">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_40000_space_marine" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine</a> are coming soon. All for Windows though but you can try with Wine if you wish.</p>
<p>GOG has a few fun collections up to browser through including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_80s" target="_blank">80's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_90s" target="_blank">90's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_00s" target="_blank">2000's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_10s" target="_blank">2010's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_20s" target="_blank">2020's Games</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">full sale page is here</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm tempted by <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/metal_gear_solid" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid</a>. An absolute classic I remember fondly blasting through on the original PlayStation and would love to sit in bed with that on the Steam Deck. It's only 29% off though so not a big discount but should be easy to get going with the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>Additionally, GOG are giving away Sanitarium for 48 hours. Scroll down the <a href="https://www.gog.com/" target="_blank">homepage</a> to find the banner to click.</p>
<p>Let everyone know in the comments if there's a particularly good deal you're going for.</p>
<p>Their sale runs until June 27th, 2022.</p>

      <title>Free to play shooter Rogue Company verified &#39;Playable&#39; on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Company, a free to play shooter from First Watch Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently had an update of Easy Anti-Cheat and now it's confirmed as "Playable" (not fully Verified) on Steam Deck. The situation is a little odd for the Linux desktop though.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, it works out of the box. It's noted as <em>Playable</em>, as it has some text sizing issues and you may need to bring up the on-screen keyboard manually. In my own testing though, it was great. Not only does it perform well but it looks really good and feels like a great fit for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a39F7N-Upzs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba69e2cb65fbf1589d0a46d313d9a1b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a39F7N-Upzs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Linux desktop though, there's currently some issues preventing it working properly. If you install Steam as a Flatpak, it seems to work. With a normal Steam install though, a lot of distributions don't have it working. Thankfully, developers RichardYao and "GloriousEggroll" (GE-Proton dev), discovered <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/v4xezh/figured_out_reverts_needed_to_run_rogue_company/" target="_blank">the issue</a> is with glibc 2.35/34. Now the issue is known, hopefully it can be solved so more Linux gamers can play it too.</p>
<p>Free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/872200/Rogue_Company/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Endlanders is a glitchy RPG with real-time deck-building grid-based combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Endlanders and the prologue demo Endlanders : First Encounter have a graphics style that reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter and Resolutiion while offering rather different gameplay. A game that offers up a single-player RPG experience, along with a blending of deck-building and real-time grid-based combat wrapped up in a glitchy world.</p>
<p>"Delve into foreign worlds, translate languages, combat enemies and understand the universe."</p>
<p>One fun feature that sets it apart from other grid fighters, is that the grids aren't special stages. You can create a combat grid nearly anywhere, as long as there's enough space, so you're fighting on the map you're exploring.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UN7PcWnqeSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3899c386c11a781dc27892c8b239f0ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UN7PcWnqeSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endlanders/endlanders" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, this game is developed with the free and open source Godot Engine and plans for a release in 2024 but you can play the Endlanders : First Encounter now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2010450/Endlanders__First_Encounter/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), considered the &#39;precursor&#39; to Counter-Strike now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), a free and open source first-person shooter that the developers say "spawned one of the most popular and influential games of all time, Counter-Strike" is now available on Steam. Originally developed in 1998 to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iLc8OnzFpmQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66ed620b1be33d564201e92fc1f8729b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iLc8OnzFpmQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers say the new release has been upgraded, with plenty of polish to make it worth playing.</p>
<p>Various modes available:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Deathmatch - Spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached. Additional "unique" equipment can be picked up throughout, meaning that only one exists on that map at any time.</li>
<li>Capture the Flag - You will have to team up with other players and manage your offense and defense in pursuit of bringing the enemy's flag to your base in order to score. The team that captures the enemy flag the most wins!</li>
<li>Teamplay - Players are split into two teams and play is round based. Players select one primary weapon and one item to use, in addition to the default pistol and knife. The teams spawn on opposite sides of the map and are then let loose to kill each other. If one team eliminates the other, they win the round.</li>
<li>Team Deathmatch - Like Deathmatch but with teams, spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached.</li>
<li>Play Offline - Engage in battle against bots that will challenge your skills both with and without using your network connection. You can adjust their capability as well as select from several game modes.</li>
<li>Espionage - Similar to teamplay mode, with the exception that the team points are awarded based on successful completion of a scenario. Players also respawn periodically, a fixed amount of time, if a certain amount of members of the team are dead, or instantly. Scenario types CNH, CTB and OFC are continuous play, as in there's no 'end' to a round until the roundlimit or timelimit is reached. The others types rounds end when an objective is met.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Gravitar: Recharged released from Atari revamping another classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another remake of a classic has landed, with Atari's Gravitar from the 80s now being available on Steam with Gravitar: Recharged. This was was in collaboration with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox, along with artist and composer Megan McDuffee.</p>
<p>Blending the action of Asteroids and Space Duel, along with the physics fun of Lunar Lander, Gravitar was pretty popular back in the day and remembered quite fondly for the challenge but it was not a commercial hit at release. Perhaps now it might do a little better?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zAeimDfxYWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3fdc9aa1edb2cf7b3b1158048c3191df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zAeimDfxYWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gravitar: Recharged Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Far from Home: Travel across the galaxy in arcade mode, visiting planets to progress through ever-more-challenging solar systems in a quest to get home     </li>
<li>Explore, Triumph, Repeat: Take on 24 distinct missions, aiming to climb global leaderboards and assert yourself as the ultimate space adventurer     </li>
<li>Powerful Power-Ups: Utilizing the tech at your disposal, make use of your tractor beam to grab power-ups including homing missiles and electrifying EMP disruptors     </li>
<li>Not so Lonely Anymore: No longer doomed to wander the universe alone, play with a partner in each game mode. Connect to your player two via a tether and work together to accomplish each goal and make your way home.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905430/Gravitar_Recharged" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Since Atari seem to be going back through their classics to bring out updated version, is there a particular game you want them to do next?</p>

      <title>Craftomation 101 merges survival, crafting and automation programming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the developer of while True: learn() and Learning Factory comes yet another game with programming. Craftomation 101 brings together elements of a survival game, crafting and automation.</p>
<p>The idea is to help teach visual programming in a fun way, letting you tell robots what to do while helping them to survive on a frozen planet. Your mission is to make the planet habitable so you need to build up resources, make tools, melt ice, plant trees and produce oxygen. You could do it yourself, but with an army of programmable robots, why not get them to do it?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rdaPcULSnCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab76881a2aed9cd0562427c08805f9f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rdaPcULSnCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an email, the developer explained how the idea came about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically, it all started when one of us (not me) tried to create a piece of javascript to try all the craft combinations in one really nice web game. But it’s too silly to be the reason for creating a whole game (okay it was me and I was kinda close to succeeding with this javascript).</p>
<p>The other piece of this puzzle was in a huge spreadsheet with feedback from players of our previous game <strong>while True: learn()</strong>. A lot of players asked us to add more “real programming” in our next games.</p>
<p>Another thing we were inspired by was an amazing article <em>Artificial Living Plants</em> by Edward F. Moore (1956). It was dedicated to using self-replicating machines for resource mining and production (not just on Earth, but on other planets as well). Additionally I was shocked by the idea of Freeman Dyson who proposed using self-replicating machines to deliver ice from Enceladus to Mars to help with terraforming.</p>
<p>It all lead us to brainstorming: what kind of game could encompass all those amazing concepts, while showcasing programming as a really useful tool for automating various systems, small or huge?</p>
<p>To be honest, “self-replicating programmable robots used for terraforming” sounds really charming, inspiring, and awesome to us. We simply had to try and make this concept into something playable!</p>
<p>The work began in early 2021, as our artist Alex started making sketches, while Dima and Ivan were getting familiar with the Defold game engine (read below) and how it works with Spine animations.</p>
<p>But the real push for us was Ludum Dare 48, which happened in April '21. This online event suggests participants to develop their games in 48 or 72 hours sprints, and we at Luden.io have a long lasting tradition of participating in it.</p>
<p>After a short brainstorm, we decided to make a game about mining resources and investing them into something - something cool, like building a rocket! So we’ve piled up some premade art assets, ideas that could be implemented in a short period of time, and a lot of coffee - and made it into a prototype.</p>
<p>That was a glitchy, but fun little game. After reading 30+ cheerful comments with tons of kind words and meaningful feedback, we thought that the concept was worth working on.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s another big Queer Games Bundle live on itch.io for 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to support queer creators? Now is a good chance for you, while also grabbing a whole chunk of games too in the Queer Games Bundle 2022.</p>
<p>This is another example of how great the game store itch.io is, with it previously hosting multiple mega charity bundles. This one is a bit different though, since you will be <em>directly</em> supporting various developers. Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/itchio-hosting-a-huge-queer-games-bundle-2021-with-hundreds-included/" target="_blank">last year</a>, it comes in two editions with a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1404/queer-games-bundle-2022" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1405/queer-games-bundle-2022-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">pay what you can</a> edition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life changing way and in exchange you get over 500 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buying it helps support over 400 different creators and gain access to over 500 incredible varied experiences, no doubt a bit of something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>The main bundle has already raised over $20,000 at time of writing and it runs for another month so there's plenty of time to look through it.</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-3 in testing, will bring more game compatibility to Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and their partner CodeWeavers are working towards the next major upgrade of Proton, the compatibility layer for running Windows games on Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Proton 7.0-3 just had a first public <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5881" target="_blank">Release Candidate build</a>, while they ask for some help testing to see if there's any major problems before rolling it out to everyone. A lot of the improvements here are coming over directly from Proton Experimental, so all the advancements there will end up being the default version of Proton used for lots of games.</p>
<p>If you wish to try it out, here's what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for "Proton 7.0" in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into the Properties on it.</li>
<li>Select Betas from the left panel.</li>
<li>Find release-candidate in the drop-down and then let it update.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can also see a previous video <a href="https://youtu.be/c1SiIp8KJm0" target="_blank">example guide</a> I did for the Proton Experimental Beta on Steam Deck, it's the same method but for Proton 7.</em></p>
<p>While it may change before the final release, these are listed as newly playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age of Chivalry</li>
<li>Beneath a Steel Sky</li>
<li>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li>
<li>Cities XXL</li>
<li>Cladun X2</li>
<li>Cursed Armor</li>
<li>Disney•Pixar Cars Mater-National Championship</li>
<li>Gary Grigsby's War in the East</li>
<li>Gary Grigsby's War in the West</li>
<li>Iragon: Prologue</li>
<li>MechWarrior Online</li>
<li>Saviors of Sapphire Wings</li>
<li>Small Radios Big Televisions</li>
<li>Split/Second</li>
<li>Star Wars Episode I Racer</li>
<li>Stranger of Sword City Revisited</li>
<li>Succubus x Saint</li>
<li>V Rising</li>
<li>Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide</li>
<li>We Were Here Forever</li>
<li>Planetary Annihilation: TITANS</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot of other improvements too including video playback fixed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disintegration</li>
<li>Dread X Collection: The Hunt</li>
<li>EZ2ON REBOOT : R</li>
<li>El Hijo - A Wild West Tale</li>
<li>Ember Knights</li>

<li>Solasta: Crown of the Magister</li>
<li>Street Fighter V</li>
<li>The Room 4: Old Sins</li>

</ul>
<p>Plus these other assorted fixes:</p>

      <title>Hands of Necromancy is an upcoming GZDoom powered dark fantasy shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love retro shooters? How about those with a little magical flair to them and dark fantasy? The GZDoom engine powered Hands of Necromancy is coming to Steam with a teaser demo up now.</p>
<p>The developer explains that it's a metroidvania styled game, in the spirit of the classics like Heretic. Looks pretty great too, and also awesome to see more developer use the thoroughly versatile cross-platform GZDoom instead of reinventing the wheel again for a game engine that's well suited for the classic FPS style and mechanics. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ga11coGneIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c96e7b75364f5aac2b3eb59d3abc031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ga11coGneIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Old Skies is an upcoming time travel adventure from Wadjet Eye Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great looking point and click adventure is on the way from Wadjet Eye Games! They just recently teased their latest called Old Skies. They also confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/WadjetEyeGames/status/1532053665137274880" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it will support Linux too and there will be a demo available during Steam Next Fest which happens next week.</p>
<p>"Time Travel is real and history is up for grabs! In this point-and-click, you play Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency. Your job is to keep close watch on seven travelers who have the desire (and the bank accounts) to sightsee in the past. Some are simply curious. Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."</p>

<p>This is looking really great! Some wonderful work on the visuals for this one.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Seven eras of history to visit! From the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th.</li>
<li>High resolution 1920 x 1080 graphics! That's 3x higher than Unavowed.</li>
<li>Lots of puzzles that require temporal thinking to solve.</li>
<li>Death! You CAN die in this adventure game, but time travel means you can try again. And again. And again.</li>
<li>Musical score by Thomas Regin (composer for Unavowed and the Blackwell series)</li>
<li>Full voice acting! Our largest cast yet.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck now lets you override display resolution for games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some games on Steam Deck that won't get the right resolution? Now you can force them into what you want. This will be useful for quite a lot of retro games especially, and some that just won't behave.</p>
<p>Announced as part of a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287861418016" target="_blank">update</a>, you can now go into the Properties menu of any app on Steam Deck and select to force the resolution:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/564345141654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/564345141654247666gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the full update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Game Resolution setting to App Properties, allowing players to override the max display resolution for games, on a a per-game basis</li>
<li>Added mouse cursor (using right trackpad) for built-in web browser interactions when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved default aspect ratio behavior for external monitors - games will now default to 1280x800 for 16:10 external displays and 1280x720 for all other external displays</li>
<li>Improved UI performance in game carousels</li>
<li>Improved UI performance when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved controller order when using external gamepads to assign the controller slots by the order of input. This should help with compatibility in games which locked onto the Steam Deck controller.</li>
<li>Fixed 'Enable updated fan control' toggle not remembering its state across reboots</li>
<li>Fixed Bluetooth controllers not working on the lockscreen</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on the Steam Deck Chord Summary page</li>
<li>Fixed issue preventing deletion of some controller layouts</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled adaptive brightness toggle, as it was causing performance and stability issues. Big thanks to the community for catching this weird bug - we're working on a fix for it now.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve reveals the top 10 most played Steam Deck titles and they&#39;re all fully Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just put up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3332113352306852873" target="_blank">another</a> of their round-up posts going over all the recent work on the Steam Deck, and they also revealed the current most popular titles.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>For regular readers this won't be news since I go over the changes often but it's still a good catch-up for those who have fallen a bit behind on the news. Some of what's new includes the lock screen, multiple window support, keyboard improvements, external display upgrades, per-application performance profiles, improved fan behaviour and more. Check out their video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZtkISSyZYSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5ae9bff9f932f2823d5c3bce1d4cdb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZtkISSyZYSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what's popular based on user play-time (<a href="https://twitter.com/gregcoomer/status/1532876301014421506" target="_blank">source</a>), over the last month these were the most popular on Steam Deck</p>
<ul>
<li>Elden Ring </li>
<li>Vampire Survivors </li>
<li>Rogue Legacy 2 </li>
<li>Stardew Valley </li>
<li>No Man's Sky </li>
<li>Slay the Spire </li>
<li>Hades </li>
<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </li>
<li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth </li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve was keen to point out that it's not just because of Steam Deck upgrades or Proton, but effort directly from developers too and four of those titles were previously listed as Unsupported or Playable until they got updated to be Verified. They're making a clear and obvious point: if developers get their games supported, players are more likely to buy them and spend time in them — not exactly a big surprise. Plenty of us just want to play games and not have to tinker so hopefully more will get cracking on updating their games.</p>

      <title>Splitgate the free online FPS with portals has Season 2 live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mixing together some fast-paced shooter with a bit of a Halo feel and portals like out of Valve's Portal series, Splitgate has a big new update out now.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of new content additions, one of the biggest changes is to the matchmaking system. Matchmaker 2.0 brings with it faster and smarter matchmaking with human players (less bot matches), players can now be added into an in-progress unranked match if it began less than a minute prior, players are more likely to hop directly into a match than having to be in a waiting area and much more.</p>
<p>There's also three new game modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juggernaut </strong>(Free For All): Every player against one (hard to kill) Juggernaut selected at random. Score points by surviving as the Juggernaut.</li>
<li><strong>Hotzone </strong>(Team): Capture and control the neutral zone for 30 seconds to score a point. </li>
<li><strong>Lockdown </strong>(Team): Score a point by controlling all three hills at the same time. After each point, the hills move.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new progression system is also in, they revamped the interface, big additions to the map editor and the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/splitgate-beta-season-2-patch-notes" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bLbqB6DmEfA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fce69ca6884054105f59dcbf336ea928.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bLbqB6DmEfA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game definitely feels a lot better than when I tried it previously. While it was fun before, it did have a few minor tech troubles (especially in the Linux build there were some quirks) but it seems to be thoroughly smooth now, seems like they improved it a lot overall. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Splitgate is free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 and HP bring the HP Dev One with Pop!_OS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/hp-teamed-up-with-system76-for-the-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os-linux/" target="_blank">we reported previously</a>, The HP Dev One is a new laptop collaboration from System76 and HP that brings Pop!_OS Linux to even more people. It's now available to order.</p>
<p>Quite an exciting one, as it's always good to see more vendors dip their toes into selling and supporting Linux machines directly. Not only that, it's interesting because it's one hardware vendor teaming up with another. Hopefully this is the shape of things to come with more collaboration. Right now it's only available in the USA and priced at $1,099.</p>
<p>Some key specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processor</strong> - AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> - 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR4 3200 MT/s (2 SODIMM)</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - 1 TB PCIe 3x4 NVMe M.2 2280 SSD</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> - AMD Radeon Graphics</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - 14” diagonal FHD LED UWWA for HD Webcam (1920x1080) (1000 Nits)</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong> - Dual stereo speakers, 2 multi-array microphone</li>
<li><strong>Wireless</strong> - Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2x2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 combo</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> - HP Smart 65 W External AC power adapter</li>
<li><strong>Ports</strong> - 2 SuperSpeed USB Type-C 10Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery, DisplayPortTM 1.4); 2 SuperSpeed USB Type- A 5Gbps signaling rate (1 charging); 1 headphone/ microphone combo; 1 HDMI 2.0; 1 AC power</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong> - HP Long Life 3-cell, 53 Wh Li-ion</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> - 12.73 x 8.44 x 0.75 in; 32.34 x 21.46 x 1.91 cm</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“System76 is thrilled to work with HP to advance open source and bring the Linux desktop to a much wider audience,” said Carl Richell, CEO, System76. “By bringing together our engineering, marketing, and customer support, System76 with HP are introducing HP Dev One to combine powerful hardware with optimized Pop!_OS for the app dev community.”</p>
<p>“Pop!_OS development and innovation has always been a top priority for System76,” said Jeremy Soller, principal engineer, System76. “We are working to develop new features and optimize current ones into Pop!_OS at a much faster pace than previously possible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>“Software developers are looking for a device that is customized and optimized for the way they code,” said Tylitha Stewart, Vice President and Global Head of Consumer Services and Subscriptions, HP Inc. “By working with System76, we are meeting this need and providing a premium experience with Linux Pop!_OS preinstalled to deliver the new HP Dev One. The device has features important to developers including an optional Linux keyboard tuned with a super key and designed to be more efficient at the core.”</p>
<p>I'm hoping to see a review unit, so keep an eye out for what I think in the coming weeks. I might also be having a chat with System76 CEO Carl Richell about it soon too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck already hits over 5% of Linux users on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for May 2022, and while it sees a tiny drop in the overall Linux user share, we can see the Steam Deck rising up. As usual, our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> has been updated for the latest figures, with a screenshot of the current status below for all to see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the overall Linux share is <u>1.12%</u>. Still a pretty clear upwards trend, and drops in a couple months are to be expected as that's just how things go. No doubt it will bounce up again within a couple months. The interesting thing to see now though, is how the Steam Deck will affect it since Valve actually hooked up the survey in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-gets-per-app-performance-profiles-hardware-survey-and-loads-more/" target="_blank">recent Steam Deck update</a>.</p>
<p>When filtering to <em>just</em> Linux, here's the current top:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 12.85% +0.53%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 11.75% -2.53%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 11.09% -0.46%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 8.04% +8.04%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 5.97% -0.39%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 5.23% +5.23%</li>
<li>Other 45.07% +6.46%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might look like Arch Linux is on top at a quick glance, but not quite, since you need to take into account the various versions of Ubuntu as people tend to stick to LTS releases for years. The real interesting thing to see though is <strong>SteamOS Holo</strong>, which is the Arch-based Steam Deck operating system already hitting well over 5% of Linux users on Steam. Not only that, the Steam Deck GPU "AMD AMD Custom GPU 0405" is shown as the second most popular already for just Linux systems on Steam.</p>
<p>Using May's 1.12% share, that puts Linux users at around ~1,478,400 estimated "monthly active users" based on the last time Valve gave out their user data. You could say that to be around ~77,320 Steam Deck users, although keep in mind it’s an additional device for a lot of people, it depends where the survey is taken. The actual number is likely higher.</p>

      <title>Valve delay the Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a move that's not exactly unexpected, Valve has now delayed the launch of the official Steam Deck Docking Station.</p>
<p>Written in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287857025157" target="_blank">official update</a>, the Valve team said it was due to both a shortage of parts and closures at their manufacturing facility due to COVID. No further date has been given and they said they will share more info when they have it. The good news though is that the schedule for shipping the actual Steam Deck is not affected as it's different parts and a different factory responsible for it.</p>
<p>Valve ended the post by mentioning how they continue to improve the "docked experience for Steam Deck with all USB-C hubs and external displays".</p>
<p>Right now, the docked experience isn't the best. For all the pros the Steam Deck has, the docked experience is something of a sore spot. It's a mixture of things between issues in the KDE Plasma desktop when connecting up external monitors, to resolution issues in Gaming Mode when docked. The problems are all solvable and for the most part it works but there's a lot of quirks left to solve. Valve may not have said so, but it's likely also a big factor in the decision not to release it yet.</p>
<p>If you are after a USB Hub that works well, I've used <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">this</a> for months now and it has been working nicely for me.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect - Gangs DLC and free Kite update announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox and Double Eleven have announced the Prison Architect: Gangs expansion, along with the free Kite update. Here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>I don't think this exactly needs much of an explanation does it? I think we all know what a gang is huh? Inmates will now form up, with different groups having their own personality and reputation inside your prison. As gangs grow and flex their power, things might get a little bit heated. Thankfully, you get a few new tricks to deal with them too.</p>
<p>Gangs DLC Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meet the gang: </strong>Gangs form and grow by gang members arriving by in-take or by recruitment. Each gang has its own personality and traits, and will naturally be drawn to recruiting prisoners with the same specific attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Now you can measure your inmates and your prison’s “temperature”. As gangs grow and begin to flex their strength, the 'danger temperature' of your prison will rise. Thanks to the 'Boiling point' UI, you get a detailed overview of what's affecting the life of your inmates, allowing you to act swiftly, keeping them happy, and preventing irrepressible riots.</li>
<li><strong>Reform and release:</strong> Gang members are now allowed to leave their crew, help them come clean by removing their tattoos and enrolling them in the Gang Rehabilitation Program.</li>
<li><strong>New rooms: </strong>Use the Tattoo Removal Room to remove gangs' tattoos, or have gang members train in the Fight Club Room, turning their destructive energy into fighting in a controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Crooked guards: </strong>Gangs may coerce guards into smuggling contraband or accepting bribes. You can vet guards during the hiring process (Bureaucracy) as well as recruit C.I.s to identify guards that have turned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their brief and not very useful announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54LgqxKijmo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b490b6fae8bed6e323f5a59996e748c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54LgqxKijmo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Gangs introduces a whole slew of creative challenges for Wardens to overcome. While it sounds intimidating, the Gangs expansion keeps things fun and light-hearted for our players," says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “We designed the reformation features to feel authentic while giving wardens clever options to handle gangs and increase their population's happiness. Gangs expands Prison Architect's management gameplay and adds enjoyable new mechanics, offering players a fuller and more fun gaming experience."</p>
<p>Due to release "soon" but no actual date given yet.</p>
<p>The free Kite expansion releasing at the same time will add in more wardens, guard dogs, room sizes, prison capacity options, improvements to the game menus and tweaks to other mechanics.</p>
<p>You can buy Prison Architect from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/prison_architect?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prison-architect?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Golfie mixes together minigolf with a deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've seen a few attempts to spice-up Golf like Golf with Your Friends which is great but how about blending it together with a deck-building card game? Golfie is the answer to that. Note: key provided for me. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and the Steam Deck, thanks to Steam Play Proton.</p>
<p>"Deckbuilding meets minigolf in Golfie – the only game in which you can power-up and modify realtime golf shots by collecting and crafting a deck of cards."</p>
<p>It's the game you know (and love?) but with the main quirk being your shots can be changed and warped with cards. You will need to use them too, as the courses are quite varied and need you to hop over obstacles or shoot around corners. It mostly works too and there's a lot of replay value here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i8cjYU9nbPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6298f6a1d4ea8f52e56f7782406ccfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i8cjYU9nbPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a pretty great idea actually, and with it being in Early Access it has plenty of room to grow and tweak the cards and the maps available to expand on the initial set. The developer expects to keep it in Early Access for around 9 months with plans to add in new cards, power-ups, course options and modes.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, you get an initial set of cards and it does take a good few runs to really get into it but thanks to the unlocks system you can really do some ridiculous stuff with the cards. Hovering your ball in the air with a jetpack, to smash it across the course is always hilarious.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Four distinct biomes such as Cherry Garden and the Dungeon to pitch and putt your way through</li>
<li>Procedurally generated nature of each hole, meaning no two courses are the same</li>
<li>Cards, coins and perks to collect on your way to golfing glory</li>
<li>Incredible shot synergies which can result in extraordinarily powerful ways to play – can you get a hole in *none*?</li>
<li>Entirely randomised courses or compete against the world in Daily Runs, which offer one chance to play the same course as the rest of the world</li>
<li>Free play mode offers mini golf without the pressure</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/golfie?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579020/Golfie/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom gets a Steam Deck update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom from Game Atelier and DG Entertainment recently gained a small but sweet update to improve gameplay on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it's currently tagged as "Unsupported" by Valve, this should hopefully bump it up to fully Verified. It previously had an issue where all the button mapping icons where broken. This latest update adds full support for the Steam Deck controls, and additionally adds in native 16:10 aspect ratio support too. Thanks to that update, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom should now be a great experience on Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ufE6mOdZ2U0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fe705f96f83214eeef3b82cbcc93cda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ufE6mOdZ2U0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six awesome forms</strong> with unique combat and platforming abilities to make your adventure exciting from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock new paths and secrets with special equipment:</strong> look for magic weapons and items that gradually open up the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 15 hours of epic adventure:</strong> explore the new Monster World in a vast interconnected environment.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Drawn animations:</strong> characters and enemies come to life with detailed animations and fun facial expressions.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack from iconic Japanese composers:</strong> Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Michiru Yamane, Keiki Kobayashi and Takeshi Yanagawa.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/449610/Monster_Boy_and_the_Cursed_Kingdom/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Or you can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/monster_boy_and_the_cursed_kingdom" target="_blank">GOG</a> if you want to try it with Wine.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at it running on a Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Steam Client Update released with Remote Play improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/139004" target="_blank">update</a> to the stable version of the Steam Client, with it mostly being about fixing up Remote Play. It's not a big surprise to see the focus on Remote Play right now with the Steam Deck, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> bringing full Remote Play Together compatibility for the Deck too.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved desktop capture quality on Windows, now supporting variable framerates</li>
<li>Fixed crash on Windows when the stream resolution is changed</li>
<li>Fixed streaming connections failing after Steam has been restarted</li>
<li>Fixed Remote Play Together dialogs occasionally not resizing correctly</li>
<li>Fixed color quality when streaming from Linux to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS/Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game install/update failing for Steam libraries installed on a filesystem that does not support preallocation (e.g. ExFAT, FAT32)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the Linux fixes there too, another reason to love the Steam Deck as it means other parts of Steam / Linux keep getting fixed up.</p>

      <title>Try out the demo for Ragtag Crew, a turn-based tactical rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo arriving as part of the DreamHack Beyond event, Ragtag Crew seems like a promising upcoming turn-based tactical rogue-lite to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Plenty of options to build up a full squad of scavengers, that you will send across a wasteland in pursuit of profit, food and lots of battles too of course. The developer mentions that each class not only has the usual differing abilities but also a little personality thrown into the mix that will provide an "unrepeatable adventure", as the combat is broken up by little events and each choice you make changes the history of your squad with a big pool of events to pull from.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NyB_RIHGG18"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3b960ef5ed7bf64f22df3329d28393e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NyB_RIHGG18" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each run, choose 3 characters out of 8 classes (some unlockable). Experiment with synergies and party compositions to slay everyone in your way!</li>
<li>Every character can choose a personality from the 7 available (some unlockable). These influence their dialogue, battle capabilities, relationships, morale, stats, and overall style — but most importantly, they can drastically change the course of events.</li>
<li>The heart of the game lies in the tough tactical fights. The enemies are strong, but often have flaws to exploit. Adapt, improve, overcome!</li>
<li>Slay bosses… or sneak past. These large and unique enemies come with their own mechanics and storylines. The rewards may be game-changing — but are you in a good enough condition to take them on? Sometimes it’s smarter to walk past a fight.</li>
<li>As you progress through the game, more options become available.</li>
<li>Every node on the map offers a text event. A smart choice can grant you loot, help two characters form a bond, or hint at the deeper truth behind the events. An unsuccessful one might end in a disaster.</li>
<li>Over the course of an adventure the party members will grow to become friends… or bitter enemies. Nudge their stories to receive unique events and outcomes!</li>
<li>From cute baby lizards to passionate fighter-pilgrims, all kinds of characters may aid you on your journey.</li>
<li>A mixture of post-apoc, Westerns, and sci-fi creates a relatable yet original world. "Firefly meets Douglas Adams."</li>
<li>Try again. Most bands of misfits fail — this is a roguelite, after all. But even failed runs bring progress in the form of unlockable classes, personalities, and items. You’ll be better equipped next time — and the game’s high variance offers high replayability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/882590/Ragtag_Crew/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's due for release later this year with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia is out along with a free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best strategy games around has grown with the Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia DLC now available, along with the usual Paradox free update for all players. Paradox call it a "flavor pack", so it's not quite a full expansion but has enough new content that looks like it may be worth picking up.</p>
<p>"A centuries long Struggle will force you to rethink how to achieve your goals, as a variety of interested and competing parties fight to impose their will on the Iberian Peninsula."</p>
<p>Features in the DLC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Struggle system: Entirely new system for historic conflict, available to modders and other content creators.</li>
<li>Decide the Fate of Iberia: Choose the path of conciliation or the path of conquest as you unite Spain or, alternately, agree to a peaceful division of spoils.</li>
<li>New content: Two new Legacy tracks (Metropolitan and Coterie), new cultural traits emphasizing special historical characteristics of the Iberian peninsula, new friendship interactions and duels over the chessboard.</li>
<li>New Events: Dynamic historical events related to the struggle for Iberia.</li>
<li>New Art: New character art reflecting Iberian cultures of the medieval era, new unit designs, new 3D models of holdings and artifacts  and a host of new art for backgrounds, events and loading.</li>
<li>New Music: Additions to the Crusader Kings III soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w0Av16wx6Y8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de7aa75d314a377afd86f01fa3c9f3ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w0Av16wx6Y8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for the free update, this is what's new there for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now convert to Era Zaharrak when you're an established Basque-cultured sinner in your current faith</li>
<li>Several faiths can now have the same Head of Faith:
	<ul>
<li>Several Islamic faiths now share a Head of Faith at game start, temporal Islamic faiths need to decide on creation which existing caliph they'll submit to (optional for Muhakkima &amp; Zandaqa)</li>
<li>Conversos, Mozarabic, Insular and Catholic all have the Pope as their Head of Faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Rite tenet, allowing theocratic faiths to retain their old Head of Faith on creation if they don't differ too heavily from their mother faith</li>
<li>Added Mozarabic Christianity as a Rite-faith, sharing their Head of Faith with Catholicism</li>
<li>Reworked the Found Aragon decision to create Aragonese culture, be more frequent, and allow for slight varieties in Aragonese</li>
<li>Reworked the Avenge the Battle of Tours decision: it now shifts Aquitaine under the De Jure of Hispania when taken as it’s hard to accomplish.</li>
<li>Reworked the Form Portugal Decision: it can now be taken during the opportunity phase of the Struggle without being independent.</li>
<li>Added new special contracts for Clans: Marriage Favor, Jizya, Iqta, and Ghazi</li>
<li>Added a new faction type: the Dissolution faction will destroy the primary titles of their target, removing a Realm from the map</li>
<li>Added a new 867 Bookmark for Iberia: play one of the influential vassals and forge the destiny of your dynasty!</li>
<li>Added a dozen of new emblems for Coat of Arms and new patterns for Iberian cultures</li>
<li>Added a new field “Face item” for the Barbershop to, well, customize the character’s face</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the DLC is priced around $6.99 / £5.19 / €6.99.</p>

<li>Published the source code to a variant of the NVIDIA Linux kernel modules dual-licensed as MIT/GPLv2. The source is available here:<br/>
	https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules<br/>
	and will be updated each driver release. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier Vulkan extensions. To use this functionality, the nvidia-drm kernel module must be loaded with DRM KMS mode setting enabled. See the DRM KMS section of the README for guidance on enabling mode setting.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-suspend.service, nvidia-resume.service, and nvidia-hibernate.service to use WantedBy= rather than RequiredBy= dependencies for systemd-suspend.service and systemd-hibernate.service. This avoids a problem where suspend or hibernate fails if the NVIDIA driver is uninstalled without disabling these services first.<br/>
	See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21991<br/>
	If these services were manually enabled, it may be necessary to update their dependencies by running<br/>
	sudo systemctl reenable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-hibernate.service</li>
<li>Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance of the quit dialog was thus also removed.</li>
<li>Removed the warning message about mismatches between the compiler used to build the Linux kernel and the compiler used to build the NVIDIA kernel modules from nvidia-installer. Modern compilers are less likely to cause problems when this type of mismatch occurs, and it has become common in many distributions to build the Linux kernel with a different compiler than the default system compiler.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to skip test-loading the kernel modules on systems where no supported NVIDIA GPUs are detected.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to avoid a race condition which could cause the kernel module test load to fail due to udev automatically loading kernel modules left over from an existing NVIDIA driver installation. This failure resulted in an installation error message "Kernel module load error: File exists".</li>
<li>Updated the RTD3 Video Memory Utilization Threshold (NVreg_DynamicPowerManagementVideoMemoryThreshold) maximum value from 200 MB to 1024 MB.</li>
<li>Improved performance of GLX and Vulkan applications running in gamescope.</li>
<li>Added a "kernelopen" feature tag to the supported-gpus.json file, to indicate which GPUs are compatible with open-gpu-kernel-modules.</li>
<li>Improved Vulkan swapchain creation failure reporting. Applications can use the VK_EXT_debug_utils extension to receive additional information when an error was encountered in vkCreateSwapchainKHR().</li>
<li>Added a new configuration option for NVIDIA NGX to allow disabling the DSO signature check. See the "NGX" chapter of the README for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HDMI audio output was not working in some cases, especially with high display refresh rates (120Hz, 100Hz, etc.) using Fixed Rate Link (FRL) transmission mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be fantastic once <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> works fully with NVIDIA, as it's one of the absolutely most useful projects around. Used by the Steam Deck, it fully controls the window for games so they don't mess with your system at all. Great for multi-monitor uses too, as lots of games like to misbehave. It also provides some added extras to allow you to control scaling, add in FSR and more. This driver is another step towards it.</p>

      <title>In the relaxing sim Sprout Valley you&#39;re a cute cat farming a tiny island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sprout Valley looks quite sweet. A game where you play as Nico, a cute cat that has stepped away from their busy life to clean up a tiny island and create a nice farm. One I missed that had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zefrost/sprout-valley-chill-and-relaxing-experience" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> that finished earlier this month.</p>
<p>It's like a mini accessible animal-based Stardew Valley. You plant and water your crops, collect resources and sell them to keep progressing. There's a dynamic weather system, which the developer said will add-in some additional mechanics to the game too. What really makes it interesting is that each island is procedurally generated with a seed system, so you can play through the game an endless amount of times and share world seeds with others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ecUjzb5D4T0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d6a0253213e77f05ea30e1560e74f06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ecUjzb5D4T0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said it will also feature an events system, a full storyline, foraging, fishing, multiple islands, a quest system, an upgrades system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Looks like one we're going to need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>You can try out the experimental builds from <a href="https://zefrost.itch.io/sprout-valley" target="_blank">itch.io</a> right now and wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964820/Sprout_Valley/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Made with Godot Engine, it offers Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crystal Project is a wonderful new RPG you need to pick up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic JRPGs? Final Fantasy? Or anything like it? Well, Crystal Project released recently from developer Andrew Willman and it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>It arrived on Steam back at the end of March, which somehow I missed actually covering even though I have been playing it and enjoying it thoroughly. Bringing back fond memories of playing through some classics on Game Boy Advance it really does scratch the itch for some adventuring and exploration. Seems most players on Steam agree too, with it seeing a Very Positive rating and the developer has a Native Linux build too that seems to work to perfection.</p>
<p>There's two things that really pull you in with Crystal Project. The first being the graphics with it mixing in flat-looking pixel characters in a 3D world that resembles Minecraft / Minecraft Dungeons in the presentation. Then there's the non-linear nature to it, as you're free to explore at your own pace and do what you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rr3T1Kdhtiw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d9d754ea4ab9e3b28de7638183aa7ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rr3T1Kdhtiw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No random encounters!</li>
<li>Manage Threat to control which party member a monster will attack.</li>
<li>No hidden information. Preview turn order, damage, and probabilities like in TRPGs.</li>
<li>Discover and unlock new classes.</li>
<li>Assign sub-classes, pick passive abilities, and equip all kinds of special items.</li>
<li>Invent unique team compositions, or stick to the MMORPG Holy Trinity.</li>
<li>No permanent missables!</li>
<li>Seamless transitions between zones with no loading screens anywhere.</li>
<li>Uncover the mysteries of the world all on your own.</li>
<li>Metroidvania-style progression.</li>
<li>No invisible walls! Try to jump and climb anywhere you want.</li>
<li>Overcome platforming challenges to discover neat loot... and other stuff.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version of the game. Absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>You can buy Crystal Project on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637730/Crystal_Project/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ROTA is a cute and colourful gravity-bending puzzle-platformer worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It might look colourful and inviting but don't let that fool you, ROTA is going to test your brain with its gravity-defying puzzle mechanics.</p>
<p>As you walk over the edge of each section, you begin to rotate gravity and then use pushing, pulling and rotating mechanics with blocks to get through each stage and solve the puzzles. Gravity affects the blocks you use too, and you need to position them in the right place to get over various obstacles.</p>
<p>It's simple and effective but the developer was pretty creative with the setting to the point that it will keep you interested, while also make you scratch your head a few times with the added challenging of collecting all the gems. If you love puzzle-platformers, it's definitely one you need to take a look at.</p>

      <title>SCS put the Heart of Russia DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 on hold for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software have put out a statement about the Heart of Russia upcoming DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and they've decided not to release it. With the ongoing barbaric invasion of Ukraine from Russia, it's not exactly surprising that releasing a DLC expansion for a game that's focused on Russia might cause problems.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/05/heart-of-russia-dlc-statement.html" target="_blank">statement</a>, SCS mentioned how they "try to be as apolitical as possible" but in this case, they simply could not stay silent on it "with so many people suffering, we decided to refrain from releasing the DLC so that it is not perceived in any way as being in support of or tolerance of the aggression".</p>
<p>Sounds like it's not completely cancelled though, as they will hold onto it until Ukraine can "rebuild and heal" so they will then "endeavour to find a way for our Heart of Russia DLC to play whatever part it can in that healing process, for everyone".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20980082261653929649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A tough situation for SCS to navigate through, considering all the effort they put into their work and their DLC are usually quite well received too due to the work they put in to capture the essence of the areas they add in.</p>
<p>You can buy ETS2 from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/euro-truck-simulator-2?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Indie classic Super Hexagon gets a big free Neo update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Hexagon, a true indie gem classic from Terry Cavanagh has a big update out now and it has also become Steam Deck Verified with it. Previously available in Beta, it's now in the Stable branch for all players.</p>
<p>While the gameplay is the same, a lot of the tech behind the game was rewritten to perform better, along with much improved gamepad / controller support. This is only the start too, with a Part 2 coming at some point that has also been teased. Developer Ethan Lee wrote some comments about the work involved on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1531298835368005632" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and you can see the <a href="https://superhexagon.com/neo/" target="_blank">Neo update page</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>This should keep the game running smoothly on all platforms for a long time to come.</p>
<p>You can buy it in many places like <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/super-hexagon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/super-hexagon" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/super_hexagon?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>The QuickLaunch plugin for the Steam Deck is a great time-saver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck you can install various third-party games and applications in desktop mode. However, it's a bit annoying adding them all to Steam and so the QuickLaunch plugin can save you some time.</p>
<p>Making great use of the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a>, this <a href="https://github.com/Fisch03/SDH-QuickLaunch" target="_blank">QuickLaunch</a> plugin gives you a list in the Quick Launch menu of all your installed Flatpak applications on the Steam Deck (those you install via the Discover software store). Simple brilliance. No need to add each individually to Steam, no need for another app to keep adding them when you install something new, just an always up to date list via a plugin.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3pqt6ANcDA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9955c271a58d4ed71e36bdb3e702a76c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3pqt6ANcDA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's various other plugins <a href="https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/" target="_blank">available</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerTools - for even more performance tweaks.</li>
<li>SDH-Bluetooth - quickly connect to an already paired bluetooth device.</li>
<li>Mopidy-Controller - controller for the Mopidy music server, with tile view, tracklist view and playlist picker.</li>
<li>spdck - spotify controls</li>
<li>+ plenty more appearing</li>

      <title>Survival game Rust might be playable properly on Linux and Steam Deck soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rust, the massively popular and quite brutal survival game from Facepunch Studios is working towards Easy Anti-Cheat support for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>This has been a long-time coming, as they previously removed support for their Native Linux build but confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/garry-newman-of-facepunch-mentions-working-with-eac-for-rust-on-linux-with-proton/" target="_blank">back in July of 2021</a> that they were working on getting it running properly for the Steam Deck. In a fresh update reply to a user on Twitter asking about Easy Anti-Cheat, Facepunch head Garry Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1531235676653510657" target="_blank">mentioned</a> how "They're working on it, maybe next month if it turns out to be stable enough".</p>
<p>Good news for fans of Rust and Linux / Steam Deck, considering it is still one of the most popular games on Steam and has remained so for years.</p>

Defeat rivals, conquer tournaments, build relationships, and uncover a strange arcade conspiracy as your team walks the road to victory!"</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets more Steam Deck and Flatpak improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for Epic Games and GOG on Linux and Steam Deck has a new update out, mostly focused on cleaning up some problems but also sprinkles in some new features like a command-line interface.</p>
<p>This free and open source app has quickly become the go-to for running any games on Linux from Epic and GOG. especially as neither of them offer an official Linux client.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Version 2.3.4 Main Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a CLI parameter <code class="inline-code">--no-gui</code> that opens Heroic with no user interface. Might get in handy to create some scripts or add a Heroic game on other launchers. Basically, you just need to call <code class="inline-code">heroic --no-gui heroic://launch/{appName}</code>.</li>
<li>Added more feedback on errors and fixed some error messages that were not exactly clear.</li>
<li>Now it's possible to pass any wrappers on the Environmental Variable sections. Might be good to some advanced users.</li>
<li>[Linux] Heroic now will search for Proton versions and Runtimes outside the main library, so in any other drive or partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Several fixes related to the Steam runtime and Proton.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes Force Download and Force Upload of Cloud saves not working properly.</li>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Fix Winetricks on Flatpak/SteamDeck for good now.</li>
<li>[General] Fix GOG games not running the setup correctly;</li>
<li>[Linux/Mac] Fix the Windows version of a native GOG game not working properly</li>
<li>[macOS] Heroic will check if the crossover bottle exists before launching now.</li>
<li>[macOS] Fix Installing games on the folder with spaces.</li>
<li>[General] Library Refresh now will refresh only that specific library, making it more responsive.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes some styling issues across the settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Shortly after version 2.3.5 landed with these adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable most verbosity since several dialogs with false positives were being shown.</li>
<li>Fix corrupted config message on Windows.</li>
<li>Fix Library is not showing after log in with epic games.</li>
<li>Disabled auto-update on macOS</li>
</ul>

      <title>Crazy rogue-lite &#39;Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS&#39; adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for trying out a new rogue-lite that looks completely bizarre? Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS looks pretty hilarious and now it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Not only does it look completely insane, the developer's description of the game is equally ridiculous that doesn't really tell you too much about the game. The developer says "What sets Wally the game apart is it's attitude. Wally is the weird kid in middle school who Naruto runs in between classes. It's weird, wholesome and confident in itself. It's that confidence that is omni-present in pretty much every part of the game. It's also not afraid of going to extremes in order to make a point or to make a good joke!" — okay then.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s1C92vDVUwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7432359d329a1337cf3293feac3ec570.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s1C92vDVUwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Twists</strong>, These Daily/Weekly runs we introduce crazy twists every day! Start one daily run with maximum movement speed or start a run over encumbered with bombs. Compete with 600+ members of our discord community!</li>
<li>Local <strong>COOP </strong>which means you only need one copy of Wally to enjoy with a friend!</li>
<li>10 <strong>Dungeons</strong></li>
<li><strong>150+</strong> different Upgrades/Curses/Weapons/Quests/Daily Twists. With so many stack able passives interacting with each other it'll take years to see every combination.</li>
<li>5 Single Player Run types</li>
<li>5 Boss fights that will make you say, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT</li>
<li>Branching paths, get as greedy as much as you want, do you want to trade all your max health and become a glass cannon? Why the heck not!</li>
<li>True Ending, (It's a mystery to everyone what it is)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Have to admit though, it does look and sound <u>really</u> good. Seems it also went quite unnoticed with the original release in 2019, with only 129 Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1077450/view/3308469454281066650" target="_blank">announcement</a> about the Linux version the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS now has native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Oh, also Steam Auto Cloud saves (set up to be cross-platform) and even Steam Input.</p>
<p>These changes should allow for a smooth Steam Deck experience right out of the box, such as savedata syncing between your main machine and your Deck and also easy control rebinding.</p>
<p>As for now, we don't have a "Steam Deck Verified" rating, but the Linux build has been tested to work on Ubuntu 64-Bit LTS releases.</p>
<p>If anything, tell your Deck to run the default Linux build.</p>
<p>To prevent any odd-looking behavior, the Linux version will always start in fullscreen if it's in Big Picture or Deck mode by default, even if you've synced savedata with your main machine.</p>

      <title>Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ comes to PC, works on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SEGA decide to drop out of nowhere Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/Hatsune_Miku_Project_DIVA_Mega_Mix/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The good news is that thanks to Proton, it works out of the box on Linux and Steam Deck. A very popular rhythm game series, so to see it arrive on PC is awesome. Not that I'm any good at it mind you, or that I've ever personally played one in the series before but I tried it for science.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><u><strong>Over 170 Songs</strong></u> - Project DIVA debuts on PC with over 170 playable songs, each accompanied by a unique music video. Get into classics like “Melt” and “Cendrillon” plus new favorites like “Catch The Wave”!</li>
<li><u><strong>Endless Customization</strong></u> - Dress Miku and friends from head to toe in over 500 dazzling hairstyles, costumes, and accessories. Costumes can be tailored to every music video, making for endless possibilities.</li>
<li><strong><u>Swap Visual Styles in One Click</u></strong> - Switch between two visual styles for different experiences. Enjoy the pop of the “Mega Mix” style or the gloss of the high-fidelity “Future Tone” style, and change it up anytime.</li>
<li><u><strong>Custom T-Shirt Editor</strong></u> - Let Miku kickstart your fashion designer career on the big stage! Draw your own T-shirt from front to back, then debut it in a performance.</li>
<li><u><strong>Custom Playlists</strong></u> - You’re the director of this concert! Curate a playlist to perfection, hit play, and let the customized music videos roll in this cinematic experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a little look at it running directly on a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1rrtWUKo36A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f61d96ea4c81dad2e5b8c7cbe43a7a48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1rrtWUKo36A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I might be terrible at it but hey it works well and looks great.</em></p>
<p>Also tested it running just fine on my Fedora 36 desktop, both tested with Proton 7 and no issues encountered. Overall it seems like the Windows port running through Proton is looking really good, so clearly the developer did well and hopefully more will come to PC in future.</p>

      <title>Modern twin-stick cave-flyer &#39;Gravity Ace&#39; is out now and it&#39;s great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days when games were a lot simpler, and you had various attempts at cave-flying? Well, I do and the new release Gravity Ace brings back some fun memories while making a modern spin.</p>
<p>A love letter to the likes of  Thrust and Gravitar, Gravity Ace has you pilot a ship through tight corridoors and avoid various obstacles and enemies. It's slick and it looks pretty great too with it's sort-of messy pixel-art style with lots of vibrant colours and effects going on. This isn't just a standard gravity-fighting 2D game though, as it's also a twin-stick shooter and a pretty good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="89GQepJgNUA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d16d24610a52c30d85dccf8ac94c97d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/89GQepJgNUA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite challenging actually, since it makes heavy use of physics simulation. Everything that can move uses the physics engine, so you really have to watch out. Boost too fast at the wrong moment and you're done for. There's also a built-in level editor so you can make your own levels and full campaigns, along with being able to share them with others.</p>
<p>While the type of gameplay it offers is very much a small niche now since games have moved onto so many different genres and styles, Gravity Ace should be top of your list if this is the type of game you want to play. Not just for nostalgia but because it's a good arcade-like experience.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003860/Gravity_Ace/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://jotson.itch.io/gravity" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Get some classics working better on Steam Deck with Luxtorpeda upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a Steam Play tool (like Proton) but for running various Native Linux games engines. A fresh update is out, further improving Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>If you want to play some classics like Morrowind with OpenMW, X-COM: UFO Defense with openXcom, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 with OpenRCT2 (and <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">many more</a>) — Luxtorpeda is your friend. You would set Luxtorpeda as the Steam Play compatibility tool for those example games, and it then does the magic for you of downloading the Native Linux game engines for them, useful if those game engines are more up to date for modern systems and enhancements (which they usually are).</p>
<p>For the latest update here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade dependencies and code cleanup</li>
<li>Add logging to file if <code class="inline-code">LUX_WRITE_LOGGING=1</code> is set. The log will be written to <code class="inline-code">~/.local/state/luxtorpeda/luxtorpeda.log</code></li>
<li>Remove Steam Controller direct connection logic, relying on steam input instead. Steam Controller will still work in keyboard/mouse simulation mode. This makes it easier to maintain along with the steam deck support</li>
<li>Added support for Steam Deck gamepad controls. Gamepad support relies on the steam input settings. If steam input for the game is set as a gamepad, then will show controller icons and work as a controller. Otherwise, can use the touchscreen as a mouse</li>
<li>Detect if running on steam deck and set <code class="inline-code">LUX_STEAM_DECK=1</code> environment variable</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So now, if you have a game in Steam Input set to gamepad, it will actually detect that properly and allow you to use the gamepad prompts for the Luxtorpeda downloading and configuration UI in Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck thanks to this.</p>
<p>On top of that, the developer has been going through what games and game engines are supported, to give them some default configurations (like screen resolution) for the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Valve say they will look into fixing up the bot problems in Team Fortress 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, after multiple years of problems, Valve seem to be getting back on the horse for Team Fortress 2 development to deal with the big bot problem.</p>
<p>All across Twitter recently there's been a big storm from TF2 fans about the issue, as Valve has seemingly ignored it for quite some time now. It was getting hard to come across posts about anything to do with Steam and Valve that didn't have players complaining about it. Rightly so, it's a huge problem, bots have been ruining the game.</p>
<p>Valve took to Twitter to the official TF2 account to say <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__e7agx3km9ot" lang="en">TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the first Twitter post from the TF2 team in years, and the official TF2 website hasn't said anything about the issues.</p>
<p>Considering TF2 is one of the games that helped to push Steam's popularity, and continues to this day being one of the most popular games on Steam, hopefully Valve really will actually solve it this time. They tried a few times across 2020 and 2021 to deal with it, but all they did is slow the bots down for a while and they all came back in force.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.2 out for Steam Deck — better fan curves, refresh rate switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a huge Stable update for SteamOS with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3297210455204145216" target="_blank">version 3.2</a> now available for updating on your Steam Deck. Here's what's new. A lot of this isn't exactly new-news, since it's pushing out most of the changes from the Beta you could opt into at any point. </p>
<p>SteamOS 3.2 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an OS-controlled fan curve to improve the experience in low usage scenarios, and adjusting how the fan responds to different scenarios and temperatures.
	<ul>
<li>The old version of the fan curve is still available, and can be turned on in Settings &gt; System</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for changing the in-game screen refresh rate. The refresh rate will automatically be adjusted to the desired option when going in and out of game.
	<ul>
<li>There is a new slider in the Quick Access Menu &gt; Performance tab that allows you to choose a screen refresh rate between 40-60Hz</li>
<li>The framerate limit slider values will update accordingly, and will include 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, or uncapped framerate options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with typing the € key using the Steam keyboard</li>
<li>Performance HUD now shows a more accurate reading of VRAM used (previously would cap out at 1G used)</li>
<li>Added more internal screen resolution options for games to choose from</li>
<li>Fixed gain staging, resulting in higher max speaker volume, and removes white noise coming through 3.5mm jack with some headphones.</li>
<li>Fixed PipeWire and Steam failing to elevate their thread priorities</li>
<li>Fixed the language dropdown in the Warframe launcher</li>
<li>microSD card formatting process now performs a quick format</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally though, there's also the Steam Deck Client update that came along with it. This includes now full and proper support for Remote Play Together. So you will be able to host and join games using that feature. As a reminder, it allows one person who owns a game to let others join, who get it streamed from the host.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a notification if the Steam Deck SSD hits below 2GB space, you can name controller layout commands, you can connect to hidden wireless networks, there's icons for gamepad and mouse commands shown on in-game virtual menus and even the ability to close a window if the game / app you're running has more than one visible (an update to the window-switcher).</p>
<p>The fan changes really are the biggest thing here though. One of the fans the Steam Deck ships with is far louder than the other, with a high-pitch that comes with it. This new fan curve is massively quieter and just makes the experience so much nicer overall.</p>
<p>Second being the refresh rate switching, not to be confused with dynamic refresh rate, as this allows you to switch to a specific-set refresh rate like 40Hz. As Valve explained on that part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So 30hz = 33.33 ms/frame, and 60hz = 16.66ms/frame. Meanwhile, 40hz is 25 ms/frame. So while it might seem a bit counter intuitive, 40fps is exactly half-way between 30 fps and 60 fps in terms of update speed, and as such looks and feels far more responsive than 30fps. Generally speaking you always want a very stable frame pacing. So having a rock solid 40hz is better than oscillating between 42 and 48 hz, especially if your screen refresh is 60hz. This is because you're only actually getting a new frame each 1/60th of a second, so every time you miss, you get a double frame, leading to judder.</p>
<p>So a rock solid 40fps in game, with a 40hz updating screen, means every frame is a new frame and as a result it can feel smoother than an inconsistent framerate with a higher screen refresh. In addition, locking framerate lower puts less demand on the system and thus saves battery. While 40hz will use more battery than 30hz, it will use less than a game capped at a higher refresh, while still giving a subjectively far higher quality of an experience comparitively.</p>

      <title>Beautiful musical puzzle-adventure Sonority is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Musical puzzle-adventure game Sonority is out now from Hanging Gardens Interactive and Application Systems Heidelberg. I took a look so you know what to expect. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>Set in a world where music is magic, you set off on a journey to help heal a friend and use the power of music to overcome many obstacles in your way. Here's the thing — I'm completely terrible at having any kind of rhythm, and musically I don't have the tiniest bit of talent, so I had no idea what to expect from such a musical adventure. The developers said that "no previous musical knowledge necessary", so I really put it to the test and thankfully it wasn't overly confusing, relatively simple but still beautiful in the presentation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efu8HLs9-fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9299f29b9f8246c83ace8423afe15890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efu8HLs9-fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you go through the game you explore different areas, each having a few different sets of puzzles. A lot of it is about moving blocks around to access other areas, or to bring down barriers. You do this by collecting and then playing various notes on a pan flute while you're next to various stones that capture the note — then you run the puzzle sequence and see what happens. You can do each puzzle as many times as you like, until you get it right.</p>
<p>The notes are simple to play too, as it's just one-note per-key and you can pick between using letters or numbers on keyboard and they're spread across various buttons on a gamepad. Although the notes at the bottom of the screen don't show gamepad prompts, which was a little troublesome.</p>
<p>While a puzzle sequence is playing, you need to keep an eye on what moves with each note. It's all logical and well thought-out.  Just a little concentration and listening is all that's needed, so there's no real frustration involved, it's all thoroughly peaceful and enjoyable although there's a few tricky puzzles that stumped me for a while on getting the notes in the right order when multiple things were moving.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13744843101653597783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13744843101653597783gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A bit quirky with the story, that sees you follow a Racoon that's friends with a weird stone head that can't quite believe you can understand them. Touching though, all about helping out a friend.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interesting new puzzle mechanic based on melodies. (Simple note sequences develop into small melodies and then into complex pieces of music.)</li>
<li>A touching story about Esther and an old, oddball raccoon and his singing stone friends.</li>
<li>A lovingly designed, cohesive 3D game world with varied locations.</li>
<li>Atmospheric, extensive soundtrack with English and German versions of original songs.</li>
<li>Play with keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You also get full voice-over in both English and German, with text available for: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>It's also Steam Deck <em>Playable</em>, mainly due to some text being a little too small. Hopefully the developer can tweak that to make it properly Verified. Overall, a great puzzle game with a lovely atmosphere that works great on Linux.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sonority?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432390/Sonority/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>CRSED: F.O.A.D. is like PUBG with powers, now on Linux and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We may not have PUBG supported on Linux / Steam Deck yet but we do now have CRSED: F.O.A.D. (previously called Cuisine Royale), a Battle Royale game that looks quite a bit like PUBG but sprinkles in some powers.</p>
<p>At some point, the developer put up a Native Linux version and it has also now been Steam Deck Verified with the <a href="https://crsed.net/en/news/show/449-crsed-is-now-officially-supported-by-steam-deck/#!/" target="_blank">announcement</a> being official earlier this month. So if you've been after another BR game, perhaps this might be it? Although it doesn't have a big playerbase, it's active enough that finding a game so far hasn't been a problem. Seems mildly amusing too.</p>
<p>Here's how it runs on my Fedora Linux desktop followed by Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kPSoYc-23nI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/228a8aa5ff6cf4236c5e0ee801c46685.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kPSoYc-23nI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's close to perfection. Once they fix up some of the lighting issues, it would be quite great.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Massive and dense PvP battles: dozens of players begin their trip in one of the four picturesque and detailed locations, fighting their way to the centre of the battlefield. All the while, the battlefield itself shrinks constantly, surrounded by the deadly Dark Zone.</li>
<li>Different champions to select - each one with a unique superpower.</li>
<li>A constantly growing collection of realistically modelled weapons and armor, including anti-materiel guns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and mortars. There are few compromises in the game regarding physics or ballistics rules. Different vehicles, military amphibians and speed boats will help to cover distances.</li>
<li>Use mystical powers! Draw seals with your blood or conduct ancient rituals, throw hex bags at enemies and use your own special power. You can flood the whole map or cause the sun to eclipse, set up traps, summon zombies or teleport yourself or others the hell out of here. But first, one needs to collect sinner souls for killing enemies - to be able to pay for most of that luxury.</li>
<li>Stand out from the crowd with different costumes, masks, talismans, hats, gestures, graffiti and even underwear! Unlock new spirit-guardians to get additional tactical abilities in the battles.</li>
<li>Regular special events with new rules and setups of battles and a system of daily tasks and secret missions rewarding players with unique items and powers.</li>
<li>Fair play TPV: you can play in first or third person view. In order to mitigate any advantage of the latter, every player has a familiar with a camera that can uncover the position of a player who is peeking around a corner. So if you see a butterfly or a drone - you should know that you are being watched.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On my desktop with two monitors, one annoying quirk it had when first loading was the resolution stretching across both. A quick change in the settings and now it's looking pretty good, and it performs well too. The game is even using the Vulkan API on Linux.</p>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/884660/CRSED_FOAD/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Morrowind gets shiny in OpenMW with post-processing shaders coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenMW, the free and open source game engine reimplementation of Morrowind is about to get a lot better looking, with post-processing shaders coming in the next release.</p>
<p>This is a huge advancement for OpenMW, and will continue making it the absolute best way to play Morrowind on modern systems. Unlike modern games, Morrowind doesn't have lots of fancy graphical effects with shaders and OpenMW is fixing that for the upcoming 0.48.0 release.</p>
<p>Not in their recent <a href="https://openmw.org/2022/shiny-new-things-are-coming/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they mentioned "Cody Glassman aka wazabear finally added <a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/merge_requests/1124" target="_blank">post-processing shaders</a> to OpenMW. This is probably the biggest graphical enhancement for OpenMW since the implementation of real-time shadows. Modded OpenMW setups will now be able to take a huge step forward in time when it comes to graphic effects." and that sounds <em>very</em> exciting.</p>

      <title>Serious Sam 4 gets Steam Deck support with a small but &#39;notable&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Serious Sam 4 gained a Steam Deck Verified rating recently, which is in part thanks to the developer pushing out a small but significant patch for the game. It was listed in the recent post on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-hits-over-3000-games-either-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">Steam Deck hitting 3,000 titles</a> either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>While it's not a Native Linux version like their previous titles, seeing another developer actively support their game in Proton to give a good experience on Linux and Steam Deck is great.</p>
<p>In the recent patch notes the developer stated: "Hey everyone! As you have noticed we released a small, but notable update for Serious Sam 4. The update is focused on performance and game stability, new GPU support and most importantly the game now has a Steam Deck support".</p>
<p>How does it run on Steam Deck though? Let's take a quick look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KkuTlVzvzQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a59d866609fb331da45277c8bb1a030c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KkuTlVzvzQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In short: not great. Playable but frequent hard-drops down, even below 30FPS at times and the frame timing is messy. Seems they still have plenty of work to do on optimizing Serious Sam 4.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/serious-sam-4?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257420/Serious_Sam_4/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Battle of Polytopia gets a huge diplomacy update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Battle of Polytopia, a very highly rated turn-based strategy game that hopped over from mobile to PC back in 2020 is still expanding with a whole new diplomacy mechanic. Now you don't have to just expand and wage war, you can actually do a little more in the game and strategize with others.</p>
<p>Expanding the tech tree along with the diplomacy options, here's what was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Peace Treaties - Become friends with former enemies…until one of you calls it quits. Teammates cannot attack one another and can share roads.</li>
<li>Tribe Relations - With Tribe Relations systems, players can evaluate which tribe they can become friends with. Colored bubbles offer detailed explanations of what the tribes think of them.</li>
<li>Capital Vision - View the location of the Capital City of any tribe you’ve encountered. Capital Vision will also take effect when players meet someone new, thus aiding them in making tactical decisions.</li>
<li>Embassies - Diplomatic buildings which can only be built in other tribes' capitals when players are not at war with them. Embassies reveal the surrounding eight tiles and provide monetary rewards every turn, with greater rewards between allies.</li>
<li>Cloaks - These infiltration specialists are trained in the arts of subterfuge and clandestine operations and arrive armed with two new abilities: Stealth and Infiltrate. Cloaks are invisible to enemy units until they perform an action, and using them to infiltrate a city will create a horde of Daggers!</li>
<li>Daggers - Rebels incited to action by the Cloak to attack an enemy city. Daggers are the ultimate surprise attack, guerrilla warfare units, meaning enemies won’t retaliate when they pounce.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a really great 4x strategy game with cross-platform multiplayer and single-player against the AI too. The Native Linux version last I checked worked great too. Trailer is below if you've not seen it, it's kind of like a cuter and smaller version of Civilization, great if you don't have endless hours to put in one more turn but still want a taste of the genre. A perfect entry-game into it.</p>

      <title>Super Animal Royale gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a Battle Royale for everything now of course and Super Animal Royale puts 64 furry things in an arena and makes them fight until the end. Oh, it also now has Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Released originally back in August 2021, the latest update to this free to play game just landed and the developer noted that "full Steam Deck compatibility has been implemented". Seems they needed to tweak text input for the virtual keyboard, plus a few quirks with controller support were solved. This should move it from a Playable to a Verified rating!</p>
<p>Playing it for a little bit myself, it's actually great fun. Although, some of the text on the Steam Deck screen is still just a little bit too small to be clear enough but you're not really doing much reading here, it's all about the action. Pretty standard Battle Royale mechanics though, just wrapped up in a furry coating.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2nUJC4kHp6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6c2ce2fdded42da44b9be50d3344f00.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2nUJC4kHp6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That said, I can easily see myself playing plenty more of this. Gives off that "just one more round" feeling when getting oh-so close to being number 1. A quality action game for breaks, in bed or just chilling on the sofa. Works great on a Linux desktop too thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Survival of the Fittest: Scavenge a variety of powerful weapons, armor and items to become the apex predator in intense 64-player online matches.</li>
<li>The Superest World: Explore a massive, beautifully illustrated 2D island and discover its hidden lore, by chatting with its inhabitants and scouring its rich environments for clues.</li>
<li>Different Stripes for Different Fights: Collect hundreds of animal breeds and customize them with thousands of cosmetic items, weapons, outfits, and even umbrellas!</li>
<li>Evolving Events &amp; Updates: Enjoy an endless stampede of new content, including seasonal outfits, animals, and weapons to collect.</li>
<li>The Fast and the Furriest: Flatten your foes while rolling dirty in a Hamster Ball, or mount a Giant Emu and peck your way to the promised land.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/843380/Super_Animal_Royale/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>. <em>While free it does have DLC for cosmetics and in-game purchases for cosmetics.</em></p>

      <title>Pixel-art people-sim Tiny Life adds gamepad support, works on Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's like The Sims but pixel-art and comes from an indie developer, what's not to love about this? Tiny Life has you take care of a family, build up their home and try not to kill them. First mentioned here <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/tiny-life-is-an-upcoming-pixel-art-take-on-experiences-like-the-sims/" target="_blank">back in January</a>, the developer has been steadily working away on it.</p>
<p>Celebrating two years in development, it has moved from Alpha to Beta and brings with it a bunch of big new features including full controller support, which I tested working quite nicely on the Steam Deck with the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>On top of that there's plenty of new content included in the latest build of the demo including cafes, a bunch of new furniture items, decorations and the list goes on. Plenty to keep your little pixel-family happy. There's also a new "foodie" personality type, newspapers to get jobs from, more speech sounds, control hints, children will now run around "for fun" plus an assortment of improvements and bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo gets a fresh demo and relaunched Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo is a thoroughly wonderful looking 3D adventure about a dead snake that wakes up in Limbo. Their first Kickstarter back in 2021 didn't do well but they've <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gallagames/kulebra-and-the-souls-of-limbo-relaunch" target="_blank">relaunched</a> with a new demo.</p>
<p>"Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo is a 3D adventure game where you’ll meet the many good and not-so-good folks of Limbo, a place where souls with deep regrets are cursed into repeating the same day on a loop. Use your wits and keen eye to gather clues from the residents and find items that will help you to breach the obstacles in your path one by one.</p>
<p>You play as Kulebra, a dead snake with a heart of gold that wakes up in Limbo. With his only lead being the words of a strange Old Lady, he embarks on a quest to find his purpose while sharing his light with the residents in hopes of helping them as well."</p>

<p>This time around their goal is much lower, and they've managed to successfully hit it. Bringing the goal down from $60,000 to $10,000 is a huge drop though, hopefully it will still result in a fun game overall. They certainly have a good looking game and it sounds like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore and interact with the world to gather clues and items that will help you open doors in your quest (figuratively and literally).</li>
<li>A game that will reward you for interacting with the world, paying attention to details, and connecting the dots.</li>
<li>Full of characters with their own quirks, side stories, and schedules that bring life to this world despite most of them being very dead.</li>
<li>An in-game <strong>day</strong>, <strong>dusk</strong>, and <strong>night</strong> cycle that will change the world and characters, ending with the curse that resets the souls of Limbo back to the start.</li>
<li>A notebook will keep track of important details for you, so you can't blame me if you weren't paying attention.</li>
<li>Confront the dark souls attempting to put out your light; Overcome their challenges that will test everything you’ve learned in this journey.</li>
<li>Bilingual! This game supports the <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Spanish</strong> languages.</li>
<li>A 1.5 to 2 hour-long fulfilling adventure (demo) with a beginning and end! (To be continued in the full release)</li>
<li>And many secrets are hidden away for you to find! (If you’re thorough, that is)</li>
</ul>

      <title>After a long wait, Psychonauts 2 has an official Linux version now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Psychonauts 2 was originally crowdfunded via Fig back in 2016, and now near a year after the Windows release the Native Linux version is now available. This comes along with an update that added more languages and fixed an issue with the Strike City checkpoint at the end of the level.</p>
<p>In the notes, they mentioned this about the Linux port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game may crash at launch or when attempting to alter Display settings such as Window Mode. Please try the following troubleshooting solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use alternate display drivers, found in Software &amp; Updates &gt; Additional Drivers</li>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; Appearance and reposition the Activities bar to the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>Use an alternate desktop environment (DE) such as Gnome on X.Org or Ubuntu on Wayland</li>
<li>Try changing the resolution with the "Resolution Scaling" slider found in the Settings &gt; Graphics menu</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Some pretty strange advice but that's what they said… </em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mBi9rqCZ4os"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54a71570fad68f61d431868605b8eb4b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mBi9rqCZ4os" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience an imaginative, cinematic story that mixes humor and intrigue, brought to you by legendary game designer Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango, Brütal Legend, Broken Age).</li>
<li>Explore unique environments using Raz’s ability to dive into people’s brains to battle their inner demons, unlock hidden memories, and resolve their emotional baggage.</li>
<li>Leap acrobatically through the air, traversing tightropes and trapezes in a varied, challenging, and joyful platforming experience.</li>
<li>Wield a powerful array of psychic powers to blast, burn and levitate things, or even slow down time itself to solve environmental puzzles and battle strange enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see it finally happen.</p>

      <title>Demo now up for high-speed future-combat racer FLASHOUT 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for high-speed explosive racing? FLASHOUT 3 was announced last month and dev Jujubee S.A.    has now put up a demo. The demo currently has one circuit (Star City), one ship and 3 types of weapons to try out and online leaderboards are hooked up too so you can take on the world.</p>
<p>Featuring incredibly vibrant neon-soaked graphics, FLASHOUT 3 brings with it ultra-fast ships, loops, jumps and sudden razor-sharp turns that can be a little tricky to manage while you're looking out for weapons firing from other racers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NiSL2s8E9Ig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fab21e027716ef5889bbc3cf1433cf70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NiSL2s8E9Ig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Linux Native demo seems to work just fine, with gamepad support also working nicely with my Xbox Series X pad, no trouble there at all which is a good sign for the full release at some point later this year. A little bit <em>too</em> fast for me personally (it felt really chaotic) but I'm sure some speed-demon readers will love a go at this.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>High-speed, unforgettable racing experience.</li>
<li>A powerful arsenal of weapons, boosts and upgrades at your disposal.</li>
<li>A large collection of destroyable race ships to choose from.</li>
<li>A variety of different race tracks and layouts.</li>
<li>Various game modes, including Career, Versus and more!</li>
<li>Stunning 3D Graphics.</li>
<li>High-beat electronic music.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow it and try the new demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761870/FLASHOUT_3/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fly Dangerous, the &#39;love letter&#39; to Elite Dangerous racing is now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love racing spaceships? Check out Fly Dangerous, originally created as a love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community, it's now available on Steam and it's free.</p>
<p>"Ever wanted to take a ridiculously fast, fully-controllable rocket ship and fly it like the lunatic that lives inside of all of us? Well now you can!</p>
<p>Fly Dangerous is a game where 60Gs of acceleration is just fine because who needs realism? Configure your flight stick (or mouse, keyboard, gamepad or ... steering wheel, no judgements here but good luck) and take to the skies at absurd speeds."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6107864651653403349gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6107864651653403349gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developer mentioned that it will remain free as "The top and bottom of it is this is a game I want to play and it's become a fun community project which stopped us going mad during a global pandemic. With this being a competitive / community-focused game at heart, the niche-within-a-niche nature means that the less barriers to entry, the better it will be for everyone." and they might look at ways people can support the game development in future.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4TDY9Co1pzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f513c6d39e6d1f47443b3dbf7f9f15b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4TDY9Co1pzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it currently has includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6dof flight model (and the ability to tweak it to your hearts content - yes, a 50km/s ship will break the game and that's on you).</li>
<li>An infinite game world engine to facilitate the rather absurd speeds (~1km/s is no joke when it comes to floating point accuracy!)</li>
<li>2 ships (yes, many more to come) with colour customisation.</li>
<li>All the infrastructure around game / graphics / audio options, re-bindable inputs, various flight assists and a frankly absurd amount of options to cater to all kinds of users from casual pad-play all the way to dual-flightstick pilots.</li>
<li>VR headset support (F11 to recenter!) - I'd love to do cockpit VR controller support in the future but it's not a priority right now.</li>
<li>Basic JSON map format with auto-leaderboard-generation (ripe for an integrated custom map tool in the future).</li>
<li>14 Time Trial maps - more are planned when there's more concrete level geometry and finalised terrain.</li>
<li>Infinite terrain gen as a technical preview (more diverse biome terrain and foliage planned).</li>
<li>Multiplayer as a technical preview (no competitive game modes as of yet).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lacuna – A Sci-Fi Noir Adventure now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lacuna – A Sci-Fi Noir Adventure is celebrating one year since release, and it seems they only needed to do one tiny fix to be fully Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>What is it? A classic-styled adventure that does away with "point &amp; click" instead going for more platformer-like controls and it really does look great. The developer also claims it has plenty of non-repeating conversations, story-driven mysteries, no pixel-hunting and "real" choices with multiple endings. Users on Steam appear to like it too with it having a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>It was previously rated as "Playable" on the Steam Deck because of one little issue: sometimes a mouse cursor would appear. So they patched that and now it's fully Steam Deck Verified. Pretty amazing how good Proton is to make Windows builds run so well on Linux and Steam Deck that developers might only need such a tiny patch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sWh4Fzv7vLE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc9ab369a3b47116c3f02c239ee06bf4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sWh4Fzv7vLE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The anniversary update also came with improvements to various gameplay elements, some UI cleaning, new artworks and bug fixes for the whole game.</p>
<p>Buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lacuna-a-scifi-noir-adventure?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364100/Lacuna__A_SciFi_Noir_Adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kingdoms and Castles has a huge AI Kingdoms update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's finally here! The huge AI Kingdoms update for Kingdoms and Castles has now landed, greatly expanding this wonderful city-builder with more strategy elements. Well, if you want them that is. You can still keep it as a mostly peaceful builder, as AI Kingdoms are optional.</p>
<p>You can chat with them, trade, fight and more but there's plenty of other improvements that came along with this update. There's also a fog of war visibility system, so you need to do a little exploration. If you're allied with another kingdom, you get to see what they see too. Sea gates to protect your harbours, a siege workshop which can create catapults, transport carts, a building integrity system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nXW9QInOBN4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/29eab58bd583dbd665a50cc8c86c45d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nXW9QInOBN4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A pretty amazing update really. Fun to watch this one evolve, as it was a tiny game when it first released.</p>
<p>You can find Kingdoms and Castles on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/569480/Kingdoms_and_Castles/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/kingdoms_castles?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://lionshield.itch.io/kingdoms-and-castles" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>V Rising now works on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton Experimental Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank">V Rising</a>, the latest huge Steam hit can now run on Linux desktops and Steam Deck, thanks to updates to the Beta version of Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>What is it? The latest survival game, all about rising as a vampire! Explore a vast world teeming with mythical horrors and danger. Travel through lush forests, open countryside, and dark caverns to discover valuable resources, meeting friends and foes alike along the way. Traverse the world with vampire comrades or hunt solo as you pillage villages, raid bandits, and delve into the domains of supernatural beasts.</p>
<p>It managed to climb the Steam leaderboards pretty rapidly, with it now being in the top-10 for concurrent users.</p>
<p>To get it working on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton Experimental you need the "bleeding-edge" Beta version. As a <em>warning</em> though, doing this will affect any game you have set to Proton Experimental and you should only use the bleeding-edge Beta until the fixes roll out into the main version of Proton Experimental to prevent any future issues.</p>
<p>Here's what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library</li>
<li>Go to it's Properties menu</li>
<li>Head to the Betas tab</li>
<li>Select "bleeding-edge" from the drop-down box</li>
<li>Now pick V Rising in your Steam Library</li>
<li>Go to its Properties menu</li>
<li>Select the Compatibility tab</li>
<li>Put a tick in the box and select Proton Experimental</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you will have V Rising working on Linux and Steam Deck. Some issues remain like videos not playing and you get a test-screen instead, which will eventually be solved. The actual gameplay works though.</p>
<p>Here's a little video of the steps for you:</p>

      <title>The official iFixit launch for Steam Deck parts and repair guides is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of an accidental early start <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/looks-like-ifixit-have-steam-deck-parts-available-now/" target="_blank">that was taken down</a>, iFixit have now actually properly launched their Steam Deck replacements parts and various guides for each part to fix or replace yourself.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck scored a 7/10 on their repairability score which they said is "very respectable" but there are certain issues, like the battery not being very accessible and the USB-C port being soldered right to the motherboard. See the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Steam_Deck" target="_blank">guides here</a> and the <a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/collections/game-console-parts?pf_t_manufacturer=Device+Manufacturer%3DValve&amp;pf_t_model=Model%3DSteam+Deck" target="_blank">components here</a>, plus see the iFixit <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/60131/how-valve-is-changing-game-console-design" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems there are still some parts that are missing including: the battery, audio board, touchpads, heatsink, all action buttons are missing including the D-pad, SSDs and the motherboard we saw before is also not available. So it's not yet the full thing but it's vastly better than what other vendors do.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh breakdown on the parts and prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right Trigger Button Assembly - £7.99 / $7.99</li>
<li>Left Trigger Button Assembly - £7.99 / $7.99</li>
<li>UK charger - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>EU charger - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>US charger $24.99</li>
<li>Screen Adhesive - £4.96 / $4.99</li>
<li>Battery Adhesive - £4.96 / $4.99</li>
<li>Front Plate - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Back Plate - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Right Bumper Button Assembly - £6.99 / $6.99</li>
<li>Left Bumper Button Assembly - £6.99 / $6.99</li>
<li>Speakers - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Steam Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99 / $4.99</li>
<li>D-pad Rubber Membrane - £4.99 / $4.99</li>
<li>Action Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99 / $4.99</li>
<li>Screen (64GB / 256GB) - From £59.99 / $64.99</li>
<li>512GB Anti-glare Screen - From £89.99 / $94.99</li>
<li>Fan - From £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Right Thumbstick - £24.99 / $19.99</li>
<li>Left Thumbstick - £24.99 / $19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of them actually correctly show up in their store list too, so it seems like they're still tweaking it. The thumbsticks for example don't actually show in the list for me right now, but their store pages are live and linked from inside the guides.</p>

      <title>Meg&#39;s Monster has you help a lost girl get home before she causes the apocalypse </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is quite a story. Meg's Monster is the next and biggest game so far from developer Odencat, where you need to help a lost little girl get home. The problem is, she has some awesome power and might just cause some kind of monster apocalypse.</p>
<p>"Meg’s Monster is a short, story-driven JRPG with a big twist. Players control Roy, who begins the game with 99,999 HP and is virtually untouchable—but the real concern is keeping Meg safe, because if she starts crying, it’s game over for everyone. Players will have to master the unique mechanics and mini-games baked into each battle, all while protecting Meg and using her favorite toys to keep her pacified."</p>
<p>Honestly this sounds hilarious and rather clever, can't wait to try it. The developer is promising a story that continues to expanding, into an emotional journey that "will remain in your heart for years to come".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Bonfire Peaks - Lost Memories announced, plus Photo Mode update out </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bonfire Peaks, one of the nicest puzzle games released in 2021 is getting an expansion in Lost Memories plus an update is out now with new features.</p>
<p>What is it? A block-pushing puzzle game created by Pipe Push Paradise and Hiding Spot developer Corey Martin, co-designed with Alan Hazelden, and with art by Mari Khaleghi and Zach Soares. It's absolutely gorgeous with the voxel-based world, and the developer said to expect no filler content — just great puzzles.</p>
<p>Firstly, the update that just landed has these features and fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Photo Mode!</li>
<li>Fixed several position rounding bugs at low framerates</li>
<li>Fixed several rotation-based bugs at low framerates</li>
<li>Minor edit to level "Moving Day"</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock in level "Bodyguard"</li>
<li>Minor mesh optimizations</li>
<li>Audio mix edits</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the expansion, it's a "trilogy of DLC" with Bonfire Peaks: Lost Memories and Chapter One will be available sometime in Q3 2022. Each chapter will have new puzzles and some new game mechanics too, so I'm thoroughly curious to see what they will sprinkle into it.</p>
<p>Have a look at the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d6rVGPZA7fg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d11a5a3a2deef643d463ff7ffa133d79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d6rVGPZA7fg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full game is currently available via <a href="https://coreymartin.itch.io/bonfire-peaks" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147890/Bonfire_Peaks/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh interview for you today, this time with Ken VanDine who is responsible for leading the way for Ubuntu on the desktop at Canonical. This will form part of a mini-series — the first already up with <a class="u-url" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/an-interview-with-aaron-honeycutt-from-system76/" target="_blank">Aaron Honeycutt from System76</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Can you first introduce yourself and tell us what you do?</p>
<p>"I’m Ken VanDine, leading the Ubuntu Desktop team at Canonical.  I’ve been here for over 13 years now, and working on the Linux desktop for well over 20 years."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: How did you get started with Linux and what attracted you to it?</p>
<p>"Curiosity… From the time I was a young child, I just had to know how things worked.  I would take my toys apart to figure out how they worked before ever playing with them.  As I got older, that translated into computer hardware, and soon after software.  I discovered Slackware Linux in 1993 and never looked back.  It was simply amazing to have access to the source code, seeing how it worked, and I quickly immersed myself into open source software as a means to quench my thirst for how software worked."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s it like to work for Canonical as the Ubuntu Engineering Manager? What’s your work setup like?</p>
<p>"Having the opportunity to work on the Ubuntu Desktop all these years has been quite the privilege, and really the highlight of my career.  During this time I’ve been able to work on many exciting projects and contribute in different ways.  Now I get to be more involved in setting direction and leading an amazing team of some of the best developers around, it really doesn’t get any better than this! "</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What projects are you directly involved with / working on right now for Ubuntu?</p>
<p>"I lead the overall development of the desktop, which includes the distro, enterprise desktop, WSL, developer experience, and gaming experience.  With the gaming experience team being the newest, I’m the primary driver for that until we staff that team."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10522949491653301034gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10522949491653301034gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</em></p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Does Canonical regularly speak to other businesses and developers, to try and get them to support Linux and Ubuntu?</p>
<p>"Certainly, we have relationships with many interesting companies, which is awesome.  And now that we’re starting to get involved in the gaming scene on Linux, we’ve found ourselves creating some more interesting partnerships."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Canonical recently announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/canonical-going-all-in-on-gaming-for-ubuntu-new-steam-snap-package-in-testing/" target="_blank">another push into gaming</a>. It seemed like Canonical and Ubuntu let things slide on that front — so why now?</p>
<p>"I would contest that we haven’t really let it slide.  For example, we’ve had long standing relationships with partners like NVidia to ensure users are able to easily use the best driver for their hardware.  But yes, we are upping our game, and getting involved in much deeper ways.  So why now?  Momentum… The landscape for gaming on Linux is improving, at a steadily increasing pace.  This momentum has sparked increased enthusiasm.  It’s the right time to increase our investment and help be a catalyst to continue to fuel that momentum.  Our engineers have the unique background to make a significant contribution to that growth, which we’ll all benefit from."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Going by various stats (like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam</a>), Ubuntu has been regularly falling as the main choice for Linux Gaming. With the likes of Arch and Manjaro pulling in a lot. Why do you think that is? Any more interesting plans to pull people back?</p>
<p>"I think this is primarily due to web searches done by users looking to solve various problems getting their games to work.  There is a wealth of information that leads to distros like Arch.  Our top priority will be to ensure users can get their games working without the need to consult those sites.  The next goal will be to improve the resources available to help users on Ubuntu when needed."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: So right now, why should someone go for Ubuntu over Pop, Manjaro, Arch, Fedora and others?</p>
<p>"Those are all fine distro choices, and people should choose what they are most comfortable with.  I’d say people should choose Ubuntu if their priority is a Linux desktop that just works.  We work hard to provide the best user experience possible, not only with the everyday desktop experience but also ease of access to the best drivers, bug and security fixes and out of the box access to the best selection of high quality applications.  And let’s not forget our certification program that ensures that many desktops and laptops are supported."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What are you particularly excited about for the future of Ubuntu?</p>
<p>"Dare I say the year of the Linux desktop?  Nah… Linux has reached a point where that can no longer be the goal post, we must look well beyond that.  I’m really excited about all the ways Ubuntu is meeting the daily challenges of so many use cases, ranging from robotics, IoT, cloud, to desktop deployments in large enterprises and home users playing video games.  Ubuntu is everywhere, and I’m really excited to be part of this journey."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: For all the critics of Snap packages, anything you wish to say to them?</p>
<p>"Ubuntu users aren’t the critics of snaps, and I’d argue that users are less concerned with how they get their applications.  Of course we have strong opinions on how to deliver high quality applications, in a secure and reliable way and it’s our mission to do just that.   We do hear what people say and we take the mission of providing the best possible experience very seriously, so we are always looking for legitimate ways to improve the platform."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Considering we have Flatpak, AppImage, deb, rpm and so on. What do you think about how fractured packaging is on Linux? Does Snap not add to the problems for developers?</p>
<p>"There is fragmentation, which isn’t surprising. I will say out of the packaging formats you mentioned, Snap is the only one that has really seen any success from ISVs.  There’s a reason why you see official snap support from major ISVs, but not the others.  Snap was one of the first packaging formats to address issues like sandboxing.  Other packaging formats following suit shows snap was on the right track.  The benefits of snap and the single source of truth store are must haves for any major vendor."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: One of the potential problems with Snap is that the server side is solely controlled by Canonical and is basically proprietary. Will this be opened up? Do you see it as an issue that needs sorting?</p>
<p>"Anyone can create an alternate store that supports snaps.  The API is completely open as is snapd.  Having a centralized store is actually one of the strengths of the ecosystem.  ISVs want that single trusted source for apps.  I think the tremendous success we’ve had with ISVs adopting snap is in no small part due to this concept.  And I ask, is it really a problem?  Snap is completely open, anyone can see what’s being executed on your system.  The internals of the store that handles metadata just isn’t interesting."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Are you buying a Steam Deck? What are your thoughts on what it means for Linux Gaming overall?</p>
<p>"I haven’t yet, I wish I had reserved one earlier.  It’s a great device, and Linux was the obvious OS choice for such a device.  Valve has done a fantastic job of pushing compatibility technologies to make Linux a viable platform.  All their work has really done wonders to bring more games to Linux and I look forward to seeing where that takes us."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s your own personal computing setup like?</p>
<p>"My primary system is a Thinkpad T14, with a couple of 24” displays attached via a USB-C dock.  But of course I have quite a bit of additional hardware necessary for development and testing."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What are your top 5 favourite games to play on Linux?</p>
<p>"Oh, that’s a tough one.  I’ve always been partial to racing games and really enjoy any of the Need for Speed games. I’ve also been really into Raft lately as well as playing LoL, Valheim and RDR2. I’m more of a creator than a gamer, however I do have a passion for enabling users to get the most out of their Linux desktop experience."</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal a list of issues with their driver and Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the situation has improved a little for NVIDIA and Wayland, they're not really there yet and so NVIDIA are now keeping a <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/wayland-information-for-r515-beta-release/214275" target="_blank">public list</a> of the issues split between drivers and either protocol or compositor limitations. This follows on from the huge splash they made recently with their new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">open source Linux GPU kernel modules</a>, which also improved Wayland support a little too with the 515.43.04 driver that went up at the same time.</p>
<p>NVIDIA said they expect the list to get shorter over time as "missing functionality is implemented both in the driver and in upstream components".</p>
<p>So for those interested, here's things as they stand right now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA DRIVER LIMITATIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The VDPAU library, used for hardware accelerated video decoding and presentation, does not have native Wayland support and does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NvFBC desktop capture library does not have native Wayland support and does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable display refresh rate capabilities such as G-Sync are not reported by nvidia-drm module, therefore this functionality is not available on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform, require support for DRM display leasing which does not currently work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EGL_EXT_platform_x11 is not supported with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-drm module does not support the GAMMA_LUT, DEGAMMA_LUT, CTM, COLOR_ENCODING, or COLOR_RANGE connector properties, which may impact some compositor features related to color correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-settings configuration tool has limited functionality on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Front-buffer rendering in GLX does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WAYLAND PROTOCOL OR COMPOSITOR LIMITATIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following workstation features are not supported by any Wayland compositors or the Wayland protocol. They will also likely require new EGL extensions or other means to expose the related hardware functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SLI and Multi-GPU Mosaic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frame Lock and Genlock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swap Groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend, pixel shift, and emulated YUV420.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereo rendering</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no established public API through which Wayland compositors can power off video memory via RTD3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xwayland does not provide a suitable mechanism for our driver to synchronize application rendering with presentation, which can cause visual corruption in some circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indirect GLX does not work with Xwayland because the Glamor rendering engine is not compatible with our EGL implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware overlays cannot be used by GLX applications with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD give more details on Ryzen 7000, Socket AM5 and &#39;Mendocino&#39; APU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Computex 2022 is now in full swing and AMD have done their presentation giving off some details on the upcoming  Ryzen 7000, Socket AM5 and 'Mendocino' APU. What we got was just a teaser for now though, since AMD will be saving their full detail announcement for later this year.</p>
<p>Based on the 5nm "Zen 4" architecture, Ryzen 7000 sounds pretty fancy. AMD say they will have double the amount of L2 cache per-core, with higher clock speeds, and they will have a "greater than" 15% uplift when it comes to single-threaded performance compared to the previous generation. During the keynote, they also showed off a pre-production unit doing 5.5 GHz in some testing and performing "30% faster" than an Intel Core i9 12900K in a Blender multi-threaded rendering workload.</p>
<p>You're going to want to save your pennies though, since Zen 4 will need the new socket AM5 but they will be compatible with AM4 coolers. For the first time, they're also putting the RDNA 2-based graphics engine into their main enthusiast Ryzen CPUs too. You also get support for DDR5 and PCI Express 5.0. Ryzen 7000 will be available "this Fall".</p>
<p>The AM5 series will have three different varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>X670 Extreme: Bringing the most connectivity and extreme overclocking capabilities with PCIe 5.0 support for two graphics slots and one storage slot</li>
<li>X670: Supporting enthusiast overclocking with PCIe 5.0 support on one storage slot with graphics support optional</li>
<li>B650: Designed for performance users with PCIe 5.0 storage support</li>
</ul>
<p>As for their new "Mendocino" APU based on Zen 2 (up to 4 cores / 8 threads) with RDNA 2 graphics that will be available in notebooks priced around $399-$699, launching sometime in the second half of this year. Interestingly, they directly mentioned Chromebooks for this too, so maybe some more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/" target="_blank">Steam on Chrome OS</a> fun with these.</p>
<p>You can see the full presentation below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BRtBB2VnF8M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ed0358bed4fcb0a418dbef9a4d17644.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BRtBB2VnF8M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"At Computex 2022 we highlighted growing adoption of AMD in ultrathin, gaming and commercial notebooks from the leading PC providers based on the leadership performance and battery life of our Ryzen 6000 series mobile processors," said Dr. Su. "With our upcoming AMD Ryzen 7000 Series desktop processors, we will bring even more leadership to the desktop market with our next-generation 5nm ‘Zen 4’ architecture and provide an unparalleled, high-performance computing experience for gamers and creators." </p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 3,000 games either Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There it is, the next big milestone for the Steam Deck has been hit with over 3,000 games now rated as either Verified or Playable. It's just a number of course, and there's far more you can actually play, this is just what Valve has formally put through Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Looking back that's over 500 since I last covered this when it hit around 2,500 back on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-hits-2500-games-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">May 4th</a>, the rate is quite impressive although it's still thoroughly random what goes through. A long way to go though of course considering how many games there are on Steam.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the latest numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1535 - Verified</li>
<li>1493 - Playable</li>
<li>1322 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the latest to be Verified or Playable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between the Stars (Playable)</li>
<li>Beyond a Steel Sky (Verified)</li>
<li>FAR: Lone Sails (Verified)</li>
<li>Serious Sam 4 (Verified)</li>
<li>Temtem (Verified)</li>
<li>Thumper (Verified)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the Steam Deck has now spent 5 weeks at the top of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2022W19/" target="_blank">Steam charts</a> when sorted by revenue (no way to view by units, Valve don't give that out). Nice to see it continue doing so well!</p>

      <title>APICO is a very relaxing beekeeping game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Native Linux support, APICO from TNgineers and Whitethorn Games might be one of my new favourite was just to chill-out. <u>Note</u>: key provided for me by their PR team.</p>
<p>With a sprinkle of facts and plenty of exploration, APICO filled me up with a sense of pride in what I was doing. Bees are awesome, the world revolves around them and in APICO it's your job to protect them all — and breed them. You've left the bright lights of the big city to go out in the sticks to help your poor old grandmother. Honestly this is one of the most wholesome games I've played so far this year. Cozy would be a really good way to describe it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4cQ8zFgCAWc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d1107c3807f0fa4fe3eb39fb7223b5dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4cQ8zFgCAWc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Live out your wildest beekeeping fantasies – sting free!</li>
<li>Unique crafting &amp; beekeeping minigames that drive gameplay progression</li>
<li>Cross-breed different bees to discover over 30 new species</li>
<li>Make and sell honey, Apicola, and other beekeeping products</li>
<li>Repopulate lost species and release them back into the wild</li>
<li>Multiple biomes to explore, each with their own unique bee species</li>
<li>Uncover the forgotten secrets of the APICO islands</li>
<li>Play together with friends in 4 player online co-op!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Note</u>: if it fails to run for you on Linux, simply set it to the Steam Linux Runtime in the Steam Compatibility settings. Game Maker still has a few issues with dependencies on Linux but the developer has most of them bundled with it so it works fine on Steam Deck and Ubuntu out of the box.</p>
<p>It gives off the same kind of zen feeling I got from the likes of Stardew Valley and Littlewood, it has that wonderful blend of exploration and building that allows you to just take a deep breath and smile while the hours tick away. An easy recommendation, great for any age.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“There was no better time to release APICO than on World Bee Day,” said Dr. Matthew White, CEO of Whitethorn Games. “We hope that everyone who plays the game will take its message about bee conservation to heart, and help bring more awareness to this important issue.”</p>
<p>“Our thanks goes out to Whitethorn Games and all the players who tried the demo and wishlisted the game for supporting our efforts,” said Ell, co-founder of TNgineers. “APICO is finally out, and we hope that its message spreads far and wide.”</p>

      <title>HP teamed up with System76 for the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> Linux from System76 is expanding with more vendors, as HP now have a teaser up for the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> laptop. Built for developers they say, although with the kind of specs on offer it seems like it might make quite a good gaming machine too.</p>
<p>Some of the specs include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8-Core AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO processor</li>
<li>16GB memory DDR4 @ 3200MHz</li>
<li>1TB fast PCIe NVMe M.2 storage²</li>
<li>14" diagonal FHD anti-glare display</li>
<li>AMD Radeon™ Graphics</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The unit itself looks absolutely gorgeous too, it even has a "Super" key instead of the standard Windows logo you get on most laptops as a great little added touch. Of course, it also comes with Pop!_OS as standard too, a project that has been "Months in the making" said System76 CEO Carl Richell.</p>

      <title>Looks like iFixit have Steam Deck parts available now (Update: it&#39;s gone)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: it turns out they put it up too early and they've now taken it down. As they said on <a href="https://twitter.com/iFixit/status/1527801532925857792" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Earlier today we published some pages related to our upcoming parts launch with Valve. These went live earlier than we planned, so we ended up taking them down. If you did get a parts order in, we'll honor it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the real launch soon!"</p>
<hr/>
<p>Have you already broken your shiny Steam Deck or want some spares to tinker with? You're in luck, as it seems parts have now appeared over on <a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/collections/game-console-parts?pf_t_manufacturer=Device+Manufacturer%3DValve&amp;pf_t_model=Model%3DSteam+Deck" target="_blank">iFixit</a>. Looks like in some places they're selling out fast and it's not available yet in all regions, but here in the UK it all seems to be in stock — but for how long?</p>
<p>From what I can see they currently have</p>
<ul>
<li>UK charger - £24.99</li>
<li>EU charger - £24.99</li>
<li>Screen Adhesive - £4.96</li>
<li>Battery Adhesive - £4.96</li>
<li>Motherboard (No SSD included) - £289.99</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3802797761653079645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3802797761653079645gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Front Plate - £24.99</li>
<li>Back Plate - £24.99</li>
<li>Right Bumper - £6.99</li>
<li>Left Bumper - £6.99</li>
<li>Speakers - £24.99</li>
<li>Steam Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99</li>
<li>D-pad Rubber Membrane - £4.99</li>
<li>Action Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99</li>
<li>Screen (64GB / 256GB) - From £59.99</li>
<li>512GB Anti-glare Screen - From £89.99</li>
<li>Fan - From £19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>So it seems right now they're missing the Battery, Thumbsticks, Face Buttons and probably other bits I forgot. So not the entire thing but plenty of it there ready and for those that might be sold out, at least you have an idea of a price for now.</p>

      <title>Project Zomboid version 41.71 out with Steam Deck and controller upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Zomboid, a survival game from The Indie Stone that's currently in Early Access just had a big new stable release, and it should now work better on the Steam Deck and with controllers overall.</p>
<p>Currently a Steam Deck Verified title, it actually wasn't supposed to be Verified until now as the testing was done on a Beta build, which is now what's live. Seems Valve need to tweak the auto-publishing of results when done on a non-Public build.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck they tweaked a bunch of their settings so that it should work properly out of the box, including at a resolution that actually works. You can also now do precise positioning when placing items when using a controller, more panels can be scrolled using the right-stick, the start button now brings up the main-menu in single-player, controller navigation added to the Steam Workshop UI, controller navigation for the server browser and lots of fixes for little niggling Steam Deck and controller issues. Overall, it runs <em>far</em> better in my test this morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925147351653047333gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This build also included some big new features too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new action music system.</li>
<li>New items and updated 3D models.</li>
<li>New forage items.</li>
<li>A compilation of new hair types.</li>
<li>Option to "add all" to partially full Thread, Duct Tape, Twine etc</li>
<li>Numerous multiplayer improvements.</li>
<li>Updated community translations.</li>
<li>Loads of balancing changes.</li>
<li>Plenty of bug fixes.</li>
<li>And much much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Full changelog can be found <a href="https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/54121-4171-released/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a quieter fan again, and louder volume in the latest updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another two big Steam Deck updates just dropped, one for the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220648637502115304" target="_blank">Stable</a> channel and one for the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/?ctp=4" target="_blank">Beta</a> channel. Here's what's new.</p>
<p><u><strong>Stable Update</strong></u></p>
<p>For everyone in the main Stable channel they adjusted the lock screen to include battery status, network status, and time. Plus you can also now toggle on the battery percentage in the header bar, found in Settings &gt; General.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6937232841653036970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6937232841653036970gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10366226571653036969gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10366226571653036969gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also button to reset the performance profile to system default, handy if you tweaked quite a few things:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15964825891653037152gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15964825891653037152gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Reduced login time for users with thousands of screenshots, the performance overlay is no longer stored with the per-app profile system and if you get Steam Support to remove the Steam Deck rewards put on a wrong account, you can also now reclaim them. Plus these bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed per-app performance profiles restoring the wrong FPS limit</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with keyboard theme not being applied the first time the keyboard was shown</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with keyboard theme not being applied when there is no connection to Steam</li>
<li>Fixed pinch-to-zoom gestures being active in certain places - preventing UI from being unexpectedly zoomed in</li>
<li>Fixed some focus issues in the Library when going back from a game's detail page. It should give focus back to the last focused item properly.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues with the Re-order Controller dialog</li>
<li>Fixed login issues with users that have a '/ 'character in their profile name</li>
<li>Fixed the Confirm button on controller layout export screen exporting more than one configuration</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 20th May, 2022: an extra update landed for the Stable channel:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="item-content">
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrectly displaying an update is available when there isn't one.</li>
<li>Fixed Official Steam controller layouts not loading in certain scenarios, such as the default Desktop layout for Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay level always being set to 0 on startup</li>
<li>Fixed manual GPU clock settings being deactivated after a suspend/resume cycle</li>
<li>Fixed controller layout error after editing a game-bundled layout</li>
<li>Fixed keyboard theme regression that prevented selecting the Default Theme</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Beta Update</strong></u></p>
<p>On the Steam Deck opt-in Beta, things are just as exciting.</p>
<p>The fan controller has been upgraded once again so it should be "now smarter, more stable, and quieter overall". So less of it randomly spinning up, and when it does it should be smoother. It's nice to see plenty of focus on this, as the model that has that louder fan really was annoying.</p>
<p>When you toggle on the performance HUD, it should also now give a more accurate reading of VRAM, plus they added more internal resolution options for games to choose from. Previously some games couldn't get the right resolutions, so now more will. Plus these bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed gain staging, resulting in higher max volume, and removes white noise coming through 3.5mm jack with some headphones.</li>
<li>Fixed PipeWire and Steam failing to elevate their thread priorities</li>
<li>Fixed the language dropdown in the Warframe launcher</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 21st May 21, 2022: another Beta update shipped with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>microSD card formatting process now performs a quick format</li>
<li>Reverted fan controller to previous version while the team works on more improvements and testing</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seems some Steam Deck units were getting a little toasty…</em></p>
<p>Quick note though: on one of my Steam Deck units, the Beta update caused a black screen with the fan blowing. If that happens to you try holding down the power button for 15 seconds, then tap it once and it should reboot properly and apply the update.</p>

      <title>Old World from the Civilization IV designer releases on Steam along with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is a new Native Linux historical strategy game from Soren Johnson, Lead Designer of Civilization IV and Offworld Trading Company and Mohawk Games.</p>
<p>This was originally an exclusive for Epic Games, and back when it released there in 2021 it gained some rather high praise from the wider bigger PC gaming websites. Since then though, the game has expanded dramatically with hundreds of new narrative events, a brand new DLC that also just released, lots of bug fixes, balance changes and various other improvements.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qw1d_7MvCBo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50833776a8d3a6ebf03c5ba7ed15c76a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qw1d_7MvCBo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: the publisher, Hooded Horse, was kind enough to pass along a review key for this.</em></p>
<p>Given the designer on this, it's safe to say this is like a spiritual successor to Civilization. It's much more than that though, and there's been a few attempts from others to do the same, but this is more like a slick evolution on it. Much more character-driven, so it's a little bit closer to Crusader Kings in that way too and honestly, I'm not sure I can see myself going back to any current Civilization title after playing Old World.</p>
<p>One of the major ways it mixes things up is the new Orders system. Instead of only moving units once per turn, you have an overall Orders currency to use each turn. Units still have limits and can get fatigued but this expands what's possible in such a strategy game making it just feel so much more open. It does mean you need to do a lot more planning too, and at times completely rethink what you're doing, as using up all your orders might leave you too open for an attack, as just one small example.</p>
<p><em>Did you screw up? Good news, you can undo moves repeatedly, and that alone makes me really love this.</em></p>
<p>An absolutely gorgeous looking game too. The artists did some truly fantastic work on all aspects of the design here. Even the fog of war clouds excited me when playing it for the first time, the way they gently caress the map, it's really something to look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14552979911652976709gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14552979911652976709gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The amount of info you're being given the first few times can feel a little daunting though. There's quite a bit of depth to various parts of the game, even just founding a city needs you to be careful because of the family system. When you go to found a city, you pick which family will be the founders and they each come with different bonuses so you're choosing your focus very early on. You also have to keep them all happy too, to ensure you keep various bonuses and don't lose out. Even though there's plenty going on, it's surprisingly accessible thanks to the clear UI.</p>
<p>Research is another area that's quite different here too with it being more random, and a bit more like Stellaris in fact. You are given a few cards to pick from, and those not picked go into a discard pile. Once your pile to draw from is empty, the discard pile comes back shuffled up for you to continue on. You still get access to a tech-tree but you don't get the direct planning to go through it like other games. (although you can target specific research to remind yourself when it comes up). This presents some difficult decisions when you're going through the game but does spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>One aspect of it that some will love and some will hate, is how much shorter it is compared to other similar games. It's a race to 200 turns, which for me is actually great. Games don't feel like they drag on forever! I continue to be quite amazed with Old World and it has firmly scratched the itch I wanted after burning out with Civilization.</p>
<p>With all the events though, of which the developer said there's at least 2,500 of them now, there's never a dull moment in any part of the game. So many choices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4148237761652976735gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4148237761652976735gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I quite liked how the tutorials were done too, as there's a fair bit to learn. You can go through <em>dedicated</em> tutorial missions that carefully guide you on the same map each time but you can also just play a normal game, with plenty of tutorial prompts and explanations as you go along. Best of both worlds and a nice touch.</p>
<p>When it comes to the fresh Native Linux port, I have to say that I'm very impressed. It works out of the box with no issues on Fedora 36, and performance is absolutely fantastic. It's even <em>playable</em> on Steam Deck. Turning down a few settings and upping the built-in scaling actually worked quite nicely but some text was still a bit too small. No obvious issues in my notes on it to tell you of, so it's a solid recommendation from me. A simply <em>must have</em> for strategy fans.</p>
<p>Later in June they plan to add in localizations for Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese, Spanish, Russian, French and German. If you buy it before May 25th, you get the Heroes of the Aegean DLC free.</p>
<p>Available for Linux on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597180/Old_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. For <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/old_world" target="_blank">GOG</a> it does not have the Linux build.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.25 Beta is out now for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for even more improvements to come to the KDE Plasma desktop? I know I am and <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.25 Beta</a> is now available.</p>
<p>This is readying up for a full release for everyone on June 14th, and they will also be holding a special "beta review day" of May 26th where anyone can join in for a day of "bug-hunting, triaging and solving alongside the Plasma devs".</p>
<p>Some of the improvements coming sound pretty great, a lot of it just fine-tuning the whole Plasma desktop to react better to certain situations and just give it a bit more spit and polish. I especially like some of the updates coming to the Discover software installer like an overhaul to the app page and showing permissions for Flatpak applications.</p>
<p>It's also good news for Wayland fans, as there appears to be quite a lot of bug fixes and overall improvements there too, over 200 in fact and that includes fixes and improvements for Xwayland too.</p>
<p>Also plenty of adjustments to the look and feel of Plasma with a nice rejection animation on lock screens / login for a wrong password, you can apply the accent colours of UI to match a wallpaper, tint the whole colour scheme with an accent colour, an optional floating panel for Plasma themes and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10477153721652974808gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10477153721652974808gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you want to try it live, it looks like KDE neon might be a good one with their regular unstable iso <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download" target="_blank">downloads</a>.</p>

      <title>Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent&#39;s Curse gets spruced up, works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse from Revolution Software just had a big update to improve how it handles on modern systems and screen resolutions. It also works great on the Steam Deck.   </p>
<p>For the Steam Deck specifically, the developer noted they added some detection directly for it to "natively adapt to the system once booted" that should "assure a seamless experience of enjoying Broken Sword 5 on the Steam Deck". So now you can go adventuring while taking the Deck on your travels.</p>
<p>Other improvements include using more modern compression for a smaller overall size of the game, better full-screen mode support with no more black screens when switching, support for more aspect ratios for less cropping and stretching issues.</p>

      <title>The modular Framework Laptop gets a new model with 12th Gen Intel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework are doing some great things after the first model of the modular Framework Laptop, then the mainboard release and new an upgraded model with 12th Gen Intel.</p>
<p>The new unit as a whole has some other parts upgraded too including a redesigned lid assembly for "significantly improved rigidity" and they say how they've also "carefully optimized standby battery life, especially for Linux users". A new expansion card is also coming soon for 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet.</p>
<p>Sticking to their promise of being modular and reducing waste, this 12th Gen Intel unit will also be available as an upgrade module to swap if you have a current Framework Laptop. The top cover is also available by itself for people who want the newer version and there's also an upgrade kit for them both.</p>
<p>The new units go up for pre-order today in US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, and Ireland with more countries being announced through this year. To order you need to place a deposit which is fully refundable and it's being done again in a batch system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3151033851652964347gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For their original model, the price has also been dropped to sell them all and fully move onto the new model. The 11th Gen Intel DIY model is down to £699 or £899 for the pre-built Windows model. While the new 12th Gen Intel DIY model is £819 and the pre-built £1,049.</p>
<p>Framework continue testing and working on their Linux support in the DIY edition too, noting that they've now tested Fedora 36 working "fantastically well out of the box, with full hardware functionality including WiFi and fingerprint reader support" and Ubuntu 22.04 "also works great after applying a couple of workarounds, and we’re working to eliminate that need".</p>
<p>More info on the Framework <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-and-upgraded-framework-laptop" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I truly hope to see more of this come along, it's super wasteful to get rid of an entire laptop for upgrades.</p>

      <title>Developer of popular noise suppression tool NoiseTorch has dev machine compromised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a user of NoiseTorch? It's a popular way of getting some pretty great noise suppression on your microphone, to keep out all that background noise or a hammer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/microphone-noise-suppression-app-noisetorch-has-a-new-release-with-early-pipewire-support/" target="_blank">hitting your desk</a>. Sadly, the developer had a machine compromised.</p>
<p>The developer announced on the <a href="https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> that a system that held some of their private keys was compromised, giving attackers the ability to mess with the code. For that reason, they're suggesting people to not trust the builds and they think the source code could be compromised too.</p>
<p>Such a shame for such a great app that I've used previously. However, it appears the community is <a href="https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch/issues/254" target="_blank">coming together</a> to review the code in an attempt to help save the project.</p>
<p>Alternatives exist for those of you still needing some right now like <a href="https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects" target="_blank">EasyEffects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/josh-richardson/cadmus" target="_blank">Cadmus</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will be able to salvage the project and ensure no harm was done.</p>

      <title>The Linux port of Psychonauts 2 will land next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having you been holding out for the Native Linux port of Psychonauts 2? Well, the developer has announced after a long wait that it's just about to finally land. This was funded as part of their original Fig campaign, with Double Fine Productions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/double-fine-say-psychonauts-2-for-linux-and-macos-still-coming/" target="_blank">previously stating</a> they took the port "quality seriously" which was a part of the reason for the delay on it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fig.co/campaigns/psychonauts-2/updates/1546" target="_blank">fresh update</a> they mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">I can finally (finally!) update everyone about the MacOS and Linux versions of <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. I’m dang glad to say that Mac and Linux versions will be available on all major storefronts next week.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you eager to play these versions, you do not need to ask for an extra game key. Everything will be provided on your Humble Games page.<strong> Please contact Humble for support - but please also remember these aren't live yet.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This has been a long journey and I know some players really wanted to play these versions sooner; time was taken to ensure they’re solid ports. The wait’s basically over! We’ll update next week as soon as they are available.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mBi9rqCZ4os"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54a71570fad68f61d431868605b8eb4b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mBi9rqCZ4os" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently it does work very well in Proton according to various reports but I'm sure plenty will be happy to see the official port landing.</p>
<p>It's available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/psychonauts_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/psychonauts-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Canonical seek Software Engineers for the &#39;Ubuntu Gaming Experience&#39; team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for helping to improve Ubuntu Linux and get it into shape for more gaming? Now is your chance, as Canonical are hiring exactly for that. They did say only recently that they were going "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/canonical-going-all-in-on-gaming-for-ubuntu-new-steam-snap-package-in-testing/" target="_blank">all in</a>" with gaming on Ubuntu, when they announced their testing Snap package for Steam and of course there was more to come.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://canonical.com/careers/3920832/software-engineer-ubuntu-gaming-experience-remote" target="_blank">new role</a> mentions they are "seeking Software Engineers to join the Ubuntu Gaming Experience team and be part of our mission to ship the best open source operating system in the world". What the heck is this team anyway? Well, as they explain, they're hiring to create a team that is focused on "performance, compatibility and user experience for gamers".</p>
<p>People in this role will "work with open source projects like Proton and partners like Unity to improve the gaming experience for Ubuntu users around the world, as well as the wider Linux gaming ecosystem in general" — so it's a wide ranging job and it appears Canonical want to get people involved directly in improving the likes of Wine and Proton, Mesa drivers graphics drivers and more as you need to be "effective working with low-level libraries, drivers, and the Linux graphics, sound and input stacks".</p>
<p>The good news is that it's a remote position, so pretty much anyone with the experience needed can apply to improve gaming on Linux and Ubuntu for everyone.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 3.5 RC 1 is up with a new asynchronous shader compilation system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine 3.5 is getting close to release with a first Release Candidate available for developers to test the next version of this open source game engine.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important FOSS projects around, giving developers a full game engine and editor to create games with that works great for both the editor and exports across many platforms.</p>
<p>Version 3.5 is coming in with some big new features including an asynchronous shader compilation + caching system, that uses a "ubershader" that gets compiled at startup to fill in for shaders initially and then the more efficient and material-specific shaders get compiled asynchronously, and cached for future runs. In short: this should enable games with Godot Engine to perform better overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16828382511652891763gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16828382511652891763gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other improvements include a backport of their much improved navigation system from the upcoming Godot 4.0, 3D physics interpolation to make everything look smooth at different framerates, an easy way to add basic occlusion culling, a port of the editor to Android, a lot of new features for Version Control Systems (VCS) integration in Godot, joypad events are now in a separate thread for Linux to prevent missed input and <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-3-5-rc-1" target="_blank">so much more</a>.</p>

      <title>Gamescope from Valve pulls in support for NVIDIA Image Scaling </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>, an open source project from Valve that's part of what powers the Steam Deck, now has support for NVIDIA Image Scaling. So it now supports both FSR 1.0 and NVIDIA Image Scaling for various GPUs.</p>
<p>The merge request was opened on the same day NVIDIA made that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">massive announcement</a> about having open source Linux GPU kernel modules and their new Beta Driver 515.43.04. That new driver version is also needed for NVIDIA users who want to try out Gamescope.</p>
<p>What is the point of Gamescope? Well, it handles the display of games in a way that keeps performance nice. If you're running it directly on top of a regular Linux desktop, it also prevents games from interfering with your desktop, plus it enables you to adjust all sorts of things like resolution, refresh rate and of course the extras like FSR 1.0 and now NVIDIA Image Scaling too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK provides a single spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm for cross-platform support. The scaling algorithm uses a 6-tap scaling filter combined with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters, which creates nice smooth images and sharp edges. In addition, the SDK provides a state-of-the-art adaptive directional sharpening algorithm for use in applications where no scaling is required.<br/>
The directional scaling and sharpening algorithm is named NVScaler while the adaptive-directional-sharpening-only algorithm is named NVSharpen. Both algorithms are provided as compute shaders and developers are free to integrate them in their applications.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile Sentinel rolls out, controller support works nicely on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the big Sentinel update to Path of Exile out now, I gave it a spin on my Steam Deck to get a feel for the controls and it really does work nicely.</p>
<p>As one of the biggest action-RPGs available on Steam, and it being free to play, it's wonderful to see it working so well out of the box thanks to Proton with no changes being needed to have it running. This update doesn't just affect the Steam Deck though of course, as controller support on desktop should work great too. You can view the full <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3264788" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Have a look at my video below briefly showing off how it works on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9viKt5l05PY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1405ccb1483b39ff8525d3cdcf8041b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9viKt5l05PY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Considering how smooth it is and how genuinely good it feels with the Steam Deck controls, it's highly likely I'll be personally spending a lot more time with this one. Since it has a built-in Vulkan rendering system, performance on Steam Deck and Linux desktops continues to be really good overall.</p>
<p>Path of Exile is available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" target="_blank">Steam Page</a>.</p>

      <title>This Steam Deck Durability Test had me watching in horror</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been various attempts to show how durable (or not so) the Steam Deck can be in various situations but JerryRigEverything definitely had me wincing. Obviously, a lot of durability tests are rather extreme but even so, it's interesting to see just how much the Steam Deck can take before you might need a replacement.</p>
<p>I went into this video expecting some of the standard stuff but I was honestly horrified at what was done, poor thing. It didn't even get a chance to make a gamer happy before it was tortured.</p>
<p>While this physical abuse to the Steam Deck might seem random, the tests are actually all pretty good to show up really what the Steam Deck is made of and why that carrying case is pretty essential for when you go anywhere. Seriously, I'm still putting mine in it to go downstairs.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="66xbBtnxb5k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afc6c7cd64b784be4f0dbf2f37cd2f2b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/66xbBtnxb5k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They are also giving away a Steam Deck, see how to get it on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacksJerryRig/status/1526314471961989120" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <title>Songs of Conquest looks good on Linux, works quite well on Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Conquest is a brand new release from Lavapotion and Coffee Stain Publishing, a turn-based tactical RPG with kingdom management that definitely feels like Heroes of Might and Magic. <u>Note</u>: key from Key Mailer.</p>
<p>I was never truly a big fan of Heroes of Might and Magic though, while I appreciate the lasting effect it had on a lot of people, I think many will appreciate another modern take on it. Featuring some great pixel-art touched up with modern effects and lighting, it really does look absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton it works on Linux desktops and the Steam Deck out of the box, it couldn't be simpler. Click install, hit play — nice. However, on the Steam Deck, some UI elements are just a bit too small, which I hope the developer can work on. It's only just entered Early Access so they have a lot to do. Additionally, you want Proton Experimental for best compatibility, although currently the cut-scenes are upside down.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TaMheQOX9yY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/197b3ba2e0f44dc1965ebaf67d906687.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TaMheQOX9yY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam Deck, the default Steam Input configuration it was given to act like a Keyboard and Mouse actually works really nicely for it. Since it's a slow game being turn-based, having that time to think helps. For now, playable and it does perform well to a solid 60FPS just keep in mind the smaller text and UI issue there. Even on the High settings (default), it performs at around 50-60FPS most of the time which is great, although tweaking it down to Medium makes it even better while still looking great on the Deck screen. With Medium settings and using the Steam Deck Beta to put it into 40Hz, looks like at least 3 hours battery life. Honestly with bigger text and UI it would be a fantastic experience on Deck, and then perfection with proper controller support.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux, no performance issues at all either, multiple-hundreds FPS. Everything looking great!</p>
<p>Seems like it has some nice writing through the campaign too. Although, honestly, I can't get over just how absolutely lush it looks. The maps have lots of little detail to them, as you explore and come across various camps and villages that allow you to buff up your forces or engage in battle and the battle animations look just as great too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18195061991652796424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18195061991652796424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I still have a lot more of it to play yet but it leaves a <em>lasting</em> first impression.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adventure Awaits - Explore a wide variety of maps with diverse enemies and valuable loot. Venture into contrasting biomes with unique enemy factions, environments and battlefields.</li>
<li>Build an Empire - Manage resources, research new advancements and expand your kingdom. Plan your towns to match your playstyle - will you utilise brute force, magic or a mix of both? There are many paths to world domination.</li>
<li>Wage War - Dive into a deep combat system utilizing troop abilities and powerful magic. Combine troops to maximize available spells and damage potential. Use the battlefield to your advantage by claiming high ground and protecting bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Alone or Together - Immerse yourself in epic single player adventure or challenge your friends to an honourable duel, online or local!</li>
<li>In-game Level Editor - The in-game level editor allows you to create your own adventures using the same tools the developers use to create campaign and skirmish maps. Script in-game events, control the soundtrack, write dialogue and share your creations with others!</li>
<li>Four Factions - Four factions are locked in an epic conflict. Arleon, knights of old battling each other for dominance. Rana, ancient tribes fighting for survival in the swamp. Loth, necromancers raising the dead to create a glorious future. Barya, bold mercenaries and inventors dedicated to coin, gunpowder and independence.</li>
<li>A Choral Campaign - Listen to the bards as they celebrate your path to victory. Each of the two campaigns comes with a unique song that tells the tale of your rise and ruin. Unlock new verses as you complete missions, enjoying the full track at the end of the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer is estimating around one year to remain in Early Access. For now what they have is an absolutely magical start to what could turn into one of the best fantasy strategy / RPG mixes around. It's already hit a Very Positive user rating on Steam too, which is unsurprising to me.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see another really interesting release working on Day 1 with Proton.</em></p>

      <title>Looks like the Budgie desktop is coming to Fedora Linux officially</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love the <a href="https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop" target="_blank">Budgie</a> desktop environment? Good news, another Linux distribution looks like it will have it soon with Fedora. This is official too, with developer Joshua Strobl formally getting it going.</p>
<p>This will include all the major parts required like the Budgie Control Center, Budgie Desktop, Budgie Desktop View and Budgie Screensaver. Going even further, Strobl noted in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/uq3gah/budgie_desktop_has_now_been_submitted_for/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post they are "strongly considering" getting a proper Fedora Budgie Spin going, which is Fedora's way of providing install media with various different desktop environments compared to the main Fedora Workstation with GNOME.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311430961652791083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311430961652791083gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see things going well for Budgie after the split from Solus, as it's a pretty slick desktop environment that looks modern while staying out of your way to get work and gaming sorted on Linux.</p>

      <title>Fall Guys to become Epic Exclusive for new owners, so no Steam Deck support then</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again. Another game is moving from Steam to become an Epic Exclusive and this time it's <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/fall-guys-is-going-free-on-june-21-launching-on-playstation-nintendo-switch-xbox-and-the-epic-games-store" target="_blank">Fall Guys</a>.</p>
<p>It's the same situation as Rocket League. Epic acquired the studio, eventually made it free to play and pulled all new players from Steam to force them onto the Epic Store and that's what's happening with Fall Guys on June 21st. So anyone who owns it on Steam can continue playing and get updates but no new players on Steam will be able to get it.</p>
<p>For Proton and Steam Deck, this complicates things. Right now, Fall Guys has the Easy Anti-Cheat file needed to run on Linux and Steam Deck, although it's in the wrong place and needs moving to work (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/ge-proton-715-is-out-enables-fall-guys-on-linux-and-steam-deck-easily/" target="_blank">see here</a>). Now, there's really no reason for them to keep it there and certainly the Epic Store release won't think about Linux and Steam Deck at all since Epic don't support either.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cnAxsZXd7vE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c1596702612843b3c4f77f59e1b36e24.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cnAxsZXd7vE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What to do then? Well, there's always the cheap knock-off of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677740/Stumble_Guys/" target="_blank">Stumble Guys</a> which appears to work perfectly although it's clearly a much cheaper copy that really doesn't feel as good. You never know what might happen though, perhaps they might see a surge in players and just keep on making it better.</p>

      <title>Super Hexagon is getting a big overhaul available in Beta now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Hexagon Neo is the upcoming big upgrade for Super Hexagon from Terry Cavanagh, originally released in 2012 it's remained a rather popular title. Currently with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over sixteen thousand users, it's probably worth a look if you've still never played it.</p>
<p>With simple looks and devilish difficulty, Super Hexagon has a simple idea: you control a tiny little triangle, and various hexagons come at you quickly from the screen edges and you need to avoid getting trapped. That's pretty much it but it really is good.</p>
<p>Super Hexagon Neo will bring with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The framework got completely replaced with a new one built just for Super Hexagon</li>
<li>It should be more stable and in some cases quite a bit faster</li>
<li>The window is now resizable, and macOS/Wayland now have high-DPI support</li>
<li>Controller support is better and the UI now accounts for controller input</li>
<li>A "part 2" eventually</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the technical side of things it's now using SDL, FNA3D and FAudio. Together it means better window management (like a resizable window finally), better controller support and many other smaller tech improvements behind the scenes to just keep it running nicely across various platforms. More on all that <a href="https://superhexagon.com/neo/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Part 2 will be a major update but it sounds like it is still some time away.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2sz0mI_6tLQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30de3c4abd133e1340de0cc451f45ae5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2sz0mI_6tLQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To test it right now you can opt into the Beta on <u>Steam</u> named "neo-update". Right click on the game in your Steam Library, go to Betas and just pick that from the dropdown. It will come to other stores when ready.</p>
<p>You can buy it in many places like <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/super-hexagon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/super-hexagon" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/super_hexagon" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to take better quality screenshots on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get some higher quality screenshots of all the awesome moments in gaming on the Steam Deck (or any Linux desktop?). Here's a quick-tip guide on what to do. This will also work on Windows too but of course the Steam Deck uses Linux, and so the path to certain folders is different.</p>
<p>Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be in Desktop Mode (Power button -&gt; Switch to Desktop).</li>
<li>Open the Steam Settings (right click Steam icon -&gt; Settings).</li>
<li>Click in-game on the left panel.</li>
<li>Click save an uncompressed copy.</li>
<li>Click the "Screenshot Folder" button and pick where you want them to drop in.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't want that but do wish to know where to find all your screenshots regardless, you can find them in the hidden Steam folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>In your Dolphin file manager, head to the hamburger menu in the top right.</li>
<li>Click the Show hidden files option.</li>
<li>Then head through: <code class="inline-code">.steam/steam/userdata/yourid/760/remote/gameid/screenshots/</code> or if you don't have .steam for whatever reason it's also found in <code class="inline-code">.local/share/Steam/userdata/yourid/760/remote/gameid/screenshots/</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Short video guide on it if that helps too:</p>

      <title>Bad at Chess? Bring a shotgun in this roguelike spin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If, like me, you're terrible at Chess, how about the chance to jump across the board with a Shotgun? That's exactly what you do in Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Working out of the box with no issues found with Steam Play Proton, it's another small game that will end up sucking away vast amounts of your time and it's pretty cheap too at only £4.99. It doesn't have controller support but on Steam Deck, it has such simple controls it's practically perfect anyway with the trackpad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10499837411652696014gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10499837411652696014gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea is that you were a rubbish King, treated your people badly and so they all left you (including your Queen) for the other one. Obviously you're mad about it and all you had left was your trusty Shotgun, so you decide to go on something of a Chess-rampage and battle your way through.</p>
<p>Runs don't last particularly long, so it makes for a fantastic coffee-break game but it's so delightful that you can easily lose a few hours to it too. So it's a bit like Vampire Survivors and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a> in that way. What makes it especially good is that it has some of the basic rules of Chess for movements but adds the uniqueness found in rougelikes and the action too. Each turn you get to decide where you go, or who you shoot as you attempt to avoid a checkmate while also hunting down the enemy King.</p>
<p>After each floor you will also get to pick between two random cards, each giving an upgrade for you and the enemy to spice things up which is why it's fun to replay through it many times.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U_O1_a6CLog"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/967c3bbd8bf6e416489e11e5743c343b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U_O1_a6CLog" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is going right near the top of the pile for my regular games on both my Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Doom &amp; Destiny Worlds gets Steam Deck Verified, dev gives info on what they changed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doom &amp; Destiny Worlds is an open world turn-based RPG with crafting, building, farming, and 4 players local co-op option. Recently it was Verified for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For those who do want the techy-info, I asked the developer what was changed to get it working nicely and Verified for the Steam Deck. They replied to say: "The main changes required was in full controller support without a keyboard and OpenGL code compatibility. In specifics where on PC we could go without explicitly clearing renderbuffers as they where usually automatically cleared before reuse, on Deck we had to explicitly clear RB on every reuse. There are also some Win32 libraries we use to better detect keyboards that were crashing on the Deck."</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> 2.3.1 is officially out now, bringing with it some big new features to help you manage games from Epic Games and GOG.

<p>Plus:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can install the Windows version of a game from GOG instead of the Native Linux version if you wish.</li>
<li>The Heroic app can now auto-update, for Linux it's with the AppImage.</li>
<li>You can add favourite games.</li>
<li>You can hide games.</li>
<li>Swap between favourites or recently played (or nothing) at the top of the app.</li>
<li>A new accessibility screen to allow you to tweak certain settings:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13315749381652693323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13315749381652693323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now sort the game list alphabetically or by install status.</li>
<li>Heroic will now show you how much space is left on the device you're downloading / installing on.</li>
<li>Various other UI improvements.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really fantastic to see just how quickly Heroic is evolving to become a real quality way to manage your games, especially for Epic who don't support Linux at all with games or their store.</p>
<p>This is probably my favourite launcher because it's so simple and just gets the job done on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Deck Builders Round Up</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:left">Deckbuilders! I love 'em. Slay the Spire got me into this genre digitally, after originally feeling the pull of Magic the Gathering in the late 90's. After over a hundred hours playing Slay the Spire, the classic that invigorated the whole genre, I had the bug, bad. So since late 2019 I’ve been hunting for more. MOAR! Here’s a round up of a few favourites.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a couple of Proton-only titles, then look at the native options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Neoverse</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/994220/NEOVERSE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em>(Note: Proton)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Yes, this <em>is</em> full of scantily-clad, over-sexualised ladies, thanks for noticing. Judge me all you like, but after landing this in a Humble Bundle, I was gobsmacked at how good it is and I stand by that assessment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7215398741652371832gol573.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This is the game in this round up most like Slay the Spire, and like its inspiration (it launched almost exactly one year later), each of the three characters have very different styles. The right amount of challenge combines with surprisingly deep gameplay and brilliant synergies if you land the right cards. Well worth playing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Tainted Grail: Conquest</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1199030/Tainted_Grail_Conquest/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tainted_grail" target="_blank">GOG</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">(<em>Note: Proton. Also, I didn’t test the GOG version under Lutris/Wine, apologies</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Another single-player vs the world game, but this time, with a beautifully realised 3D world which acts as the map. The map has a clever lighting mechanic which revolves around a dwindling torch, driving the gameplay forward. Some unusual design choices in this one – for example just a single “block” will block ALL damage from one source, while other stats drive armour and dodge. There’s a lot going on and it’s pretty challening, but beautfully done. I've not played much yet, but it looks like there's about 7 characters to unlock.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Across the Obelis</strong><strong>k</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385380/Across_the_Obelisk/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Still in early access, but showing a lot of promise, this is the first "team" game I'm covering - this features a cast of four characters from different classes. The mechanics are under heavy development, but there's a nice combination of in-game progress as you build your deck and between-run progress as you build up city resources. There’s also the glimmering of a cool story developing already, and the lore of a fantasy world recovering after decades of conflict. Already fully playable for multiple hours, this is also one to keep an eye on if you prefer the finished product, as I suspect it’s going to be pretty special.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Roguebook</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076200/Roguebook/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">My personal favourite, this game revolves around a party of two taking on a series of challenges inspired by the developer's other game, Faeria. Amazing (truly AMAZING) synergies are at play here, allowing you to develop awesome teamwork with much less RNG than Slay the Spire.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20019789751652371829gol573.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I honestly can’t recommend it enough. Full of character, an incredible overland map mechanic, inventive challenge system, beautiful graphics, clear, clean gameplay – it’s a must-buy in my opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Hadean Tactics</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260590/Hadean_Tactics/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I’ve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/hadean-tactics-a-realtime-auto-battler-with-deck-building-launches-today/" target="_blank">covered this one before</a> and it continues to develop apace, as you can see when Liam covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/the-great-auto-battler-deck-builder-hadean-tactics-gets-a-big-content-update/" target="_blank">6 months later</a> for its huge content update. It’s the combination of classic deck building with grid-based auto-battling which makes this so unique and compelling.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4262499721652371892gol573.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The auto-battling is frantic, but freezes every 7 seconds to allow you to spend your three energy by playing cards from your draw pile. Your tactics here can deal damage, boost allies or reposition units, which all follow their own rules about how they attack on the field of battle. Intense and unusual.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Honourable mentions</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Steamworld: Hand of Gilgamech</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/804010/SteamWorld_Quest_Hand_of_Gilgamech/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/steamworld_quest_hand_of_gilgamech" target="_blank">GOG</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Much more story-based than the others I've mentioned, but still recommended. Some synergies, much more limited deck-building, but because it's driven by its narrative, there's much more of a slow-burn going on here.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Dicey Dungeons</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dicey_dungeons" target="_blank">GOG</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">This one hopefully needs no introduction. Is it really a deck builder? I don’t really care about pigeon-holing it – it’s great, and deserves to be played!</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Deep Sky Derelicts [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698640/Deep_Sky_Derelicts/" target="_blank">Steam</a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deep_sky_derelicts" target="_blank">GOG</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left">A brilliant sci-fi team-based deck-builder. I recommend sticking to it for a while, because it starts out very slowly. It pays off in the longer run though.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left">If you have any other deck-building suggestions, holler in the comments!</p>

      <title>Lovecraft&#39;s Untold Stories 2 gets delayed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Although the release date for Lovecraft's Untold Stories 2 was only announced (along with Native Linux support) recently, it seems they're going to give it a bit more time to cook.</p>
<p>It was going to release on May 17, 2022 but they've emailed in to say the game as a whole just needs more time after all the feedback they had during testing. No new date yet but they said they will announce it sometime soon. As a reminder: while it is a sequel, you <em>don't</em> need to have played the first game, as they've made sure new players will have everything they need and players "will understand the story".</p>
<p>Some fresh screenshots were also shared with the announcement like these:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11835673681652474982gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11835673681652474982gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6041800121652474983gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6041800121652474983gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 continues the narrative of the cult classic first game, but this time players will continue the fight against the unknown with new elements like crafting - using blueprints and resources to create consumables and even new equipment. Reunite with old acquaintances and meet new heroes with up to 6 playable characters to choose from, explore new procedurally generated locations, defend yourself against dozens of different enemies and face off against epic bosses. But beware… Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 is more challenging than ever before, and the tough nightmarish creatures opposing you will not give up easily!"</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight dozens of different enemies, monsters and terrifying bosses from the Cthulhu Mythos</strong> in this intense, challenging action RPG. Ferocious beasts in the Swamps, Asylum lunatics, City thugs and the demonic creatures from the void will test your resolve to uncover the truth!</li>
<li><strong>Meet the 6 playable characters</strong> <strong>-</strong> 3 familiar faces from the series and 3 complete newcomers - each with their own weapons, gear and skills. Switch between them freely and pick the one most suited for the task at hand!</li>
<li><strong>Collect hundreds of different weapons and clothing items, or craft your own -</strong> scour every last room in a level, open every single box and get rewarded with randomized drops of gear, money for trading or resources and blueprints for crafting.</li>
<li><strong>Side quests are crucial -</strong> you can earn extra resources and items and get that extra bit of advantage you may need to be able to progress in the main story. Don’t forget to trigger side quests every time you encounter them, you don’t have to finish them right away, but keep them for when you need extra loot!</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the roguelike elements -</strong> level maps are randomly generated, as are all loot drops. The game is not pure roguelike: if you die or choose to restart the level, you only lose progress in the current area. Use this to your advantage, and if you don’t get the loot you wanted; try again!</li>
<li><strong>Make use of Charms and Amulets!</strong> Sacred relics which grant strange new abilities. Find those that serve you the best and make your journey unique - but beware, power may come at a cost!</li>
<li><strong>Plunge into the world of darkness where every step could be your last</strong>. Balance on the brink of madness as you explore the Asylum and various other locales in the city of Arkham, Swamps, Enchanted Forest, even the Underworld and many more mind-bending locations, all in procedurally generated levels!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Open 3D Engine v22.05 out, O3DCon in October with proposals open</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally Amazon Lumberyard that was donated to open source, the Open 3D Foundation just announced a big new release and they have an annual conference coming up.</p>
<p>Lots new in O3DE v22.05 including upgrades for core stability, installer validation, motion matching updates, user-defined property (UDP) support for the asset pipeline, and automated testing advancements.</p>
<p>Work to improve the game engine for artists came along with this release thanks to the ability to integrate user-defined properties (UDP) metadata into its asset pipeline from source assets so that scene-building and asset-processing logic can be customized using this metadata. Animation saw improvements too so animators can "utilize motion matching, a data-driven animation technique that synthesizes motions based on existing animation data and current character and input contexts to deliver photorealistic experiences".</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simpler customization of the render pipeline is now possible using a new set of APIs. Examples of gems that currently exploit this capability include Terrain, LyShine and TressFx.</li>
<li>Developers can now re-use Material Types much more easily.</li>
<li>Developers can now control the spawning of player-controlled, networked entities using an improved interface, a capability that is essential for building multiplayer games.</li>
<li>Automated tests now verify that an installer build is valid, and ensures that all of the steps within the build are successfully executed. These tests are run nightly for O3DE, and have been designed so that anyone can plug them into their quality verification process.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Linux specifically the whitebox module is also <a href="https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/5075" target="_blank">now</a> supported. Full release notes <a href="https://www.o3de.org/docs/release-notes/archive/22-05-0/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>With biannual releases planned and the next due in October 2022, plenty more will be on the way. Do you have high hopes for this game engine? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>As for the conference it's happening on October 18-19, 2022, in Austin, Texas and they're looking for people to do various talks and so proposals are <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/o3dcon/program/cfp/" target="_blank">now open</a>. This will be a hybrid event, so anyone interested in their quickly advancing open source game engine can attend in-person or virtually.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"I'm proud of the O3DE community's focus on core stability while delivering new capabilities aimed to simplify and enhance 3D development for developers around the globe," said Royal O'Brien, Executive Director of O3DF and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. "I'm also incredibly excited about the opportunity O3DCon offers in bringing together diverse minds to collaborate on advancing the state of open 3D development across so many industries."</p>

      <title>Please Fix The Road will have an official version just for pirates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Please Fix The Road is an upcoming puzzle game I highlighted back in March because it looks simply beautiful and perhaps a bit of a challenge. The developer announced recently a rather unusual plan in the indie dev space, involving pirates.</p>
<p>A wonderfully styled puzzle game where you, as the name suggests, fix up roads by rotating and moving tiles. The end result doesn't need to look good, you just need to get people from A to B by manipulating multiple tiles at a time, insert new tiles, destroy them and more.</p>
<p>For this upcoming release and word of pirates being spotted, we're not talking about those who actually sail the seas and get up to no good, we're talking about software pirates here — obviously. Instead of going after them, or getting bothered by them, the developer has decided to make an "official" pirate version. While not a unique idea as a few other developers have done it in the past, it's not exactly something that's popular with developers with all sorts of arguments for and against doing it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wS0QSZs1H8A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d6a9b7c4ee609d23c1df7cb50333a86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wS0QSZs1H8A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developer Ariel Jurkowski said on <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielJurkowski/status/1522202001702068225" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Pirate version will have all of the launch levels, but no updates. No strings attached. There's an extra pirate themed song at the start, altered intro sequence, a pirate face instead of the cogwheel options icon and a request in the options menu to buy the game. Cheers!"</p>
<p>Following up in another <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielJurkowski/status/1522220431402586112" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post in reply to a user, Jurkowski also said: "It would be pirated anyway and I don't blame anyone for it, it is what it is. I hope at least some people will appreciate the gesture, maybe I'll get some PR points from this. Cheers!"</p>

      <title>art of rally is getting another big free update with Indonesia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for one more run? Funselektor Labs have announced that art of rally is set for another big free expansion. This time you get to race through Indonesia with the developer promising "plenty of palms, even more beaches".</p>
<p>No actual release date is being given out yet other than "later this year". All we know is that it's going to include 6 whole new tracks to blast through and there will be a new free-roaming area to test out too. Apart from that, it's likely we might see some bug fixes and other polishing work.</p>
<p>Only a teaser was given out for now, which you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T7fEPFQV_Q4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e481fda42854a515f880ca5bc52856d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T7fEPFQV_Q4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See some thoughts in my original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/art-of-rally-strips-down-the-furious-sport-into-a-serene-top-down-experience/" target="_blank">art of rally release article</a>. in short: it's wonderful and well worth picking up if you love a good challenge. Since release it's seen multiple big free expansions and lots of overall improvements so it has only gotten better since.</p>
<p>You can buy art of rally for Linux from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/art_of_rally?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/art-of-rally?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental bumps minimum driver version, more playable on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest update to Proton Experimental has landed for running Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck. Here's all that's changed. Firstly, the driver version requirements have seen a bump.

<ul>
<li>Gary Grigsby's War in the East</li>

      <title>Steam Deck gets some quick fixes, main Steam Client update with Deck Verified Collections</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a small update for the Steam Deck, along with an update to the main desktop Steam client.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck it's mainly a small clean-up release after the recent big update. Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216144458731474306" target="_blank">what's new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed per-app performance profiles for non-Steam shortcuts</li>
<li>Fixed TDP limit slider temporarily displaying an incorrect value</li>
<li>Fixed demos and free games failing to install from the Steam Store</li>
<li>Fixed keys with AltGr functionality not being capitalized properly</li>
<li>Added rumble / haptics toggles back to the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Updated localization</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the main desktop Steam client <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/5525365201760610310" target="_blank">update</a>, there's a new set of Steam Deck compatibility options for Dynamic Collections. So now you can set up your own dedicated collections in the Steam client as a whole for Deck Verified and Playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2624496741652433202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2624496741652433202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently you <em>cannot</em> set it to <em>just</em> Playable titles. It's either: Verified; Verified + Playable; Verified + Playable + Untested; Verified + Playable + Untested + Unsupported.</p>
<p>On top of that performance should be improved for opening app details of games that have lots of DLC, multiple bug fixes for Steam Cloud so there should be fewer problems with cloud syncing, on-screen keyboard should work better when streaming to a Steam Deck and other miscellaneous fixes including these specific for Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where updating graphics drivers would re-download media pre-caching files</li>
<li>Fixed the file picker extension filters not appearing when selecting Library custom art</li>
<li>Fixed adding non-Steam shortcuts with spaces in the path</li>
<li>Added home and mounted drive paths to the file picker quick bar</li>
<li>Added the ability for the file picker to remember the previous location when selecting Library custom art</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stellaris 3.4 &#39;Cepheus&#39; and Stellaris: Overlord out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive has released the major Stellaris: Overlord expansion, along with a free Stellaris 3.4 version update. Let's go over what's new.</p>
<p>This big new expansion adds in brand new vassalization mechanics, some more varied empire additions spreadout across the stars, five new origins, new technology, orbital rings, hyper relays and quantum catapults to travel quickly and of course some stellar new music as well to relax while you're subjugating other empires and bending them to your will.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ONAnoNoax5U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/da7657711c27f6fac0c332ab8582fb72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ONAnoNoax5U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the new origins added in, Overlord gives you a few ways to spice up your early game including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imperial Fiefdom - You may be just a Specialist Empire now, but some day, the galaxy may need a new ruler… shouldn’t it be you?</li>
<li>Slingshot to the Stars - The ruined remains of a Quantum Catapult have been discovered near your homeworld - what secrets might it unlock if your people are clever enough to bring it back online?</li>
<li>Subterranean - Your species adapted to life underground, excelling in mining and archaeology. See what awaits you far, far above the surface!</li>
<li>Teachers of the Shroud - Developing in contact with the curious psions known as the Shroudwalkers, your empire has learned a thing or two about expanding their minds!</li>
<li>Progenitor Hive - Under your leadership, this hivemind empire can achieve more than ever before… but without your guidance, the hive will fall to ruin!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't had time to try them all, since games of Stellaris can take a very long time to go through. For my chosen play-through of the DLC though, I went for "Slingshot to the Stars" and I can safely say that's possibly the most exciting start to Stellaris I've ever had. You start off with one of the new Quantum Catapults very close to you, so it's an easy one to check out something big that's brand new in Overlord.</p>
<p>The first time I laid eyes on that Quantum Catapult, my space-nerd heart nearly exploded with excitement to begin unravelling its mysteries. Who made it? Why did they leave it? What does it actually do? Many questions and it takes some time to answer them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8588396341652379522gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8588396341652379522gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You find out more about it using the relic research system, assigning a ship and a scientist to it as you dive further into its secrets and it's things like this that make me fully appreciate some of the writing that goes into the little stories spread throughout Stellaris — something this was designed around. Honestly, I wish the Quantum Catapult research actually lasted longer, as I was enjoying the little logs that were coming in on it immensely. The ending of that chain was bittersweet but you do find out why it was created and now it is yours. Time to reach for the stars, once repaired that is, which isn't as costly as expected for such a big thing.</p>
<p>Once repaired or constructed (everyone can make them eventually), it's not a done deal. They carry a certain risk. While you may be able to use them to throw a fleet across the stars — they might not end up exactly where you intended and that risk increases the further out you try for. Thankfully, they do have upgrades to make them better but they're costly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4108498541652379628gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4108498541652379628gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The fact that I can just attempt to YOLO a fleet of ships across space, perhaps into enemy territory is awesome, it really does open up so many more ways to play. Not just for those using it but you also have to think about protection against it, and perhaps attempt to take it down or take it over as a priority.</p>
<p>For the free new features in Stellaris 3.4 Cepheus, one of the most interesting is the new situation system. This covers multiple things like Resource Deficits, Planetary Uprisings and Machine Uprisings and some other new story events that have been added in. They're far less basic, and have you run through stages, so it's a little more like the artifacts system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13520563871652382902gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13520563871652382902gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm quite a big fan of this system, especially when it comes to the resource issues that I constantly come up against because I'm quite terrible at managing everything. Instead of being brutally punished, with one deficit leading to another, having it start off slower and gradually progress onto being worse is much more manageable. Really, it just seems like a more fair way of handling it, giving players less resource-savvy to have more of a chance to come back from the brink.</p>
<p>Being modding friendly, I can't wait to see what new and exciting ways modders can enhance the game even further with this situation system. Let me know in the comments if you can think of anything fun for it. Loads more included, see the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/dev-team-3-4-2-cepheus-patch-released-checksum-7836.1524452/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty safe to say that if you haven't touched Stellaris for a while, or even since the early months after the original release, coming back to it now is like a very different game. Even without a single DLC pack, Stellaris is so full of content it's quite fantastic and it continues being one of my absolute favourite strategy games. It's also still easily the most accessible strategy game to come from Paradox.</p>
<p>You really can't go wrong with Stellaris paired up with the Overlord expansion. However, the Overlord is perhaps far less essential than other big expansions but that doesn't mean it isn't good, it's still a very fun time and more of Stellaris is always a good thing in my book.</p>
<p><em>A fab time to jump in with a big sale on now too.</em></p>

      <title>Save the Bees on May 20 with the release of APICO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the most important creatures on Earth and now you'll be looking after them in APICO on May 20, 2022. Developed by the brotherly duo that is TNgineers, along with publishing from Whitethorn Games, this is the next big cozy indie game you need to keep on your radar.</p>
<p>A peaceful game where you explore, build and take care of nature's precious pollinators. Collect them, breed them and more in a game that combines together elements of resource gathering, biology, and beekeeping minigames, taking ideas from a mix of real-life and fantasy apiculture and floriculture. As you expand, you will be able to find lost species, cross-breed and repopulate various islands. Sounds like a perfect game to cozy up with on a Steam Deck to me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UJJQwV51SGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8057eec953bf15f3c2c226500093a501.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UJJQwV51SGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique crafting &amp; beekeeping minigames that drive gameplay progression</li>
<li>Cross-breed different bees to discover over 30 new species</li>
<li>Make and sell honey, Apicola, and other beekeeping products</li>
<li>Repopulate lost species and release them back into the wild</li>
<li>Multiple biomes to explore, each with their own unique bee species</li>
<li>Uncover the forgotten secrets of the APICO islands</li>
<li>Play together with friends in 4 player online co-op!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only does it seem like a wonderful game that I very much enjoyed the demo with, it will also help support the Bees! The developers will be donating a portion of sales towards national and international bee, beekeeping, &amp; wild bee conservation charities. Gotta save the Bees!</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://tngineers.itch.io/apico" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Uh oh, Gunlocked is like Vampire Survivors in space and just as absorbing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you burned out on Vampire Survivors and want something new? Or perhaps you just prefer spaceships? Gunlocked is here to give you more action.</p>
<p>On Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with the latest Proton 7. On Steam Deck, setting it to fullscreen instead of windowed gives you a better screen size as this game gives a special border in windowed mode.</p>
<p>In Gunlocked, just like Vampire Survivors, you have no direct weapon control. Instead, weapons fire off automatically on timers, so the strategy is a mix of rapid dodging and knowing where to be when your weapons are about to fire. To put it another way, Gunlocked is a vertical-scrolling twin-stick without the second stick. You get a small area to move around in like classic shooters, but it has the added upgrade and unlock system that Vampire Survivors is now known for too with you collecting little gems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19500783271652359923gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19500783271652359923gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once you collect enough of these gems, you level up and get to pick between a few new abilities or power-ups to build up your ship as you go. You can unlock some incredibly fun combination moves with this system. Weapons aren't the usual lasers firing in front of you either, there's a big mix of things requiring some thought in how you play. Frankly it's almost intoxicating, I don't want to put it down, I need more.</p>
<p>A run doesn't last particularly long either, so it's a great game to take a break with and doesn't require you to stick at it for hours.</p>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Action-roguelite gameplay</li>
<li>Rich, 2d pixel art graphics</li>
<li>20 Powerful upgrades</li>
<li>3 Unique playable pilot characters</li>
<li>11 unique enemies w/ multiple variations</li>
<li>5 powerups to collect</li>
<li>An evolving boss that gets more powerful as you do</li>
<li>10+ Steam Achievements</li>
<li>Gamepad support</li>
<li>Every playthrough is unique</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's in Early Access, plenty more is to come including new enemies, bosses, pilots with unique attributes, powerups, weapons and upgrades, difficulty options, and more!</p>
<p>Here's a short look at some gameplay because I simply had to video this one directly, absolutely love it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LBuIaIV-k9g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26a2d78d7979123d944866fe3f5d3d9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LBuIaIV-k9g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New favourite? Quite possibly. Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1512480/Gunlocked/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It's also only £2.89.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper gets dedicated servers, upcoming Sunken Sea Biome sounds huge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper is another big indie hit and for good reason, it's a total gem and it's expanding to become a lot bigger.</p>
<p>First, a new update is out that brings with it dedicated servers, boosting the online functionality of the game. So now you can share worlds with friends, and set up a dedicated server for a community without someone needing to be online at all times to host it and play. However, the normal in-game hosting is still available as before — best of both worlds, along with new admin functions to keep things nice and clean.</p>
<p>Some other new additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A reinforcement mechanic has been added that allows players to extend the durability of their items as well as giving the item a small stat boost. Reinforcing an item costs some of the item's crafting materials.</li>
<li>Added scrap parts that can drop from destructibles and some enemies.</li>
<li>Higher tier hoes now cover a larger area. This works for both tilling and gathering plants in larger areas.</li>
<li>Added a digging damage stat to shovels that impacts how many uses it takes to dig up ground. Health of ground has been rebalanced around the digging damage of shovels so that higher tier shovels are more effective against lower tier ground and lower tier shovels are less effective against higher tier ground.</li>
<li>Added a Scarlet Hoe that can be crafted in the Scarlet Workbench.</li>
<li>Added a Scarlet Shovel that can be crafted in the Scarlet Workbench.</li>
<li>Moved the Scarlet Sword to be crafted in the Scarlet Anvil instead of the Scarlet Workbench.</li>
<li>Large Watering Can now covers 2x2 tiles. More watering options coming later!</li>
<li>Fishing rods no longer have durability.</li>
<li>The chance to gain kelp from fishing has been reduced, and we’ve added resources such as ores, wood, fibre and scrap parts that can be gained from fishing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BIYcsYVxzPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ea0bcd27bddb6575af1ec256495fd2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BIYcsYVxzPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A roadmap has also now been posted, with the first major update due in June. THis is a big one too adding in a new sub-biome, a new boss, 4 new enemies, a new types of ore, more gear and weapons, a legendary weapon, new fish, new plants, teleporters, boats, map markers and much more.</p>
<p>I honestly can hardly contain my excitement for that update, after stopping really early to give it more time to get updates before playing properly but I absolutely loved what I saw from it.</p>
<p>The developers also recently announced they hit over 500,000 downloads within the first two weeks after launch, which is an incredible milestone for an Early Access game.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Get an early look at The Garden Path with a few copies left on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Garden Path is an upcoming casual chilled-out life sim that looks gorgeous. Now you can get access to it with the early bird limited access system on itch.io.</p>
<p>A game designed to be played whenever you feel like it, and things continue advancing in the world while you're not playing, so it's not requiring you to be sat playing endless hours to progress anywhere. For those of us with busy lives that still want to check out more games, it sounds interesting.</p>
<p>"The Garden Path explores the quiet moments of a life well lived, where your garden will grow to reflect both the passing of time and your own design. Time here runs in concert with the real world, and the passing of seasons heralds new encounters and a new story to weave.</p>
<p>Above all, The Garden Path is a life sim that celebrates the tranquil and the pensive, a tucked-away place to shape and grow as you like."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A humble gardening life-sim with real-time progress even when you’re away. Play for a little while, and come back some time later to see how the Garden evolves.</li>
<li>Rich illustrated visuals and original soundtracks that draw you in.</li>
<li>A charming cast of characters, all with their own stories to tell.</li>
<li>A far away corner to call your own - somewhere to pause and stay awhile.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Act fast if you want it early as there's only 34 copies left on <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. The main release is due later this year and will also be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1638500/The_Garden_Path/" target="_blank">Steam</a> then.</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Party Starter coming this &#39;Summer&#39; with more localization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Jackbox Party Starter has been announced to launch this "Summer", which will be the perfect entry to get the party started with more languages supported.</p>
<p>It's not quite a "new", as it's a bundling of three existing games with Quiplash 3, Trivia Murder Party 2 and Tee K.O. However, they are all getting a big update for it. All games will support English, French, Italian, German and Spanish. Not just full subtitles but all of the voice actor dialog will be fully translated they said.</p>
<p>On top of that some new settings found in their 8th full pack will be coming to the starter including family-friendly filters, moderation, text filtering plus updated pause and settings menus. They also teased "some top secret new features that are going to be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 9" will be in this starter pack too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets per-app performance profiles, hardware survey and loads more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another absolutely <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216144458727332893" target="_blank">huge update</a> for the Steam Deck just landed, with Valve clearly taking on lots of feedback to make it the best handheld gaming device around.</p>
<p>The first big one is that you can now add a performance profile for each title. By default the main system settings are used, and when toggling on a profile for the currently running title is then created with all changes saved and automatically applied on launching. Pictures below (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1845169841652308926gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1845169841652308926gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1059037291652308925gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1059037291652308925gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is going to be fantastic for just getting the most out of each game, without having to constantly change settings in the performance menu. No doubt Valve will continue expanding that, perhaps even allow sharing like you can for Steam Input configurations.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those curious to know how well the Steam Deck is doing, we're going to perhaps get a better look at that next month, as Valve has now hooked up the Steam Hardware Survey properly for the Steam Deck. So maybe we'll see even better numbers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/linux-user-share-on-steam-hits-second-highest-percentage-in-years/" target="_blank">than seen recently</a>.</p>
<p>More work is being done on sorting out external displays, as we come closer to the release of the official dock. As now when you're connected to an external display, the Steam Deck interface is scaled to virtual 1280x800 resolution and Valve say "more work on this feature and functionality is underway".</p>
<p>Some of the other additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance when switching from offline to online modes</li>
<li>Improved availability of home screen sections when switching from offline to online modes</li>
<li>Added the Bulgarian Phonetic Traditional and Phonetic keyboard layouts</li>
<li>Corrected the interaction between CapsLock and Shift</li>
<li>The keyboard shows AltGr symbol hints when AltGr is not active</li>
<li>The keyboard only shows AltGr symbols when AltGr is active</li>
<li>Non-ASCII characters work in desktop mode</li>
<li>Removed rumble &amp; haptics toggles from the Quick Access menu. These can be accessed in the Settings &gt; Controller Settings page.</li>
<li>Moved Re-order Controllers button to the Other section in the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Added a "Stop Streaming" option to the Power menu when hosting a Remote Play session</li>
<li>Updated Recently Played games list to include streamed games</li>
<li>Plus a bunch of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA releases open source Linux GPU kernel modules, Beta Driver 515.43.04 out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a nice big win for open source, NVIDIA has today <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-releases-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/" target="_blank">officially revealed</a> that they've released open source Linux GPU kernel modules. Additionally, driver version 515.43.04 is out. This is a huge step and hopefully the sign of more to come from NVIDIA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release is a significant step toward improving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux, for tighter integration with the OS and for developers to debug, integrate, and contribute back. For Linux distribution providers, the open-source modules increase ease of use. They also improve the out-of-the-box user experience to sign and distribute the NVIDIA GPU driver. Canonical and SUSE are able to immediately package the open kernel modules with Ubuntu and SUSE Linux Enterprise Distributions.</p>
<cite>NVIDIA</cite></blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA say that with each new driver release, they will be publishing the sources mentioned on GitHub, and they will be accepting contributions from the community and other developers.</p>
<p>For now, data center GPUs are "production ready" but normal GeForce and Workstation GPUs (what we all use) are at an "alpha quality" for Turing and Ampere but NVIDIA plans to continue improving on it and "fully featured GeForce and Workstation support will follow in subsequent releases and the NVIDIA Open Kernel Modules will eventually supplant the closed-source driver". NVIDIA has also been working with the likes of Canonical, Red Hat, and SUSE for better packaging and deployment of it all.</p>
<p>There's still quite a long road ahead, as NVIDIA say it currently doesn't conform to the upstream Linux kernel design and so can't go upstream yet but they have plans to work on "an upstream approach" with help again from Canonical, Red Hat, and SUSE. For now, NVIDIA say it can serve as a way to also "help improve the Nouveau driver" since it will be able to use the same firmware as the main proprietary NVIDIA driver.</p>
<p>As for the driver release version 515.43.04, here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier Vulkan extensions. To use this functionality, the nvidia-drm kernel module must be loaded with DRM KMS mode setting enabled. See the DRM KMS section of the README for guidance on enabling mode setting.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-suspend.service, nvidia-resume.service, and nvidia-hibernate.service to use WantedBy= rather than RequiredBy=dependencies for systemd-suspend.service and systemd-hibernate.service.This avoids a problem where suspend or hibernate fails if the NVIDIA driver is uninstalled without disabling these services first.<br/>
	See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21991<br/>
	If these services were manually enabled, it may be necessary to update their dependencies by running sudo systemctl reenable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-hibernate.service</li>
<li>Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance of the quit dialog was thus also removed.</li>
<li>Removed the warning message about mismatches between the compiler used to build the Linux kernel and the compiler used to build the NVIDIA kernel modules from nvidia-installer. Modern compilers are less likely to cause problems when this type of mismatch occurs, and it has become common in many distributions to build the Linux kernel with a different compiler than the default system compiler.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to skip test-loading the kernel modules on systems where no supported NVIDIA GPUs are detected.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to avoid a race condition which could cause the kernel module test load to fail due to udev automatically loading kernel modules left over from an existing NVIDIA driver installation. This failure resulted in an installation error message "Kernel module load error: File exists".</li>
<li>Updated the RTD3 Video Memory Utilization Threshold (NVreg_DynamicPowerManagementVideoMemoryThreshold) maximum value from 200 MB to 1024 MB.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With those changes, it means the start of support for <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> on NVIDIA drivers too!</p>
<p>Source code up on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, driver release <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/187834/en" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, you can read the take from Red Hat's Christian F.K. Schaller on it <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/05/11/why-is-the-open-source-driver-release-from-nvidia-so-important-for-linux/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: oh, and remember how NVIDIA wanted to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-play-proton-could-get-direct-support-for-nvidia-image-scaling/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Image Scaling into Proton</a>? Well, a Pull Request is now up for Gamescope <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/488" target="_blank">support</a>, where it might be more likely to be accepted since it makes a bit more sense there perhaps.</p>

      <title>Humble put up a &#39;Handheld PC Power Bundle&#39; of games ready for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Got a Steam Deck or another handheld PC? Well, this latest one is just for you. Humble have put up a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/handheld-pc-power-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Handheld PC Power Bundle of games</a>.</p>
<p>All of the games included are either Steam Deck Verified or Playable, so clearly Humble Bundle have been paying attention to the wider industry. Not surprising, considering how popular the Steam Deck and anything surrounding it continues to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the games included in the bundle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exanima (Verified)</li>
<li>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries (Playable)</li>
<li>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden - Deluxe Edition (Playable)</li>
<li>Neon Abyss (Verified)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! 2 - Complete (Playable)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! 3 (Verified)</li>
<li>Paint the Town Red (Verified)</li>
<li>Parkasaurus (Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/handheld-pc-power-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Check out the bundle</a> if interested.</p>
<p>Have to admit my finger is hovering over the trigger for this, Parkasaurus looks wonderful. Somewhat amusing though is how they say "Handheld Verified" or "Handheld Playable", likely as there's all sorts of rules around advertising and using the Steam Deck name directly.</p>

      <title>XIVLauncher now on Linux, gets FINAL FANTASY XIV Online running on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the newer official launcher for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/39210/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online/" target="_blank">FINAL FANTASY XIV Online</a> is incredibly problematic with Steam Play Proton, a third-party launcher has recently come to Linux to help with that.</p>
<p>A game I know a great many people enjoyed, and now that <a href="https://goatcorp.github.io/" target="_blank">XIVLauncher</a> is properly available for Linux and installable from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/dev.goats.xivlauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, it should allow more people to continue playing on Linux and the Steam Deck. The team behind it even set up a <a href="https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/steamdeck" target="_blank">full guide</a> to getting it running on Steam Deck. It even includes a special build of Wine that has been tuned just for getting FINAL FANTASY XIV Online running nicely.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3112935651652285125gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3112935651652285125gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully at some point it won't be needed, if Square Enix can look at the issues with their official launcher, but once again the community delivers to get a game more easily playable on Linux and Steam Deck. Currently, it has an Unsupported rating for the Steam Deck, largely due to the launcher. So if you wanted to get FINAL FANTASY XIV Online working on Linux and Steam Deck — this is for you!</p>
<p>As always with third-party launchers, use at your own risk.</p>

      <title>Little Inferno gets a newer Linux port, and improved Steam Deck compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Little Inferno, a 2012 classic from Tomorrow Corporation recently put up a fresh upgrade to keep it looking good. One of the early Linux ports, it seems it's had a bit of extra love lately. A popular game back when it originally released and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam.</p>
<p>A thoroughly strange and unique game about setting things on fire, earning coins for doing so to buy more things to burn and perhaps a little more. I must confess I hadn't really put much time into it before this update but it's a delightful little game with no filler.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="En8cIVlj2Jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad55c32dc1e89ad6fdcca1fa1dccdb18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/En8cIVlj2Jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On May 10th the update notes state it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new linux port using SDL2.</li>
<li>Provide improved compatibility with Steam deck</li>
<li>Native 64bit linux support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently Steam Deck Verified, although that was done using the Windows version with Proton.</p>
<p>Curiously, I got a strange buzzing sound instead of some of the audio with the new 64bit version of the game. Deleting the "libopenal.so.1" file in the "lib64" folder seemed to solve that. No issues after that.</p>
<p>So far it looks like only the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221260/Little_Inferno/" target="_blank">Steam</a> version has been updated with <a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.itch.io/little-inferno" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/little_inferno" target="_blank">GOG</a> not currently up to date.</p>

      <title>Retro Commander is a free-ish new RTS that brings on the nostalgia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Retro Commander from developer Noble Master is a free to play RTS that just landed on Steam in Early Access, and so far it seems to be pretty great and fills me up with nostalgia. Growing up with the likes of Dune 2, Total Annihilation, Red Alert I'm always on the lookout for new classic-styled base-building strategy games like this. So far, it seems like Retro Commander might hit the mark.</p>
<p>The developer explains that the focus is on two parts: a fun single-player that contains both a story campaign and skirmish battles, along with equally fun online multiplayer. The online experience also feature cross-platform play and a ranking system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0wzpzOAUzWw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90b3142fb387c1a3153fa1ea4514ec47.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0wzpzOAUzWw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As it's a free to play game, it does offer micro-transactions and the free version is pretty limited with a $9.99 cost to unlock all the maps. For such a strategy game, the price seems <em>reasonable</em> and it's interesting to see more developers test out this hybrid model of letting people in to play with no time restriction to test and then pay if they like it.</p>
<p>When it comes to the gameplay, it feels like a strange mix between the classic Red Alert and Supreme Commander. You get the retro-style with a pretty pleasing look and then the sweet tactical zoom to get an easy glance at what's going on. Feels quite a lot like a more polished and coherently styled version of Rusted Warfare, another great 2D RTS.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><u>Post-Apocalyptic</u>: Real-time strategy (RTS) played in a post-apocalyptic timeline on Mother Earth. The environment includes day-night cycles, rain, snow, wind and solar flare activity.</li>
<li><u>Story Campaign</u>: Deep campaign and story line of humanity after a cataclysmic event. Factions come with their own specialized <strong>technologies</strong> such as stealth, robots, drones or shields.</li>
<li><u>Single &amp; Multiplayer</u>: A challenging AI for both single and multiplayer matches with co-op play. Cross-platform multiplayer including <strong>LAN</strong>/internet. ONLINE play comes with an award and rating system.</li>
<li><u>Play Modes</u>: In addition to regular skirmish matches, the game supports missions such as elimination, survival, <strong>capture the flag</strong>, defense and <strong>battle royale</strong>. Available in both single and multiplayer also are escort and rescue missions.</li>
<li><u>Structures &amp; Troops</u>: Common troops for land, sea and air warfare is available to all factions. Specialized elements such as stealth, shields, <strong>EMP</strong> weapons, nukes, <strong>portals</strong>, orbital weapons, assimilator and other troops and structures provide for additional variety.</li>
<li><u>Modding</u>: A map editor is included allowing for player-modded maps including player-modded campaigns. All elements including troops, structures, as well as graphics and sound effects, can be modded if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During the course of Early Access the developer plans to finish the campaign, improve the AI and add more maps. They estimate it will remain in Early Access for 4-12 months.</p>
<p>You can grab it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/338820/Retro_Commander/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://noblemaster.itch.io/retro-commander" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>CurseForge modding client comes to Linux in Alpha, only supports WoW for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CurseForge, the popular game modding client, has now officially released an early Alpha version for Linux. Since it's early, and they're starting slow, for now it only supports mods / addons for World of Warcraft (Wine) although they do have plans to continue expanding it. A bit of an odd one to start with though don't you think?</p>
<p>It's been through a few different hands like Amazon / Twitch, with the current owners being Overwolf. One of the reasons its so popular is not just because of the amount of games and mods it has, but mod authors can also earn monies from it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7808623351652272046gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7808623351652272046gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - CurseForge on Linux</em></p>
<p>Some of the current known issues include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="collapse in highlighted-anchor" id="linux" style="height: auto;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Switching between flavors and installing addons will cause an error</strong>
<p>Navigate to a different page (e.g "My Addons") and then install the desired addon.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Navigating to "My Addons" while installing an addon will create 3 instances of the same file</strong>
<p>Shouldn't impact anything besides the UI. Change to another page and back to fix it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relaunch will close the App</strong><br/>
	Close the app and then open it manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deleting addons and reopening CF will cause the addons to be "modified"</strong><br/>
	This is a known issue, shouldn't affect anything besides the UI itself. We are working on a fix for the next upcoming versions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll be following it along now, so we can report on any major updates when they happen. As always, do <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/email-us/" target="_blank">email in</a> if you see something we don't.</p>
<p>Download it <a href="https://download.curseforge.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. The Linux version is an AppImage, so it should hopefully work well across different Linux distros.</p>

      <title>Wolfire versus Valve antitrust lawsuit to continue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After it seeming like Valve might have won in the lawsuit from Wolfire Game, the story appears to be far from over.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/wolfire-versus-valve-antitrust-lawsuit-dismissed/" target="_blank">Last we heard</a> it was in part being dismissed, seemingly like Valve had the upper hand as Wolfire didn't have sufficient evidence of their claims. Now though, as reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/class-action/valve-loses-bid-to-end-antitrust-case-over-steam-gaming-platform" target="_blank">Bloomberg Law</a>, part of the case has been allowed to continue as the judge now seems to believe that it's "plausible" Valve uses their position to mess with the market in their favour.</p>
<p>The issue here, as before, is that Wolfire claim that Valve and Steam use a "most favoured nation" clause with a mixture of "written and unwritten rules" to "prevent price competition from rival storefronts". Wolfire are again sticking to their claim that Valve would remove games from Steam that are found cheaper elsewhere, noting that a "Steam account manager" told Wolfire that Valve would "delist any games available for sale at a lower price elsewhere, whether or not using Steam keys" and it's this that has the judge saying "These allegations are sufficient to plausibly allege unlawful conduct" and so it's going to continue on that point.</p>
<p>Other claims like the 30% cut Valve take being "supracompetitive", and another antitrust issue of Valve tying together the Steam Store and Steam Platform seem to be dismissed.</p>
<p>Whenever we hear what happens next, we'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 36 is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Linux 36 is officially out now, after a number of delays as the Fedora team don't like to rush things out when they're not ready. Here's what's new.</p>
<p>With their main desktop edition being Fedora Workstation which is now running <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gnome-42-released-with-the-new-global-dark-style-preference/" target="_blank">GNOME 42</a>, they tend to stick to plain vanilla GNOME and not make too many tweaks there. So there's no big extra special bells and whistles when it comes to Fedora releases that you wouldn't have seen in new versions of GNOME. Fedora's Matthew Miller mentions "Fedora Workstation focuses on the desktop, and in particular, it’s geared toward users who want a “just works” Linux operating system experience.".</p>
<p>Fedora continues it's "<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_first" target="_blank">First</a>" foundation to include all the latest software so expect tons of upgrades to everything. For NVIDIA users, be aware that Fedora 36 now defaults to Wayland. Hopefully you won't see too many issues but they seem to think it's stable enough. A curious one though, since NVIDIA <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm3/+bug/1969566" target="_blank">requested</a> the folks at Canonical to go back to X11 for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21341442511652195086gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21341442511652195086gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You'll find with Fedora 36 the likes of Linux Kernel 5.17, Mesa 22.0 drivers and OpenSSL 3.0 and so it should work nicely with the latest hardware.</p>
<p>You can download it from the <a href="https://getfedora.org/" target="_blank">official Fedora website</a>. Their various <a href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Spins</a> were also updated for those of you who prefer KDE Plasma, Xfce, Cinnamon and more.</p>
<p>If you do plan an upgrade from 35 to 36, ensure you've run all your normal updates first, as some "very important upgrade-related bugs" have been solved.</p>
<p>Sometime over the next week I'll be doing the upgrade, hopefully it will go smoothly. As this will be likely my first full distro version upgrade ever when using Fedora.</p>

      <title>Intel gives an unclear update on when to expect Intel Arc GPU availability</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel are set to fully enter the dedicated GPU game soon with Intel Arc, although we're still in for a bit of a wait. Writing in a fresh <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/Gaming/Engineering-Arc-5-9-2022/post/1383055" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they did their own little Q&amp;A session with Lisa Pearce, Vice President and General Manager for the Visual Compute Group at Intel.</p>
<p>The problem is, they're still not being very clear about the worldwide availability, and this blog post didn't exactly help.</p>
<p>To sum it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Arc for mobile / laptop so far only has Samsung who started in Korea, and they're "expanding globally". Intel Arc 3 for mobile will be due "ASAP", with Intel Arc 5 and Arc 7 graphics for mobile "in early summer".</li>
<li>For desktops they will start in China for the entry level Intel Arc A-series (A3), this is just for system builders and OEMs in "Q2". Following along "shortly" China will also see retail sales, as Intel say strong demand and how close China is to the supply makes the most sense and then their "next step" is to go global with no date mentioned for the entry level.</li>
<li>Intel Arc A5 and A7 desktop cards will be "later this summer" for OEMs and system integrators worldwide, with "component sales" worldwide some unnamed time after.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intel being about as clear as mud here. Overall though, we should eventually see all the main dedicated Intel Arc series models by the end of Summer / start of Autumn 2022 worldwide by the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Part of the problem are their drivers, which just aren't in a ready state, and this was hinted at with Pearce mentioning "some software readiness delays".</p>
<p>So there you have it, that's the latest on Intel Arc release dates.</p>

      <title>VITURE One XR glasses look fun paired up with a Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Perhaps an answer to "Deck Neck" where your neck starts to hurt staring down at the Steam Deck? I'm certainly curious to give the VITURE One XR glasses a go.</p>
<p>The VITURE One glasses enable you to connect them up to various devices, to act like a 120" virtual screen so you can be completely absorbed into what you're doing. For the Steam Deck specifically, what we're obviously interested in primarily here, the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the increasing popularity of the Steam Deck, VITURE One will be huge for Steam Deck owners. The best part of Steam Deck is its portability. You can play it anywhere, anytime. But bending over a small screen for lengths of time is uncomfortable. Instead, connect your Steam Deck to VITURE One XR glasses to unlock a 120-inch virtual screen instead!</p>
<p>Together with Steam Deck, VITURE One will be a game changer in the gaming industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you get according to their included specifications is a virtual 120" display at 1080p and 60FPS, with a "PPD (pixels per degree) of 55 - roughly the equivalent of 300-400 PPI on a physical screen(Retina Display)". They include speakers too, providing spatial sound and the glasses will brighten and dim as needed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TJ_5nGFObjY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1687cfc289c662785448899e65700859.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TJ_5nGFObjY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a few extra features and add-on devices, some of which don't work with the Steam Deck. There's a lot more to it though, and a lot of devices supported — even cloud gaming. The nerd in me wants a pair.</p>
<p>You can check out the project on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/viture/viture-game-and-stream-anywhere-anytime" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, and it's already funded with 15 days left.</p>

      <title>Sorted by revenue, the Steam Deck has been the number 1 top seller for 4 weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not exactly a big surprise given the price but the Steam Deck has managed to stay at number 1 of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2022W18/" target="_blank">Steam Weekly Global Top Sellers</a> list.</p>
<p>This is sorted by revenue, not by the amount of units sold. Sadly, we don't know how exactly many units that is since Valve don't actually give out direct numbers like that, so for now this is the best indicator we have of its performance. It has managed to do so for 4 consecutive weeks now too! Not only that, it's been in the top 5 for 9 weeks.</p>
<p>It's such a stark contrast the Steam Machines, which you can read some history on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">in my previous editorial</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously when the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-was-the-steam-top-seller-for-the-week-ending-april-17/" target="_blank">initially jumped to 1st place</a>, it's going up against some multi-million sellers like Elden Ring so all things considered — it's a thoroughly good showing for Valve's newest entry into the hardware market and it continues to be the most important thing in years for Linux Gaming.</p>
<p>Also, today, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the Steam Deck has hit 2,666 games set as Verified or Playable. Some recent Verified titles include: Serial Cleaner, Peaky Blinders: Mastermind, Owlboy, Wave Break and Escape Simulator.</p>

      <title>Vagrus - The Riven Realms, a deep and difficult RPG adds a new companion, keybinds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vagrus - The Riven Realms, an impressive deep and challenging turn-based fantasy RPG has a big post-release update out now, which brings a new companion.</p>
<p>A multi-award winning game, with a strong focus on the narrative (you need to love to read for this one), open-world exploration and lots of strategy elements make up a thoroughly unique experience for fans of RPGs and turn-based combat — along with plenty of trading and decision making. You lead a caravan through a completely ruined world hit by multiple cataclysmic events that's created a dark and strange world.</p>
<p>With the new update out, it adds in a new Companion to the game: the garrulous Undead cook called Vorax, who brings new perks to the table such as his Deputy role Supercargo, as well as his cooking during camping and combat Skills that make him a great support fighter. He comes with his own, expansive Loyalty quest chain, which involves a cooking challenge as well as a less gleeful delve in his dark past.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q6mJQAPYOTg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70011ecf3314b51ed7cc46031a5d3660.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q6mJQAPYOTg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer told me over email this "is the first in a series of downloadable content forthcoming for Vagrus".</p>
<p>Some combat changes came along with this too like "Initiative Track Changes", which they say provide "more immediate agency to the player during combat and to brush things up for increased visual clarity, we’ve adjusted combat design so that changes to Initiative will take effect from the active moment when they occur". Characters who are downed or stunned show up properly too, along with visual changes to show their state.</p>
<p>Many people will also rejoice at this: keybinds are in the game now too, so you can customize what key does what. Additionally there's a number of UI improvements and bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley hits 20 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardew Valley, the peaceful farming life sim from ConcernedApe has hit over 20 million sales two years on from hitting 10 million. While the creator has moved onto the next project, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/haunted-chocolatier-announced-from-stardew-valley-creator/" target="_blank">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, it seems there's no stopping the massive amount of sales on Stardew.</p>
<p>You can see the new figure noted on the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank">official press page</a>, which notes the 20 million figure was crossed in March 2022. 13 million of those were sold on PC, with the rest split across the many platforms the game supports.</p>
<p>Looking over previous dates, it seems it's managed to gain 10 million sales in two years at a continuing rate of around 5 million a year. Pretty incredible for an indie game but goes to show that there's plenty of room for games that don't glorify violence in some form.</p>
<p>Fully deserved too of course, it's a wonderful game that's seen plenty of big free content updates over the years.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for Epic &amp; GOG gets themes, platform selection, favourites</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher continues evolving to provide a way to manage your Epic Games and GOG libraries on Linux and other platforms with a fresh Beta release out now.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta.2" target="_blank">version 2.3.0 Beta 2</a>, another chance for people test before the next full release. One of the major additions is support for themes, so you can pick from a few built-in and no doubt they will expand it over time. Currently, it's just tweaking the colours. See the default (left) versus Dracula theme (right) — click to enlarge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13911315751652089019gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13911315751652089019gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14870691571652089018gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14870691571652089018gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When installing a game for Linux and macOS, there's now a platform selection option so you can install the Windows version instead if a Native version exists (the choice is yours). You might find a Windows version with Wine to work better than a really old and unmaintained Linux version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6979892901652089451gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6979892901652089451gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can also favourite a game, you can hide or replace the Recently Played row with Favourites, GOG should work properly on Windows, you can sort installed games by title and installing status and a mixtures of UI fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Steady progress on a brilliant open source app.</p>

      <title>Wave Break from Funktronic Labs gets a major update and Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wave Break, originally a timed-exclusive for Stadia that released on Steam in June 2021 just had a big upgrade, which also included a new Native Linux version. Not only that, it's also Steam Deck Verified now too with this Native Linux build.</p>
<p>Never seen it before? Imagine skateboarding — with boats. Inspired by skateboarding classics, you will grind, grab, kickflip and shoot your way through an explosive 80s crime-filled Miami Vice themed world.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MSzjrIDN30g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b77d7820a202e1fa6dec905194b79452.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MSzjrIDN30g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the gameplay changes that came with the update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new cosmetic items!</li>
<li>Changed the menu text for "Online Lobbies" to "Custom Games" to make it more clear.</li>
<li>Fix for semi transparent Park Creator previews for non stroke items on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Made the first COMBO mission in the game a bit easier to complete on the initial lower stats.</li>
<li>Updated internal Steamworks.NET</li>
<li>The Tutorial now requests that you do some of the steps 3 times, in an effort to help people remember the controls better.</li>
<li>The Tutorial now has an additional step of completing a single 1,000 point combo.</li>
<li>Lowered the Campaign "Next Level" requirement from 60% to 30%.</li>
<li>The initial stats on Big Pin have been upped by 2 or 3 per stat (mostly Grind and Automatic balance).</li>
<li>Rescheduled all events to end at midnight PST instead of UTC.</li>
<li>Events now show the final results the second the event is over, instead of the following day.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see it arrive like this, as last I spoke to the developer they were a bit dismissive of doing a Linux version at all outside of Stadia. Seems the Steam Deck has pushed more developers to do this so they can make it work as best as possible.</p>

      <title>ScummVM adds support for the 1995 shooter Wetlands from Hypnotix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic gets a new life thanks to ScummVM, which just recently added support for the 1995 shooter Wetlands.</p>
<p>Work on this and the HYPNO game engine has been ongoing for some time now, with the team mentioning that it's now properly <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220506/" target="_blank">ready for some public testing</a>.</p>
<p>"This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.</p>
<p>Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16653173131652087233gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The release with ScummVM supports English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean languages with improvements made to the controls.</p>

      <title>fheroes2 for Heroes of Might and Magic II improves hotkeys, cursors and languages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>fheroes2, a game engine reimplementation for Heroes of Might and Magic II, has another release out further improving the game for various platforms.</p>
<p>Continuing to be the best choice to play this classic, the developers working on it have continued to expand what's possible. Featuring support for the Black and White cursors, they said "Now some players can enjoy the perfection of monochrome graphics". Hotkey support was expanded too with a separate window where you can view them all to make it easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3141693381652086626gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3141693381652086626gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14609934571652086628gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14609934571652086628gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game configuration window was also expanded so you can tune sound effects and music directly, along with other new options. The campaign was upgraded again with pop-up windows for awards and bonuses, so now "every player would know what to expect and how to plan the strategy to win the next scenario". Even more AI improvements came too as the AI can now use the View All spell, the AI will explore more and roam around and AI heroes can now also "properly navigate within narrow paths and they better manage mana consumption".</p>
<p>Main quick highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rework hotkey logic and add an in-game window to read all hotkeys within the game</li>
<li>Improve AI behavior on map: it is able to use View All spell, it manages mana more efficiently and it explores the map more often</li>
<li>Add images and description for every campaign's bonus and award by right clicking on them</li>
<li>Add basic support of Ukrainian language and update French, Russian, Polish and Norwegian translations</li>
<li>Add Black/White cursor support</li>
<li>Expand Text Support Mode and made it as an in-game option</li>
<li>Fix multiple issues in battle logic and spell interaction on map</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>50</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.14 release</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine 7.8 is out now with X11 and OSS drivers converted to PE</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). A new biweekly development release is out now with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.8" target="_blank">Wine 7.8</a>. It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights in Wine 7.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>X11 and OSS drivers converted to PE.</li>
<li>WoW64 support in the sound drivers.</li>
<li>Number formatting using the new locale database.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's sometimes asked: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>With this release 37 bugs were listed as solved like issues for: Assassin's Creed IV - Black Flag, Guilty Gear XX #Reload, The Evil Within, Command and Conquer Generals and various other miscellaneous fixes.</p>
<p>If you're looking for help managing Wine, I can happily suggest you go take a look at <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>. Great software that really helps deal with it all.</p>

<li>A mystical world inhabited by spirits with celtic and tribal vibes.</li>
<li>A randomly generated world map with tons of levels, bosses and events to be discovered.</li>

<li>Upgrade your spells and spirits the way you want.</li>
<li>Easy to learn, hard to master - chill and challenge modes suitable for any player.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The whimsical world of Oaken was heavily inspired by Celtic mythology, mixed with a child-like nostalgia from our favorite games growing up,” said Johann Verbroucht, founder and manager at Goblinz Publishing. “We hope players will enjoy the fable-like figurines and folklore-inspired soundtrack, and immerse themselves in the experience!”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1348690/Oaken/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. Also on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/oaken" target="_blank">GOG</a> but no Linux build yet.</p>

      <title>Cannibal Crossing seeing plenty of tweaks for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cannibal Crossing, an action-survival game for 1-4 players from development teams at Rocketcat Games (Death Road to Canada) / Everplay Interactive / Blow and Try Again, continues evolving and gets some nice Steam Deck improvements.</p>
<p><em>It's currently in Early Access, with a planned full release on May 26.</em></p>
<p>"Cannibal Crossing is an over the top action-survival game where you must explore a randomly generated town while scavenging, building a base, fighting hordes of deadly foes, and searching for a way to escape! Along the way, you'll encounter bandits, cannibals and beasts (mostly cannibals) – as well as other survivors. Face increasingly large swarms of enemies as you add to and improve your arsenal of weapons."</p>

<p>As it's approaching release, the developers have been tweaking lots of the gameplay to make it feel better. One part of these updates has been improvements to controller support to make it work better. For the Steam Deck specifically, they put in work to adjust for the screen size and fix up the UI along with adjustments to tutorials and early game tips to make them better on Steam Deck and other controllers.</p>
<p>Nice to see developers of all sizes working to improve gaming on the Steam Deck.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In need of a fresh point and click comedy adventure? Catie in MeowmeowLand from developer ARTillery is now supported on Linux with a new Native build. Must admit I hadn't heard of this one before but the screenshots instantly make it look worth playing.</p>
<p>"Catie in MeowmeowLand is a beautiful traditional point-and-click adventure game set in a bizarre world of cats and ludicrous characters. As Catie follows a strange white cat in her garden she suddenly finds herself in a mysterious world of MeowmeowLand, where she has to undergo a journey to find her way back home. Your task is to help Catie get there!"</p>

      <title>Controller support for Path of Exile leaving Beta, should work great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" target="_blank">Path of Exile</a>, the free to play ARPG from Grinding Gear Games, is getting close to releasing the Sentinel update and along with masses of gameplay additions — controller support will leave Beta.</p>
<p>With controller / gamepad support all hooked up fully, this should give a much better experience for players on the Steam Deck. Main controller changes include (<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3264788" target="_blank">full patch notes</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Controller Support for Path of Exile is no longer in Beta.</li>
<li>Added support for DualShock 4 Controllers.</li>
<li>Added PvP Support for controllers.</li>
<li>It is now possible to manually select a controller to use under the Input Options if there are multiple controllers connected.</li>
<li>It is now possible to navigate to and select Private Leagues and Events in the Character Selection Menu with a controller.</li>
<li>It is now possible to navigate and interact with the chat window when using a controller.</li>
<li>Attempting to load an Item Filter when using a controller will now output success or failure messages to the chat window.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update is due to launch on May 13, 2022 and I'll be sure to take a look at how it runs on both the Steam Deck and desktop Linux around the time.</p>

      <title>An interview with Aaron Honeycutt from System76</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's time for a fresh interview. Today I have Aaron Honeycutt from <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a>, makers of Linux distribution Pop!_OS and various hardware, who talked a little about their work.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Could you please introduce yourself and what you do?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Heyo! I’m Aaron and I work at System76 as a Happiness Architect.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: How did you get started with Linux? What attracted you to it?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I started around Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or so and I wanted to try something different from Windows (or macOS since I couldn’t afford the hardware). In the early days I was dual booting like most folks and this helped when I broke something in Windows and I fixed it from Ubuntu which was amazing to me at the time!</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What does being a ‘Happiness Architect’ actually involve? How the heck do you land a cool job title like that?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>A Happiness Architect is pretty much Tier 2 for our support though currently I’m the only one with the title. I work in our support system, Slack, Discord and social media to help folks get up and running or fix issues.</p>
<p>I pretty much created the title as we don’t actually have a Tier system in support but since I’ve been here the longest other than Emma of course I wanted a title that fit my experience and the internal/external joke of the fact that I run Arch.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s it really like to work for System76? What’s your work setup like?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>It’s pretty fantastic! I work in the warehouse as the only support person there as we are all remote (in other parts of the country as well). We also have a few office doggos from time to time though my dog Onyxia is in the office every day.</p>
<p>I’m the main point of contact for when something is shipped in or needs to be shipped out. I can also test something for customers using QA systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13215513841651662971gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13215513841651662971gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: System76 is a hardware vendor as well as a software vendor with desktops, a mini-PC, laptops, servers — and now a keyboard too (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">my review here</a>). Why a keyboard?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>The keyboard felt like the next step as it gives you even more control of your hardware and shapes your experience with your OS. You can also configure the keyboard on either Windows, macOS or Linux depending on what you use to unleash your potential.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Since you’re a Linux vendor, do you ever see much interest from the Windows crowd?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>While in support I do see quite a few people need to use Windows on our hardware usually for some software/hardware that they need. A lot of them apologize that they are even loading Windows on our hardware which is not needed!</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: I’ve seen the CEO, Carl Richell, share some quick videos of your hardware production on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/carlrichell/status/1519427569854132238" target="_blank">example</a>) and it’s kind of mesmerizing. Do you ever find yourself sneaking off to watch it all?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Since my partner works in Production I often find myself out in the factory either watching them finish the coat on a Thelio veneer before it is put on the side of the chassis, watching a 3D printer run a bit or someone making a bottle opener with our rocket logo on it.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Why should someone pick Pop!_OS over something like Ubuntu or Fedora or even Arch?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Pop!_OS includes a lot of the packages/software that folks add/enable during or after the installation of the OS. For example having flatpak/flathub installed and configured out of the box saves you a reboot and allows you to install your favorite packages out of the gate.</p>
<p>I myself install Slack, Mattermost, Discord and a few others this way. One of my favorites is Pop Shell which enables titling of windows which I use every single day.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Any plans to bring the Pop experience to other desktop environments (and other distributions?), or will you be sticking with GNOME?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>We have been actively encouraging other distros add features like Pop Shell and provide documentation for building our software such as this support article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell" target="_blank">https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell</a></p>
<p>We are also working on making sure that the COSMIC DE (not based on GNOME) will be easy to port to other distro so that everyone can enjoy it and help improve it as it evolves.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Back in 2020, System76’s Principal Engineer Jeremy Soller put a poll on <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller/status/1417464682164547586" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to see interest in a rolling release of Pop!_OS. Are there any plans for it to happen, what are your thoughts on it?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Pop!_OS is currently a semi-rolling/half-rolling release. We push out newer versions of core packages that improve gaming like Mesa, the kernel, Steam, Lutris and many others.</p>
<p>While we don't plan to change our approach yet, we are considering options to offer an always fresh archive to our users.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Linux packaging is a little, dare I say it, messy right now. You have deb, rpm, AppImage, Snap, Flatpak and more. What are your thoughts on this, what do you prefer?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I personally prefer flatpaks no matter what distro I am using and I even use it on my Arch install. One of the neat things is that if you install them with the –user option they are installed in ~/.local which means backup programs like Deja Dup will back them up and they will be installed when you restore from that backup.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: A little while ago, a certain big YouTuber (hi <a href="https://youtu.be/0506yDSgU7M?t=637" target="_blank">Linus</a>) destroyed their install of Pop!_OS. What was it like to see such breakage be done so publicly, what have you learned from this?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I think this has reinforced the direction that OSTree (Immutable file systems) are going and certainly proves that Steam is right going that direction for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Anything in Pop-land that you’re particularly excited about right now?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I’m very excited to see the COSMIC DE come out and how folks will use it! I think it will strike a balance between awesome and useful features and control of your desktop as you want it.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s your personal opinion on what Linux really needs to get more user share on the desktop? What are the roadblocks here?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Introducing them to the OS is certainly difficult and having more hardware with it pre-installed certainly helps which is why I’m always happy to see more and more companies offer it.</p>
<p>When I introduced my partner to Pop!_OS it was because Windows just would not update and I tried fixing it but failed. Their main concern was if they could play WoW as that is what they used the laptop for mainly.</p>
<p>I showed them that they could pretty easily then backed up their files. They have been happy ever since! We built a custom desktop for them and I loaded Windows on another drive just in case for some games but they haven’t even booted into Windows for months since they can do everything they need in Pop!_OS most often without even asking me!</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Can you tell us your top 5 favourite games right now?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>That’s pretty tough!</p>
<ol>
<li>DOOM Eternal</li>
<li>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</li>
<li>Halo MCC</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West (PS5)</li>
<li>Warframe</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s your own personal computing setup like?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I have a custom desktop at home that I use for pretty much everything. It’s most likely overkill for what I need but it’s always nice to have that power when it is needed. All of my coworkers say I need a new GPU but they are aware of the current prices!</p>
<p>I have more spec info here:</p>

<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Will you be buying a Steam Deck? What is your opinion of it at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>My partner and I both ordered ours on the same day a few weeks ago (512GB models). I think it will affect so many parts of gaming outside of just Linux Gaming and I think we’ll see more studios work towards having their game work with Proton. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Big thank you to Aaron for joining me on this.</p>
<p><em>I'll have more interviews to come this month, stay tuned! <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/email-us/" target="_blank">Get in touch</a> if you want to be interviewed.</em></p>

      <title>Fortnite added to Xbox Cloud Gaming, easier than ever to play on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft has today announced that the massive free to play game Fortnite is now on Xbox Cloud Gaming, this makes it easier than ever to play it on Linux and Steam Deck. Of course, you first need to be registered with a Live / Xbox account but there's <u>no</u> subscription required to play this and overall it actually works far better than using GeForce NOW to stream it.</p>
<p>Tested working across both Chrome and Edge, at least until some day in the far future when Epic decide to get Fortnite running on Linux properly, this is likely the best way to do it.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure Chrome is installed (available via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library), or via Discover in Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>In Desktop Mode enter this into the Konsole terminal app: <code class="inline-code">flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code><br/>
	This enables the Deck Gamepad controller to work.</li>
<li>If you wish to auto-launch Xbox Cloud Gaming with Chrome, add this to the very end of the launch options (right click -&gt; properties on Chrome in Steam): <code class="inline-code">--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://xbox.com/play"</code></li>
<li>Go back to the main Gaming Mode on Steam Deck, tap Chrome in your Steam Library and set Steam Input (the Gamepad icon on the right) into Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad.</li>
<li>Launch Chrome, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a quick video of it in action:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1Q09qFclV1Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4320fa64c372cc6668d86a97f1219012.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1Q09qFclV1Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I also tested it working on my main Fedora Linux desktop and it works just fine in Chrome and Edge, although the resolution wasn't great on my 1080p monitor. On the Steam Deck, it looks just fine with the resolution.</p>
<p>This was possible with GeForce NOW (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/chrome-on-steam-deck-now-supports-the-deck-controller-with-geforce-now-working/" target="_blank">as shown by me before</a>), but the experience is a lot more fluid and there's less hassle with launcher logins and Fortnite seems to perform a lot better this way too.</p>

      <title>Owners of Dying Light get upgraded to the Enhanced Edition, final patch out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own the base game of Dying Light? Good news for you, as Techland are bumping everyone up to the full Enhanced Edition which includes The Following expansion. Plus a final patch is out now.</p>
<p>This means all owners of the game (on Steam at least) will get The Following expansion, Bozak Horde, Cuisine and Cargo, Ultimate Survivor bundle and the Crash Test skin bundle! You have to hand it to Techland here, not only have they supported the original Dying Light for many years but bumping everyone up when the sequel is out is pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>A rather big patch also just landed which includes a bunch of changes and additions for the Hellraid DLC including a new weapon, a reworked armory, new consumables, new bounties and other minor additions. Overall, they claim it's much more satisfying to play though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zjJTzW2TOCM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5294b0e95aac47d601e3b7b15b084171.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zjJTzW2TOCM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that the latest patch adds new tutorials for various parts of the game, new blueprints to craft, an overhaul to the Be The Zombie PvP mode, a bunch of bug fixes and the list goes on across two patch notes (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/239140/view/3182366126814239387" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/239140/view/3182366778716117091" target="_blank">#2</a>).</p>
<p>There's also a new event with the crazy engineer twins, Tolga and Fatin, having two new bounties available that are local for you and global for everyone with a new blueprint and 3 King Mods as rewards.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nVQnuoSj8pw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/237cd5f6b4899fc42a1e69711adcb970.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nVQnuoSj8pw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Dying Light is now 60% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a> until the 12th of May.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Space Bandit, a shoot &#39;em up roguelite with &#39;annoyingly clever AI&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love a twin-stick shooter? How about one that features apparently clever AI? Check out Space Bandit, which has a demo available right now.</p>
<p>On the surface, it looks like any other indie roguelite shooter with simple controls, pixel graphics and some procedural generation to keep things interesting for multiple runs. Where it gets interesting though is the AI. The developer said that the AI will "always work together to flank you, they'll call out your position to each other, they'll revive each other and generally make you suffer". After playing a few minutes of it, I can confirm it's a little challenging and actually thoroughly entertaining.</p>

<p>While the action is intense and the weapons are fun to use, the environment is also your weapon. You're in space, and so if you run out of bullets you might get a chance to smash a window and vent all your enemies out into space. I'm quite a fan of the teleport system too, that allows you when it's ready to teleport through enemies to another spot and watch them explode as you do it — glorious.</p>
<p>This is one to watch, do give the demo a try.</p>

      <title>Check out an hour of cancelled Half-Life game Ravenholm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ravenholm, one of the names that Arkane gave to their Half-Life game, was previously shown off <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/half-life-was-going-to-get-a-ravenholm-spin-off/" target="_blank">back in 2020</a> and now we have a lot more footage of it. Sadly it never and will never see gamers get their hands on it properly but at least now we can see what might have been.</p>
<p>This kind of thing coming out with Valve's approval is pretty rare, as Valve has historically not been overly communicative with the community, especially on the future of their games so this is quite special. To note, this is not a possible Half-Life 2: Episode 3, but an entirely different game with a new character.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can watch it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xMygnmB9Zw8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78df0cf2f574ebc4f369241176cda01f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xMygnmB9Zw8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I continue longing for more Half-Life in my life. After playing through Half-Life: Alyx, which was incredible, it's a shame that Valve don't make a lot of games now. Even Erik Wolpaw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/erik-wolpaw-to-valve-on-portal-3-we-should-just-do-it/" target="_blank">recently said</a> Valve should just make Portal 3 already. Previously, Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/valve-have-multiple-games-in-development-they-will-announce-says-gabe-newell/" target="_blank">Gabe Newell did mention</a> they had more games on the way and this was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/01/valve-steam-deck-interview" target="_blank">repeated by designer Greg Coomer</a> recently too. So who knows, maybe late this year we might see another? One can hope.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 2,500 games Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big milestone has been hit for the Steam Deck from Valve. There's now at least 2,500 games that have been through Deck Verified to be classed as either fully Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>That's another 500 or so <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/2000-titles-officially-hit-for-steam-deck-as-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">since early April</a>, when they hit 2,000 showing good progress on getting more games through the system. Still, a long way to go before the full Steam Library is checked with tens of thousands and more releasing every day.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the latest numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1321 - Verified</li>
<li>1179 - Playable</li>
<li>1179 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>One important bit to remember is that a game that hasn't been through Deck Verified yet, doesn't mean it won't work. You can try to play <em>anything</em>, and realistically the number that <em>does</em> work will be a lot <em>higher</em> than the official number. There's also a few noted as Unsupported, which actually do work. There's also a few problems with certain Verified and Playable games which may not work right, which Valve continue to work on improving their verification for.</p>
<p>Some of the latest to be Verified or Playable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persona 4 Golden - Verified (although it was already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">playable with GE-Proton</a>)</li>
<li>Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 - Playable</li>
<li>Beat Invaders - Verified</li>
<li>Children of Morta - Verified</li>
<li>Gone Home - Verified</li>
<li>Loot River - Verified</li>
<li>RUINER - Verified</li>
</ul>

      <title>The deb-get tool helps Ubuntu (and derivative distro) fans grab extra apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's plenty of software available out of the box for Ubuntu (and all the derivatives), some developers only provide .deb downloads from their websites - that's where <a href="https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get" target="_blank">deb-get</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The idea is that it sources various extra applications for you, giving apt-get like functionality for 3rd party repositories or via direct download. Sounds pretty neat! A nice time-saving tool developed by Martin Wimpress, lead on Ubuntu MATE. It could help when you're getting setup initially, or just looking for something that isn't available from Ubuntu directly or Ubuntu perhaps has an older version than what you want to install.</p>
<p>Wimpress said the idea is directly inspired by Software Boutique, a tool used on Ubuntu MATE that does very much the same thing with a curated selection.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of software already supported so go give it a whirl and see what you think.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Free and popular precision-platformer &#39;Janosik&#39; gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some retro action-platformer to fill your time? Janosik quite a popular one, likely because it's free, and it just got a big upgrade.</p>
<p>"Janosik's companions were captured by the evil Count Von Zur and it’s up to you to find and rescue them from the prison. Explore hand-drawn pixel art world, find secrets, jump over deadly obstacles, roll and attack enemies, collect gold coins and find upgrades. Janosik gives you about 2 hours of single-player retro platforming fun."</p>
<p>The developer is currently working on a full sequel, and they decided to come back and improve the original. It moves to the latest Construct game engine along with adding in a map, travel corridors to connect up parts of the game, a new NPC that sells sword upgrades, lots of levels were re-designed, various new enemies, lava, new levels, new boss mechanics and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13201555191651678174gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13201555191651678174gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a rather great upgrade for a free game.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming overlay MangoHud has a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> is something that Valve use on the Steam Deck, specifically for the performance HUD that shows various details like FPS, frame timing, temperatures and more. It just had a new release with plenty of changes.</p>
<p>It's not only for the Steam Deck of course, as it works just fine on Linux desktops and was available long before the Deck was a thing. MangoHud version 0.6.7 has these main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show highest cpu freq instead of the cumulative average</li>
<li>Using sysfs scaling_cur_freq instead of /proc/cpuinfo for cpu core frequencies</li>
<li>Added EADesktop.exe and EALauncher.exe to blacklist</li>
<li>Logger writes a summary by default</li>
<li>Using gpu_metrics sysfs binary for amdgpu metrics</li>
<li>Showing min and max frametime for the period</li>
<li>Battery param shows a plug icon when plugged in</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to the items added to a blacklist, this is done for applications where it's not required and because it can stop certain games loading properly when used on their launchers and other loaders. Nice to see the plug icon made its way into a main release too, since that was already in the build used by the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A few fixes came along like fixing Splitgate crashing on AMD GPUs, fixed it not reporting AMD CPU power when using the zenpower module, fixed a regression in the hardware info updater and a bug was solved where setting CPU cores to offline would crash mangohud/mangoapp.</p>
<p>Some new Parameters have also been added which are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_only</code> - Allows you to only display FPS (requires legacy_layout=0)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery</code> - Shows battery and connection status for supported gamepads</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery_icon</code> - Replaces the percent amount with a battery icon</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">frame_count</code> - Shows the number of frames since start</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">throttling_status</code> - Shows if GPU is throttling based on Power, current, temp or "other" (Only shows if throttling is currently happening)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>HoloISO brings Valve&#39;s SteamOS 3 from the Steam Deck to everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has yet to actually release a proper iso for SteamOS 3 used on the Steam Deck, others have been taking it into their own hands to provide, like with the new <a href="https://github.com/bhaiest/holoiso" target="_blank">HoloISO</a>.</p>
<p>This is possible, since 99% of what SteamOS uses is open source (not the Steam client though) and so people can easily hack away at it to do whatever they want. It's not <em>exactly</em> the same as SteamOS 3 but it's probably the <em>closest</em> I've seen yet, with the main packages coming direct from Valve with "zero possible edits" the developer says.</p>
<p>HoloISO works with quite a lot already including the first-boot experience for the Steam Deck, the main Deck UI, the KDE Plasma Desktop Mode (including Valve's Vapor theme), Global FSR, frame limiting and more. Some issues exist though, like it not really working on NVIDIA GPUs and Intel needs some package downgrades. For AMD though, it's looking golden.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2656044751651657913gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2656044751651657913gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10415617941651657911gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10415617941651657911gol1.png"/></a><em>Pictures credit - the HoloISO team.</em></p>
<p>Still wouldn't exactly recommend it for full desktop use, best to really wait until Valve release it properly or at least leave it until HoloISO has had time to mature more.</p>

      <title>Media center and entertainment hub Kodi adds Steam Deck controls support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://kodi.tv/" target="_blank">Kodi</a> (originally XBMC), is a free and open source media center and entertainment hub, and the latest release up on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/tv.kodi.Kodi" target="_blank">Flathub</a> adds in support for the Steam Deck controller.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is a portable you might want to bring your various media with you from Music to Movies — it supports a huge amount. Also manage Photos, Games, TV Shows and more. The plugin system is great too, there's lots you can add into it. The idea is to give you a good looking way to manage and view it all.</p>
<p>Giving it a short test today, it seems to work just fine in Desktop Mode as it does in Gaming Mode when you add it to Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16050968721651656570gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16050968721651656570gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To install it on a Steam Deck, simply load up Discover and search for it. Nice and simple. You can see various guides on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube</a>.</p>

      <title>Star Labs add an AMD Ryzen option to the StarBook Mk V</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a fancy new laptop with great Linux support? Check out the <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/starbook" target="_blank">StarBook Mk V</a>, which just added an AMD Ryzen option.</p>
<p>Originally revealed in 2021, it's quite a tidy little unit the starts at £778, although as neither the Intel or AMD models are available until later this month (Intel) and late June (AMD) you get a 5% discount if you order now. The AMD model is also only available with either English (US) or English (UK) keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>So now you get a choice between Intel Core i3-1115G4, Intel® Core® i7-1165G7 or an AMD Ryzen™ 7 5800U 1.90GHz with all models configurable from 8GB RAM up to 64GB 3200MHz. Storage options are different though, while all can have an SSD from 240GB to 1920GB, the Intel models have the extra ability to be configured with "Gen4" SSDs that the AMD model does not. Additionally, the Intel model has a Thunderbolt 4 port while the AMD model has USB-C 3.2 Gen2 port instead.</p>

<p>With the display you get a 14 inch LED-backlit matte covering with IPS at 1920 x 1080. For power, they claim "up to" 11 hours battery life. You get a 65-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery, with a 65w USB-C Power Adapter.</p>
<p>You can select between various operating systems too including Ubuntu, elementary OS, Kubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro and more. Windows is an option too but adds to the cost.</p>

      <title>PowerTools is a Steam Deck Plugin for power users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to tweak more on your Steam Deck? You need some PowerTools. A new plugin for the Steam Deck Plugin Loader.</p>
<p>I was hoping to see something like this come along, but fair warning on this — anything you use like PowerTools is at your own risk, so if you screw up your device Valve likely won't help you out. I say this, because there's quite a few advanced tricks it can do and for most normal users, it won't really be needed.</p>
<p>Anyway, some of what PowerTools includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable and Disable CPU threads</li>
<li>Enable &amp; Disable CPU boost</li>
<li>Set CPU frequency</li>
<li>Set GPU Power</li>
<li>Set Fan speed</li>
<li>Probably more I missed</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410040281651592662gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410040281651592662gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>How can someone create this? Pretty simple if you know a bit of programming and where to look, since the Steam Deck uses Linux (SteamOS) and so the majority of it is open source (apart from the Steam client).</p>
<p>One of the way I know some of this will be useful is for emulation especially. Some old games and systems can act a little funny with the immense (relatively speaking) power and core count compared with what old games are expecting. Just one small example.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/NGnius/PowerTools" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Beautiful looking puzzle-adventure Sonority releases May 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hanging Gardens Interactive and Application Systems Heidelberg have announced their lush looking puzzle adventure Sonority will release on May 25. That includes Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>They claim it's quite "innovative", and it was one of the winners in the "Best Prototype" at the German Computer Game Awards 2020. With a hand-designed world and areas filled with some pretty beautiful landscapes, it definitely pulls in your attention. From their email they mentioned how "players will discover an unusual puzzle mechanic in which obstacles must be moved by arranging sequences of sounds" and that the "mechanics slowly become more complex and surprise the player again and again with new variations on the theme".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efu8HLs9-fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9299f29b9f8246c83ace8423afe15890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efu8HLs9-fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interesting new puzzle mechanic based on melodies. (Simple note sequences develop into small melodies and then into complex pieces of music.)</li>
<li>A touching story about Esther and an old, oddball raccoon and his singing stone friends.</li>
<li>A lovingly designed, cohesive 3D game world with varied locations.</li>
<li>Atmospheric, extensive soundtrack with English and German versions of original songs.</li>
<li>Play with keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The publisher sent along a review key, so hopefully I'll be taking a look.</em></p>

      <title>Peglin turns Peggle into a Slay the Spire styled roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It may be a little rough around the edges since it's brand new and in Early Access but Peglin might be another game I end up sinking 100s of hours into.</p>
<p>Peglin is basically what you get if you combine Peggle, where you shoot something to bounce it into little orbs, with the dungeon crawling and events style popularised by Slay the Spire. Released into Early Access in late April, it's working great on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>The idea is that you battle varies enemies, by loading up a little cannon below and firing it into all the tiles and pegs. Each representing another damage point, and how much you do depends on not just how many you hit, but what you're shooting and if you manage to land a hit on a bomb peg, or a critical hit peg and things like that. What you get is another game that's gloriously simple, easy to pick up and play but it will sucker you right in. Gives off that constant feeling of needing just one more run.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hoSRP-w-5K0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c1742d6164e367849c0fd40faefc4e62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hoSRP-w-5K0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: the developer has no plans right now for Native Linux support, citing some major <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1296610/discussions/0/3042732979949928058/#c3276941086757382921" target="_blank">problems</a> while Proton works pretty much perfectly. Seems they had it mostly working on Ubuntu, but Steam Deck gave them big headaches.</em></p>
<p>Apart from a few gamepad issues, which seem to be present on Windows too, it's a great experience.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collect and upgrade powerful orbs and relics</strong> to defeat the monsters and bosses that stand in your way.</li>
<li><strong>Fight enemies with Pachinko-like gameplay</strong> - hit more pegs to do more damage. Use crit potions, refresh potions, and bombs wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a new forest every time</strong>, with different orbs, enemies, and surprises along the way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During Early Access they plan to add in more content including meta-progression, customised runs, a difficulty ladder to progress through and much more. As it is right now, it's good but once you've played a few hours you see the current limitations but it has an absolutely brilliant foundation to keep building on. I can only imagine the crazy combinations they're going to add it.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296610/Peglin/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Lovecraft&#39;s Untold Stories 2 releases with Linux support on May 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 is an action RPG with rogue-like elements, a sequel to the hit from 2019 and it releases on May 17, 2022. While the first one is not supported on Linux, it should work nicely with Proton or Wine and it doesn't actually require you to know the first game the developer said. The publisher mentioned very clearly in their email today that Linux, macOS and Windows are supported for this one.</p>
<p>"Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 continues the narrative of the cult classic first game, but this time players will continue the fight against the unknown with new elements like crafting - using blueprints and resources to create consumables and even new equipment. Reunite with old acquaintances and meet new characters, explore new procedurally generated locations, defend yourself against dozens of different enemies and face off against epic bosses. But beware… Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 is more challenging than ever before, and the tough nightmarish creatures opposing you will not give up easily!"</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight dozens of different enemies, monsters and terrifying bosses from the Cthulhu Mythos</strong> in this intense, challenging action RPG. Ferocious beasts in the Swamps, Asylum lunatics, City thugs and the demonic creatures from the void will test your resolve to uncover the truth!</li>
<li><strong>Meet the 6 playable characters</strong> <strong>-</strong> 3 familiar faces from the series and 3 complete newcomers - each with their own weapons, gear and skills. Switch between them freely and pick the one most suited for the task at hand!</li>
<li><strong>Collect hundreds of different weapons and clothing items, or craft your own -</strong> scour every last room in a level, open every single box and get rewarded with randomized drops of gear, money for trading or resources and blueprints for crafting.</li>
<li><strong>Side quests are crucial -</strong> you can earn extra resources and items and get that extra bit of advantage you may need to be able to progress in the main story. Don’t forget to trigger side quests every time you encounter them, you don’t have to finish them right away, but keep them for when you need extra loot!</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the roguelike elements -</strong> level maps are randomly generated, as are all loot drops. The game is not pure roguelike: if you die or choose to restart the level, you only lose progress in the current area. Use this to your advantage, and if you don’t get the loot you wanted; try again!</li>
<li><strong>Make use of Charms and Amulets!</strong> Sacred relics which grant strange new abilities. Find those that serve you the best and make your journey unique - but beware, power may come at a cost!</li>
<li><strong>Plunge into the world of darkness where every step could be your last</strong>. Balance on the brink of madness as you explore the Asylum and various other locales in the city of Arkham, Swamps, Enchanted Forest, even the Underworld and many more mind-bending locations, all in procedurally generated levels!</li>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles gets a UI refresh, developers now GNOME Foundation Members</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of news and excitement happening for <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the free and open source application designed to help you manage various programs and games on Linux that need Wine.</p>
<p>First, quite a fun one, the developers of Bottles are now part of the <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/" target="_blank">GNOME Foundation</a>. What does that mean exactly? Well "Members can run for election to the Board of Directors, vote in the elections for the Board of Directors, and suggest referenda. The membership process is overseen by the Membership and Elections Committee" (<a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Bottles is also going through the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Circle/-/issues/61" target="_blank">approvals</a> process to become a <a href="https://circle.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME Circles</a> app, which is pretty much a way of saying it's not a direct GNOME app but has their blessing and gives Bottles a few extra benefits like developer support, advertising and so on.</p>
<p>During the Linux App Summit 2022, two of the developers also did a presentation on Bottles:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HxM15UOVmyA?rel=0&amp;start=9353"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7034da4bc88d5e59f6cd0f6ec0bdae13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HxM15UOVmyA?rel=0&amp;start=9353" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Two updates (<a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.5.2/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.4.28/" target="_blank">#2</a>) were also just released, with a lot of the latest release largely cleaning up the UI to conform to what is needed to be accepted into GNOME Circle. Plenty of it is just being more consistent, adjusting a few parts to be more clear to users with an improved startup / new user experience and more explanations of what to do.</p>
<p>Other features that were added / improved include: custom paths for storing Bottles, updates to the template system, performance improvements, a new Journal system to read through logs and plenty of bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Space Invaders fused with awesome music, Beat Invaders gets a huge 2.0 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite possibly one of my absolute favourite games released in 2022, Beat Invaders is a marvellous fusion of the classic Space Invaders with slick beats and neon lighting. Version 2.0 is out now adding in a lot and overhauling even more.</p>
<p>"Beat Invaders is a space-themed action roguelite shoot-em-up with a musical twist! A convoy of space freighters needs to ship their cargo - the hottest music tracks in town - to the beat-hungry interstellar clubs scattered across the galaxy.  However, their path is blocked by swarms of music-hating hordes!  Protect those freighters and their precious cargo at all costs, and help the universe to dance the night away once more!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16628830311651574580gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16628830311651574580gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in version 2.0 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 new music tracks</li>
<li>Waves 1-40 are now split into sectors with unique themes</li>
<li>Daily and Weekly Challenges</li>
<li>A new boss battle</li>
<li>More ship customization</li>
<li>Better performance with even more projectiles</li>
<li>Around 25 new upgrades, and a rework of existing upgrades</li>
<li>Enemies gain more health over the course of a run.</li>
<li>New Event Wave: Minefield</li>
<li>New Enemy Type: Spreader Mine</li>
<li>Steam Rich Presence was added.</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It should be illegal for such an awesome game to go so widely unnoticed. Simple brilliance.</em></p>
<p>Make sure you go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863080/Beat_Invaders/" target="_blank">buy a copy from Steam</a>. Also, it's now Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator hits 1 million sales, adds voice chat and new map</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator has been a huge success now for Pine Studio, with 1 million sales in around 7 months and a fresh major update is out now.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've added a new official puzzle room that pays tribute to their earlier game called Cats in Time. In this new room you will need to repair a time machine. They say to prepare for some "strange issues" that may happen and the clock is ticking, you only have thirty minutes to solve it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dze1DmQFDg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d66d5868c9074e758e44dee3983fa23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dze1DmQFDg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also added in Voice Chat, which thankfully does not use Vivox since they still don't support Linux. Instead, the developer went with Steam Voice so there should be no problems with cross-platform voice here.</p>
<p>More upgrades were done too with texture compression in custom rooms, with users able to adjust it and the main menu should use less RAM. On top of that, the Room Editor had plenty of updates and tweaks too like multi-selection for everything, more tooltips, better collisions, UI tweaks and more.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing to improve the typing experience with the Steam Deck on-screen keyboard, Valve has released a new Steam Deck Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216143124019700248" target="_blank">update</a> with additions. This comes shortly after adding in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-lock-screen-window-switcher-and-more/" target="_blank">support for other languages</a> too.</p>
<p>There's now the option to use English Dvorak and Colemak keyboard layouts, if you prefer them. To change them, go into the Settings menu (press the Steam button) and then down to Keyboard and tap where it says Edit next to Active Keyboards.</p>
<p>Here's how they look:</p>

<p>Additionally a miscellaneous crash was fixed that snuck its way into the previous update.</p>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam hits second highest percentage in years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have put out their usual monthly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=combined" target="_blank">Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> and it's looking pretty great for Linux overall. April 2022 showed a big boost to Linux gamers. After a few months of dipping down, it seems to have rocketed back up to be at the second-highest point it's been in years with 1.14%.</p>
<p>You can see how it has changed over the last few years on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, with the current posted below. The previous peak being November 2021 at 1.16%, the previous second highest being October 2021 at 1.13%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12538162671651568072gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12538162671651568072gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Going by the main combined numbers from Steam, these are the current most popular Linux distributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 0.16% +0.03%</li>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 0.14% +0.02%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 0.13% +0.01%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 0.07% 0.00%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 21.10 64 bit 0.06% -0.01%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Steam Deck now shipping that uses SteamOS 3 Linux, it's perhaps not a big surprise to see a lot more interest in Linux Gaming overall now. Currently though, the Steam Survey is not included on the Steam Deck in Gaming Mode and only in Desktop Mode with the main Steam Client loaded so these numbers probably don't represent many Steam Deck users at all.</p>
<p>Thanks though to Proton and the Steam Deck, perhaps this is the start of a small shift over to Linux — one can hope but too early to tell anything really.</p>

      <title>Going Rogue: A Festival of Persistence event is live on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/going_rogue" target="_blank">Going Rogue: A Festival of Persistence</a> is a new week-long event on Steam, celebrating how diverse and confusing the whole roguelike thing is.</p>
<p>This includes Roguelikes, Roguelites, and everything in between — so technically it covers a huge amount of games as many like to claim they're some form of roguelike. Valve even jokingly said in their press email how there's "no need to argue this on the internet with strangers" as they outline it all in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3175610095143798950" target="_blank">blog post</a>. It's interesting enough, and does highlight the problems with defining game genres properly, with different interpretations and how they should be used.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3POUi1Imy0k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/102ed2eb8e01bfd81f3e4a0ed71c8b6a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3POUi1Imy0k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm liking this more natural feeling I get from Valve, they seem way more playful over the last couple of years, as you can see in the video above.</p>
<p>Valve also teamed up with a few content creators for a rather long video on it all:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YbsM8JtRKHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57d35155b7055011a6a4b6e6a488b183.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YbsM8JtRKHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The event runs until May 9.</p>
<p>If you discover a really good deal, be sure to let us know in the comments why you think people should buy it.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group to acquire Eidos, Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix Montréal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another huge acquisition for the games industry today as Embracer Group <a href="https://embracer.com/release/embracer-group-enters-into-an-agreement-to-acquire-eidos-crystal-dynamics-and-square-enix-montreal-amongst-other-assets/" target="_blank">have agreed</a> to purchase Eidos, Crystal Dynamics, and Square Enix Montréal amongst others.</p>
<p>This is honestly massive it means they now control the likes of Tomb Raider, Thief, Deus Ex, Legacy of Kain and "more than 50 back-catalogue games" from Square Enix. With this deal they add another ~1,000 employees to their list around the world for 300 million USD.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all pending the usual approvals process from regulators. It's not quite a done deal but it will likely go through just fine like their previous acquisitions have.</p>
<p>Embracer Group are truly huge now controlling and owning various publishers and developers directly including the likes of Coffee Stain, Gearbox, Ghost Ship Games, Deep Silver, Flying Wild Hog, Warhorse Studios, Koch Media, Asmodee, Saber Interactive, Aspyr Media, THQ Nordic and the list just keeps on going.</p>
<p>From the Press Release:</p>

      <title>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed gets a huge character overhaul and lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed came to Linux recently as a Native title and it is Steam Deck Verified but it wasn't without issues, which Digital Cybercherries have now fixed up. The latest update isn't just bug fixing though, it also overhauls and adds in quite a lot of the game too.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes a Character Packaging system, so like a real toy each character has their own package which you can also customize. There's new and unique action sounds for each character, unique voice acting for each character, an improved invite system for online play, platform specific player icons, cross-platform saves and lots of other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eZSklqh9YXs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/664a6c69d4fca48db7467f2238e049cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eZSklqh9YXs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Linux players, the invite code system didn't actually work as you couldn't paste the code. I let them know, and it should be fixed in this release.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy a copy from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Relaxing and gorgeous city-builder Dorfromantik is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dorfromantik is a masterful blending of genres to create something you don't often see. Bringing together elements of tile matching with a city-builder, it sure is a peaceful way to game. <u>Note</u>: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>Played on Linux with Proton (and it works well on the Steam Deck too), this might actually be my new favourite way to unwind. No issues discovered at all, a true out of the box experience on Linux. Developed by Toukana Interactive, it has similar basic mechanics to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/colourful-city-builder-islanders-has-officially-released-for-linux-and-its-really-lovely/" target="_blank">Islanders</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/home-wind-is-a-free-minimalist-relaxing-and-cozy-city-builder/" target="_blank">Home Wind</a> with you matching up new buildings or areas (tiles) to keep on expanding, and build up a score to unlock more types of tiles. This is probably my favourite so far though by miles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aHzaY6TLKik"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/794ac2f31a834587652613ea414d18cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aHzaY6TLKik" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In fairness, Dorfromantik while having some similar basics to the aforementioned games, does it quite differently overall. You're building the world as you go, with each tile you place down near the border giving you more area to place down tiles and it just keeps on going. It offers three things I love: the endless replay value and (in the nicest possible meaning) mindless clicking that looks good. Then, you also have the strategy element to it (if you want it), to keep beating the high score with careful tile placement.</p>
<p>Some tiles give you little mini-quests like having more matching tiles linked up, doing so will give you even more to continue that never-ending expansion. Once you really get going you end up discovering new biomes, and there's also some special pre-place tile objects that can give you tasks to complete over a longer period allowing you to unlock even more of the game to continue, once again, that never-ending expansion.</p>
<p>When you place down tiles and they link up it's wonderful, seeing how they can all blend together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3501714451651489184gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3501714451651489184gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You won't find any traditional strategy elements here. There's no territory issues, no combat, no resource building or anyone that — just peaceful tile placing. Absolutely wonderful. This is practically as close to perfection as a game can get and not something I ever say lightly and extremely rare for me to come close to saying.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1455840/Dorfromantik/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Also on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dorfromantik" target="_blank">GOG</a> if you want to try with Wine.</p>

      <title>Society management city-builder Kapital: Sparks of Revolution is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kapital: Sparks of Revolution is a city-builder that brings in some social society management, so prepare for some fierce class riots and more. Quite an interesting turn for a city-builder, since most tend to focus on pure economy simulation.</p>
<p>This is a little more, dare I say it, human. The idea is that you're given limited resources and you need to balance the needs of the people and city development. So you'll deal with angry crowds, money, resources and try to create a society that actually works and most likely fail at some point.</p>
<p>"Being a mayor in Kapital: Sparks of Revolution is a delicate balancing act. Each decision has different consequences for the various classes inhabiting the city. Important investments need to be made into resource distribution, housing and security if tensions spill into the streets. When one class becomes disgruntled, things may get ugly if their concerns are not swiftly addressed."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6IMHxhaJnrM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1610df8e87faa60538c55f853834f80e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6IMHxhaJnrM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release, it hasn't managed to get the best of reviews with it being Mixed overall from users on Steam as it seems there's a number of issues currently. The developer put up an announcement that they will "continue to improve the game based on your feedback" and they were "surprised with the amount of constructive feedback". Going further, they said to expect "new features never seen before in city builders to make the game a truly unique crisis management game".</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/kapital-sparks-of-revolution?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1399700/Kapital_Sparks_of_Revolution/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Once again <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/kapital_sparks_of_revolution" target="_blank">GOG</a> only has a Windows build.</p>

      <title>The Long Dark has some huge changes on the way with paid survival DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hinterland has confirmed now that the future of the The Long Dark will have the Story and Survival modes completely separate, along with paid expansions for the Survival mode. This news shouldn't be a shock to regular players, or our readers, since we covered their initial thoughts on it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/the-long-dark-gets-another-big-upgrade-to-the-survival-mode/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a> where they announced the plans.</p>
<p>Now things are more set in stone, as detailed in a new <a href="https://hinterlandforums.com/forums/topic/41847-april-developer-diary/" target="_blank">developer diary</a>.</p>
<p>The game will be split in two, and all existing owners on all platforms will have full access to what they had already. So no one will actually be losing out on anything. Right now, they're already at a point where Survival mode will run standalone, so they can update it independently. Soon they will have the Story mode doing the same. Part of the point is that, they say, it streamlines the process and makes it easier to update both, while having Survival updates not impact the story with the opposite also being true.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7417152341651485005gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7417152341651485005gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So what we will see in future is a separate release, with Survival getting a series of paid DLC expansions. These will take the form of a sort-of season pass to get everything, and then going out as DLC once the season is finished for anyone who prefers to buy it that way. Free updates will also continue but be smaller.</p>
<p>It does sound reasonable, especially considering how many years they've continued to provide big free upgrades for everyone.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's going to be a Leadership change. Raphael van Lierop will be standing down, with studio veteran Katie Sorrell taking over. Lierop will still be the overall creative head at Hinterland though, and has written the final part of story too.</p>
<p>You can buy The Long Dark from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-long-dark?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/305620/The_Long_Dark/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Looks like developer Crows Crows Crows has managed to make a hit into another hit, with The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe shifting 100,000 copies in the first 24 hours the developer announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/crowsx3/status/1519712683850977285" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>"When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers. You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you."</p>

<p>I went through some of the new content live on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Twitch channel</a>, until my PC had something of an unrelated mini-meltdown. Until that point though, it was <em>great</em>. The new content is thankfully easy to get to, and it doesn't exactly let you miss it with big signs pointing where to go (that alone is pretty funny). The narrator continues being brilliant, and some of it really had me properly belly-laughing.</p>
<p>Won't spoil anything here, as this kind of game really needs you to go in blind for the majority of it. Safe to say I can highly recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1703340/The_Stanley_Parable_Ultra_Deluxe/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Microsoft joined the Open 3D Foundation for the Open 3D Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a missed one from Friday, Microsoft has joined the Open 3D Foundation, who oversee the Open 3D Engine that's a free and open source updated version of Amazon Lumberyard that was contributed by Amazon. Only caught this as they boosted their post on <a href="https://twitter.com/o3dengine/status/1520908609462448128" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. It seems no press email was sent out to us when it happened.</p>
<p>It's another big boon for the up and coming game engine designed to help build anything from AAA games to cinema-quality 3D worlds, as the more companies that back it the better. Microsoft has joined as a "Premier" member, although I can't seem to find a <em>proper</em> explanation as to what the difference between member states are. Usually, it's a big difference in the funding they provide. I've asked the Open 3D Foundation to clarify that.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-open-3d-foundation-welcomes-microsoft-as-a-premier-member-to-advance-the-future-of-open-source-3d-development-301536018.html" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>"Microsoft's roots in creativity run deep and we want to help creators wherever they are, whoever they are, and whatever platform they're creating for," said Oliver. "Having the Linux Foundation create the Open 3D Foundation is a fantastic step towards helping more creators everywhere and we are excited to be a part of it."</p>
<p>"We are elated to have Microsoft join the Open 3D Foundation as a Premier member," said Royal O'Brien, Executive Director of O3DF and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. "Having incredible industry veterans like Microsoft contributing and helping drive innovation with the community for 3D engines is a huge benefit to the open source community and the companies that use it alike."</p>

      <title>Crawl through dungeons, hack computers, or explore an undersea base: Dungeon Crawler Jam</title>
      <author>Dennis_Payne</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Before computers had the hardware for 3D games, some games still managed a 3D view on a limited scale in dungeon crawlers. The 3D views were created with prerendered walls and ground that were composed together. Due to this you were restricted to 90 degree turns and movement was restricted to squares on a grid. The game might draw a few in between frames when walking forward but those were already rendered and you couldn't stop halfway between these squares.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://dungeoncrawlers.org/" target="_blank">dungeoncrawlers.org</a> organized the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2021. They returned again this year and over forty games were submitted. Some are very much in the vein of classic dungeon crawlers, while others have modern elements. I have not played through them all but have picked some the entries that I've tried and recommend. Games <em>without</em> Linux versions were run on the latest Wine version available on Fedora. There may be some small spoilers in the descriptions but I've tried to keep that to a minimum.</p>
<p><a href="https://hephforgegaming.itch.io/cycle-of-spore" target="_blank">Cycle of Spore</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13804114221651325387gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13804114221651325387gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>An explosion knocked you unconscious while on a school trip to a garden maze. The explosion has spread seedlings everywhere. Most of your classmates are probably infected but you focus on trying to find your friends.</p>
<p>The purple and cyan colors of the environment and monsters contribute to the horror setting. Your health is represented with leaves on a vine which fits the setting. Sometimes the monster graphics didn't appear but otherwise I didn't have any problems playing the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://hiimwren.itch.io/xenoseekers" target="_blank">Xenoseekers</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614822611651325390gol10189.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614822611651325390gol10189.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An alien spacecraft broke apart in low orbit and rained debris and toxic substances down on the earth. Humanity used the alien technology to construct domed cities but cannot repair the machines. You are a relic seeker travelling the wasteland for alien technology to keep the domed cities functioning.</p>
<p>You start in the safety of your vehicle. You can purchase equipment and save before descending into a dungeon. The toxic air requires you to bring your own oxygen which limits the time you have to explore. Beware of the mutant creatures inhabiting the dungeons. After collecting as much as you feel is safe, you can drive to a new dungeon to explore.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamknight.itch.io/aegir-rising" target="_blank">Aegir Rising</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6309494521651325383gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6309494521651325383gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>You awake with no memory but a voice over a speaker helps you out. You appear to be on an underwater base after an experiment on the base has gone horribly wrong.</p>
<p>The game feels similar to the game Soma but has it's own story. The enemies appear as cardboard cut-outs which gives the game a unique look. It is a little dark on my display but is playable.</p>
<p><a href="https://zooperdan.itch.io/it-came-from-the-forest" target="_blank">It Came from the Forest</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2415024711651325388gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2415024711651325388gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>An unknown darkness has fallen on the area. All people know is that it came from the forest.</p>
<p>This game follows a more classic dungeon crawler design with a fantasy setting. The game includes a short tutorial area to explain some mechanics found in older games like illusionary walls and teleporters. Combats are real time with only a few options. There is no Linux version but the game uses Love2D and includes the source code. Instead of using Wine, I was able to run it with the native Love2D on Fedora.</p>
<p><a href="https://entikan.itch.io/hz-so-good" target="_blank">Hz So Good</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10863169311651325388gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10863169311651325388gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>After hacking into a computer system, you need to avoid or defeat the security systems to find data to sell.</p>
<p>The game has psychedelic visual style that works for the setting. In addition to integrity which serves as your health you have storage space. You need to upgrade your storage to get larger data files. You purchase warez to fool the systems to give you greater access and add offensive capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://inkusgames.itch.io/dumbest-dungeon" target="_blank">Dumbest Dungeon</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2635670031651325388gol10189.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2635670031651325388gol10189.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Dumbest Dungeon is a parody fantasy setting where you explore dungeons and battle using cards. The card battle system is fun with humorous card abilities. The visual style is great for the tone of the game. Remember to pet Mr Mittens before entering the dungeon.</p>
<p><a href="https://mkimball.itch.io/gift-of-fire" target="_blank">Gift of Fire</a></p>
<p>War has raged between the surface animals and the Underground Kingdom. After the Rat King stole the Gift of Fire, the surface has been growing colder. The Underground Kingdom has flourished but one soldier has seen enough death from the conflict and tries to return the Gift of Fire.</p>
<p>While many game jam entries are solo efforts, a team of eight put together Gift of Fire. The team has put in an amazing amount of work in graphics, gameplay and level design. The combat system displays a pattern of "abc" which you need to quickly memorize and enter before the time runs out. As the game progresses the patterns get longer. It didn't seem that interesting but it proved more fun than I expected. The level have a collection of keys and switches to discover.</p>
<p><a href="https://narkhos.itch.io/digging-dungeon" target="_blank">Digging Dungeon</a></p>
<p>No story is provided for this entry. You are simply tasked with collecting twenty five emeralds. The real time combat system is well done but the high random encounter rate mars the experience. The developer plans to fix the enemy spawn rate after the game jam's rating period is over. If you persevere, you encounter the digging mechanic and a second enemy type. It makes me curious what more could be done with this design.</p>
<p><a href="https://danga.itch.io/labyrinth" target="_blank">Labyrinth</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5796604051651325389gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5796604051651325389gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>"Labyrinth is a short mind bending dungeon puzzler, where you must crawl on every surface to find your way out."</p>
<p>The description from the game page gives the best explanation of this game. You walk up walls to pass barriers which makes it a very different dungeon crawler.</p>
<p><a href="https://fernandolv3.itch.io/arcadeus" target="_blank">The Tomb of the King Arcadeus</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17233543981651325390gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17233543981651325390gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>You have discovered the Tomb of the King Arcadeus but there are multiple challenges before you reach the king's final resting place.</p>
<p>This one doesn't really feel like a dungeon crawler to me but I'm not the gatekeeper to dungeon crawlers. In this game you play a series of minigames as you explore the dungeon. The minigames are well done and give a different experience from any of the other games mentioned here.</p>
<p>The Game Jam and all submissions be found on <a href="https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2022" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck updates out for Stable and Beta, better Refresh Rate Switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another set of Steam Deck upgrades and it includes updates for both the Stable and Beta branches.</p>
<p>For the Stable update, there's a few fixes and some new additions. Here's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3216143124007678705" target="_blank">what's new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added pinned notifications to the Quick Access Menu for friend requests and comments</li>
<li>Added two new notifications: Steam gift received and Item received</li>
<li>Added "View Mutual Friends" to invites page</li>
<li>Minor updates to localized keyboard themes</li>
<li>Fixed issue where controller input goes to the remote computer while the on-screen keyboard is up during Remote Play</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the left trackpad pressure could be unresponsive in the Deck UI after launching a game</li>
<li>Fixed issue where games with no action sets crashing on launch</li>
<li>Fixed a case where a game library would appear as locked if the lender is in Offline mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that, the Beta update was improved to "cause less black screen time when changing refresh rate". Currently, when you swap the refresh rate the screen will momentarily turn black so they're working to reduce that happening. Their previous <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/" target="_blank">Beta post</a> was updated to note it.</p>
<p>Additionally, open source consulting firm Collabora recently <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/pipewire-bluetooth-support-status-update.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Steam Deck has become a conformant Bluetooth A2DP audio product thanks to the work done in PipeWire and WirePlumber.</p>

      <title>Canonical going &#39;all in&#39; on gaming for Ubuntu, new Steam Snap package in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's a huge focus on Flatpak and Flathub thanks to the Steam Deck shipping with it out of the box, Canonical on the other hand continue with their own Snap packaging and they have a Steam Snap in testing for Ubuntu (and other distros, since Snap also works elsewhere).</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/introducing-early-access-to-the-steam-snap/28082" target="_blank">introduction post</a> on the Ubuntu Linux Discourse forum (thanks <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/04/steam-snap-store" target="_blank">OMGUbuntu</a>), it outlines how they're now actually "going all in on the gaming experience on Ubuntu and we’ve started building out a team dedicated to working on just that". Part of that is reducing the need for PPAs and other solutions, and their focus now is on Steam.</p>
<p>The call for testing has now begun on their Steam Snap package which gives you everything you need for Native Linux gaming and for Proton too. It's early days for the Steam Snap so expect issues but they said they will "iterate quickly, and respond to this feedback" on it.</p>
<p>On top of that we can expect more gaming on Ubuntu Linux improvements to come "such as providing easy ways to get more bleeding edge components like Mesa drivers, and even newer kernels and proprietary drivers" — that all sounds great to me.</p>
<p>It's not actually live yet but once it will be, I'll update the post here with instructions they give, which they will also post in the link above. <strong>Update</strong>: Canonical has now done an additional <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/level-up-linux-gaming-new-steam-snap" target="_blank">blog post</a>, going over the instructions. Either install it from the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/steam" target="_blank">website / Snap Store</a> or via terminal: <code class="inline-code">snap install steam --beta</code></p>
<p>With the blog post, Canonical once again reiterated their plan to improve Ubuntu gaming mentioning that "the Ubuntu Desktop team is getting down to work planning for the future, and improving the gaming experience features heavily in our priorities (and hiring plan!)". They go on to mention how "serious gamers" continue using Windows primarily, which we all know as Steam puts Linux at about 1% currently (see our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>) but they hope by "improving the gaming experience, and the Steam experience in particular, we can ensure that Ubuntu can become a genuine daily driver for gamers".</p>

      <title>Good Old Games Week is live on GOG with a sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good Old Games, what GOG were originally known as, is a bit more than just a name it's a commitment to keeping classics alive and easy to purchase so GOG are celebrating with a sale.</p>
<p>Of course, plenty of the games in their classics collection don't have Native Linux versions because a lot of them are incredibly old. That's fine though really, considering how good the likes of DOSBox, ScummVM and Wine are — most will likely just work out of the box with one of those ready.</p>
<p>It's not just a sale though as GOG has put up some more titles like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/revolt" target="_blank">Re-Volt</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/deadly_dozen_reloaded" target="_blank">Deadly Dozen Reloaded</a> and various titles from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?publishers=throwback-entertainment" target="_blank">Throwback Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>Along with this, GOG has made a special <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/good-old-games" target="_blank">dedicated page just for Good Old Games</a>.</p>
<p>During the event, GOG said to expect more, so we might see other classics appear.</p>
<p>The aptly named Good Old Games Week runs from April 29 - May 9.</p>

      <title>First-person zombie co-op shooter Projekt Z is up on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Projekt Z from German studio 314 Arts is now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/314artsohg/projekt-z-ww2-zombie-coop-fps" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with an ambitious plan to release a free to play shooter that's supported on Linux.</p>
<p>A game that I've followed for quite some time, as their early development blog videos were pretty impressive and they definitely left the impression of knowing what they're doing. It will be interesting to see how the crowdfunding goes, especially since they're asking for funds for what will be free to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21266572341651234791gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21266572341651234791gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Projekt Z is a free-to-play first-person coop shooter set in a WW2 Zombie scenario on a secret German island. The game focuses on the "Projekt Z", a project run by the Nazis to turn Zombies, which have been discovered on the island earlier, into weapons to turn the war around in Nazi Germany's favor. Choose a character that has an ability that favors your playstyle. Play through the coop story with your friends and take care of your hub. Find food, water, gas, and other resources to give the people in your hub a chance to survive. Find other survivors (NPCs) during the missions and shelter them. But be aware every decision you and your friends make will influence the morale inside the hub. Be a judge and decide what will happen to the people that do not follow the rules. Be a leader and prioritize the resources you find. Are you going to upgrade your weapons and characters, or do you help someone? It's all up to you and your friends. Projekt Z is not just a basic zombie coop game, it's a management game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their latest dev video below shows off some of the very early gameplay while they explain some of it:</p>

<p>Liking what I'm seeing, and the developer confirmed to me today their original plan for Native Linux support is still in place so that's great too.</p>

      <title>Mistlands in Valheim will have strange structures — and Hares</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As work continues on the major Mistlands update for Valheim, Iron Gate have given us another teaser of what's to come for their co-op survival game.</p>
<p>Firstly, a video they did earlier this month that I missed, is that Valheim will have Hares hopping around in the Mistlands. You can watch them model it below with a brief clip of it in-game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ddzQ_Bzn89s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e1f6135e77fe07abb77dfb398be5506.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ddzQ_Bzn89s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another creature is being teased, although they're not quite ready to talk about it yet. Iron Gate said "we think they’ll be something many of you have been curious about!" so what do you think that will be?</p>
<p>Exploring the Mistlands sounds like it will be quite a sight to see. Like other places, the Mistlands "were once a place where civilisations of old built homes and strongholds alike" and so you will end up seeing the remnants of these old inhabitants through various structures left laying around. These still might change before release but for now we have these teasers (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18398625501651231178gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18398625501651231178gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6686710511651231180gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6686710511651231180gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A patch to help stop players overwriting their saves with an older one from Steam Cloud is also in the works.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Easy GE-Proton installer ProtonUp-Qt now shows Steam Deck compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> is great. A very simple application that allows you to download extra compatibility layers for Linux desktops and the Steam Deck and now it's even better. This tool helps you install GE-Proton (formerly Proton-GE) and Luxtorpeda for Steam, plus it also helps with Wine-GE for the game managers Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>The latest release, ProtonUp-Qt v2.6.2, is out now adding in the display of official Proton in the game list, a new column to show expected Steam Deck compatibility in the game list and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how it looks:</p>

<p>You can find the source up on <a href="https://github.com/the3dfxdude/7kaa" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I looked around but couldn't find an easy way to play it on Linux that doesn't involve compiling it, perhaps someone helpful can get it up on <a href="https://flathub.org/home" target="_blank">Flathub</a> to help keep it nicely preserved.</p>

      <title>Owlboy gets a nice upgrade, should now work great on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Owlboy, a rather sweet story-driven platformer developed by D-Pad Studio has been updated and it's quite a major change for the tech behind it that will make it run nicely on the Steam Deck. Currently, the game has an "Unsupported" rating but this should hopefully move it over to Verified.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed to <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>, which should fix multiple crashes</li>
<li>The old XNA version of the game is still available on the "xnaversion" beta branch on Steam</li>
<li>Level loading is much faster</li>
<li>More readable Japanese, Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean fonts</li>
<li>Better error logging, moved logs to C:\Users\<user>\Saved Games\Owlboy\Saves\logs</user></li>
<li>One shared build for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
<li>Support for PS4 controller natively</li>
<li>Help files now available in Data/Help in the install directory</li>
<li>Many out of bounds and speed-runner glitches fixed</li>
</ul>

      <title>Kaiju Wars seems like Into the Breach but it&#39;s much more and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taken at face value, you could easily think that Kaiju Wars was close to Into the Breach but after playing it, I can safely tell you it's a whole lot more than that. While they both have you command armies on small maps against incoming enemies, Kaiju Wars has a bunch of extras that really do set the two games nicely apart.</p>
<p>In Kaiju Wars you're defending cities against huge creatures, and to do so you need to construct buildings and an army (and repair them when destroyed). The gameplay is a bit more flexible and forgiving that way compared with Into the Breach. Here you don't kill anything, you only really slow them down for them to come back and stomp all over your cities in later missions.</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r4YvQxqTDCs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0b4f9e891dbebf42e81635e0abce695.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r4YvQxqTDCs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The style and interface looks all a bit retro here, and while the graphical style in missions is actually quite awesome, I found the overall interface to be a bit lacking, and the way the main menu is set up to be a little too messy. A mostly minor nitpick there though. The way the creatures are designed is brilliant, you get a good sense of their scale and power in the missions compared with your tiny units.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a silly game too, with some slightly cringe-worthy comedy dialogue but it all fits so nicely with the theme here. It's set in the future, but your military advisor and the style feels like something out of an 80s action film in some ways. The campaign is set up like a comic book too with each panel being either a mission, a news story or something else. Their version of King Kong is called Big Donk, and if you complete the mission where you first encounter them, you're told some special anti-Kaiju serum was delivered via a giant banana, which is the only reason why it ran away. After that mission, I'll admit that seeing the ridiculous real-life styled news reporting about it made me laugh. All of the creatures (there's five) have these funny nicknames in the game, like another the Hell Turkey.</p>
<p>You play through a series of turns with Kaiju movement, your economy bringing in money and research from buildings you have left, and then you get to repair / build units and move them around. What did take a little while is getting to properly understand how to correctly use each unit. The point here is <em>not</em> to kill (since you're seriously out-gunned) but to slow down the Kaiju, and certain units are better at doing that — especially while being trampled on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18575795501651169036gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18575795501651169036gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4751922941651169038gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4751922941651169038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's all about getting the right positioning on where to leave your units and what side to attack from, and hoping the creatures go the way you've planned for. You get to see a few tiles of where they might move, and what percentage chance they will take that route so you're not totally blind. If you're wrong, you have to reposition, repair units at a base and keep moving around and attack to slow them down.</p>
<p>Kaiju Wars is pretty much a strategy game of playing cat and mouse with tanks, rockets and giant monsters wrapped up in a delightful bright retro visual style and comedy sprinkled throughout.</p>
<p>You play through a full story campaign but there's plenty more outside of that too. Kaiju Wars also has Twitch Integration, a local versus mode, a map editor and weekly challenges. It all certainly adds up and I can see myself repeatedly coming back to this for one more run. That said, it does make me value the beautiful simplicity of Into the Breach but for those after something with a little more flavour — Kaiju Wars has plenty of destruction to offer.</p>

      <title>Trigon: Space Story is a fresh FTL-like space strategy game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this looks pretty darn cool. Did you enjoy FTL: Faster Than Light? Well, Trigon: Space Story looks very much inspired by it but with much more modern graphics. Developed by Sernur.tech and published by Gameforge 4D GmbH, it doesn't just looked like FTL, they were directly inspired by it to create an FTL 2 that never came. Nice to see a title with full Linux support too, with a Native Linux build available.</p>
<p>Trigon: Space Story places you in the captain's seat of a fully customizable starship. Here you manage everything from the weapons systems and engines to the day-to-day tasks of the crew. Each time you play it's fresh, with a procedurally generated universe that has you travel through 9 different sectors with over 10 individual systems. With dangerous space anomalies, roving gangs of space pirates, and a complex web of intergalactic politics to navigate, you will need to strategize each approach with myriad factors to consider.</p>

<li>It’s a Culture Thing: On your travels, you will make first contact with multiple species, each with their own unique qualities, like the warmongering militant Rakhi, or the crafty and tenacious Earthlings.     </li>
<li>Decisions, Decisions: You find a damaged ship with a crew that needs rescuing. Do you take the noble route and save them? Or hit ‘em while they’re weak and take their stuff?     </li>

      <title>Bugsnax out on Steam, looking good on Steam Deck but tweak needed on Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bugsnax, originally a console exclusive for PlayStation and an Epic Exclusive on PC, was just released on Steam. Thankfully it works well on Steam Deck but on Linux desktops you need a small adjustment for the Windows version running through Proton.</p>
<p>By default, the game uses DirectX 11 which is a bit broken, for the Steam Deck the developer did a tweak to automatically change it over to DirectX 9 - so on Deck it works well out of the box. For Linux desktops though, you need to manually force it to DX9. There's two ways to do this either by editing the config file to change it over found here:</p>
<p><code>/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/674140/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Bugsnax/Settings/Config.xml</code></p>
<p>Inside here, you can edit this line to have a "4" instead of a "6": <code class="inline-code">int name="System_VideoDriver" value="6"</code></p>
<p><strong>Or</strong>, you can set this as a Steam launch option: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_NO_D3D11=1 PROTON_NO_D3D10=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Back earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/674140/discussions/0/3278066352367210687/#c3278066352367292925" target="_blank">noted</a> on Steam they will look into sorting that for Proton overall but it's not yet fixed so that is needed for now. Again though, that's not needed on Steam Deck but once done Bugsnax looks great on a Linux desktop too.</p>

      <title>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe from Crows Crows Crows is out now with Native Linux support and it's looking good. In no time at all, it gained an Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam so it seems this new expanded edition has been worth it for both the developer and players.</p>
<p>"When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers.</p>
<p>You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you."</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.2 Beta brings a new Steam Deck Fan Curve, experimental Refresh Rate Switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has only just put <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-lock-screen-window-switcher-and-more/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.1 into the Stable channel</a> with tons of improvements and there's already a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/" target="_blank">Beta available for SteamOS 3.2</a> with some big goodies.</p>
<p>The first is that Valve are trying to deal with all the noise complaints about the fan. As it turns out, there's multiple fans being used in the Steam Deck, and one of them gives this annoying high-pitch whine. Since I've had a <a href="https://youtu.be/hNg2a7rFT3M" target="_blank">replacement</a> recently, I've now seen first-hand just how annoying it is. The new OS-controlled fan curve should improve that making it near-silent in low usage and there's adjustments for how it responds to different temperatures.</p>
<p>A definite improvement on my end but temperatures will be higher, since often the fan is running at a much lower speed than before. <em>I'll take a slight increase in temps to not have my Steam Deck simulate my Tinnitus.</em></p>
<p>We also now have experimental support for changing the in-game refresh rate, which will automatically adjust the FPS lock as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12280788131651133425gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12280788131651133425gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11621386971651133424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11621386971651133424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve has also tweaked Desktop Mode, so that the on-screen keyboard will come up automatically in more cases. This is great, hopefully they continue to improve that.</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu getting closer to Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues on the Wii U emulator <a href="http://cemu.info/" target="_blank">Cemu</a> to bring it over to Linux, and with that gain Steam Deck support. The developers still plan to open source it too, with their roadmap indicating it's still scheduled to happen this year.</p>
<p>For the Linux port, the developers put up an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3Rk75PM" target="_blank">Imgur post</a> going over the current status. An important milestone has been hit recently, with the project being able to be compiled on Linux "without errors". After that, they said it "didn't take long until we were able to boot the first few games" with a screenshot shared of it running on a Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6272299981651070193gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6272299981651070193gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plenty more work is still to be done though, so don't expect it too soon. Lots of issues remain from UI problems to porting over various other parts like networking and sound. From what they said we're looking at "1-3 months" before it will be ready to release in public.</p>
<p>They also showed off that it can do OpenGL and H264 video decoding in the port, along with a shot of some of the broken UI. So a ways to go yet but it's coming along nicely it seems.</p>

<p>Do you love Quake? Do you love LEGO? Well, now they've been kind-of combined together to create Block Quake. Yes, someone really did this. It's a total conversion mod for the original Quake, giving you cute plastic blocky styled characters.</p>
<p>It works with multiple different game engines too. You can combine it with the official Quake, which was remastered by Nightdive Studios to the KEX engine but it also works with QuakeSpasm 0.93.2, QuakeSpasm-Spiked and DarkPlaces. So you get to pick and do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p>Block Quake has blocky characters, enemies and boss models, textures and animations. Along with blocky themed weapon pickups, weapon model textures and animations and the list goes on. As much as possible has been changed into this rather silly (but awesome) style.</p>

<p>The developer has plans to continue improving it with new sound effects, a new HUD, possible support for some other modes like QuakeWorld CTF and much more.</p>

      <title>Classic Bethesda titles come to Steam, play them easily on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Bethesda Launcher <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam" target="_blank">shutting down</a>, they've begun the migration to Steam and now some of their classics have become available to download easily.</p>
<p>The titles that have newly arrived on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812290/The_Elder_Scrolls_Arena/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls Arena</a> (free)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</a> (free)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812410/The_Elder_Scrolls_Adventures_Redguard/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812420/An_Elder_Scrolls_Legend_Battlespire/" target="_blank">An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1873030/Wolfenstein_Enemy_Territory/" target="_blank">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a> (free)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can play them all pretty easily on Linux and the Steam Deck too. Probably the best way is with the likes of <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a>, a Steam Play tool that helpfully downloads Native Linux game engines. So you would grab Luxtorpeda (using something like ProtonUp-Qt, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">see my guide</a>) and set Luxtorpeda on them in Steam and it would do the magic for you.</p>
<p>Luxtorpeda will set Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory on Steam to use the far superior <a href="https://www.etlegacy.com/" target="_blank">ET: Legacy</a> (although there is a <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.etlegacy.ETLegacy" target="_blank">Flatpak</a> for this), The Elder Scrolls Arena will use the in-progress <a href="https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena" target="_blank">OpenTESArena</a> project, and then both Redguard and Battlespire will use a Native Linux version of DOSBox.</p>
<p><em>As always, just a suggestion, set them up however you want.</em></p>

      <title>Claustrowordia, a fun free crossword-type game from Ludum Dare 50</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Jam <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 50</a> is over and the overall winner appears to be Claustrowordia, and it turns out it actually is a great crossword-type game.</p>
<p>You're given a basic starting board with a few letters filled, and a few letters of your own to place onto it. The difference here is that you can place your letters anywhere. It's a clever little tweak to the usual word-game and it's pretty amazing that this came from a Game Jam, made solo in 28 hours. I've played quite a bit of it, and it supports a few different languages too. All languages play the same, it just changes the dictionary and word definitions used.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DAaVrbDmAlA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd9740c5d2895d960db357f13a90fbd5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DAaVrbDmAlA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Honestly, it's always amazing to see what comes out of a Game Jam like Super Hot, Surgeon Simulator, Broforce and a great many more.</p>
<p>You can play free by downloading or playing in your browser on the <a href="https://anttihaavikko.itch.io/claustrowordia" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>. The source code is also available for people to learn from on <a href="https://github.com/anttihaavikko/claustrowordia" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (it uses Unity).</p>

      <title>Classic Sonic games being delisted to make way for Sonic Origins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sad day for preservation and emulation, as SEGA has announced that they will be delisting the classic Sonic games.</p>
<p>Why? Well, they have Sonic Origins coming out on June 23. So they will be delisting Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and Sonic CD on May 20. If that alarms you, then you might want to grab them from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34270/SEGA_Mega_Drive_and_Genesis_Classics/" target="_blank">SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics collection</a> (you can buy them individually). That whole collection supports Linux too, and comes with roms, which it appears Sonic Origins will not (on both counts).</p>
<p>The full press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEGA announced today that the company will delist the digital versions of the stand-alone titles that will be featured in the upcoming game, Sonic Origins<strong> </strong>on May 20, 2022.</p>
<p>This will include Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and Sonic CD. There are a couple of exceptions - Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 will remain available via SEGA AGES on the Nintendo Switch and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 will still be playable via Sega Genesis on Nintendo Switch Online +.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delisting means no new purchases but existing owners will continue to have access.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Sonic Origins has a stupid confusing DLC policy mess, just look at this. What have they done to Sonic?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18890225571650991104gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18890225571650991104gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Publisher Devolver Digital were quick to make a <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1516877660370124801" target="_blank">good joke</a> about it.</p>
<p><em>Currently waiting on a little more info from SEGA PR, will update if / when they reply.</em></p>

      <title>Dune: Spice Wars is out in Early Access, works on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The battle for Spice has begun on the sandy planet, with Dune: Spice Wars from Shiro Games and Funcom officially out on Steam in Early Access. Good news for fans of 4x RTS games, as it appears to work great with Steam Play Proton out of the box with no additional tweaking needed. This has been tested on both my desktop with NVIDIA and my Steam Deck with AMD.</p>
<p>"Conquer Arrakis through political maneuvering, military dominance, sabotage, and wise resource allocation. The spice must flow, but as you struggle to wrest it from the grip of opposing factions, the planet itself threatens with coriolis storms and colossal sandworms. Lead the honorable Atreides, brutal Harkonnen, opportunistic Smugglers, or survivalist Fremen, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Specialize your faction by appointing various iconic characters as your councilors."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B2TJHua1EQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dde935b28fc9267697a6c3b268622103.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B2TJHua1EQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I personally grew up with Dune 2 as one of my first strategy games, so I simply could not pass up the opportunity to play this one (personal purchase). First impressions count of course and so far, so good. It definitely looks and feels a bit like a sci-fi Northgard, with a few of the mechanics being quite similar and the UI also feels close there too. Not a bad thing though, Northgard is great and Shiro clearly learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, it works well and performs quite nicely from my initial test. The interface even looks okay, although the problem is the text size (which a lot of games suffer with on Deck) being in many places too small. Playable on Deck for sure but not overly comfortable due to that. No issues with that on my Linux desktop of course.</p>
<p>Not a big surprise that it works out of the box, especially since it has options for OpenGL or DirectX. Both appear to work on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Screenshots from desktop (click pictures to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20402392631650983496gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20402392631650983496gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10498733641650983494gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10498733641650983494gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance on Steam Deck appears to be far better if you use the <u>OpenGL</u> option. I saw a good 10-15FPS improvement on Deck by using OpenGL. Steam Deck screenshot on High settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5075711121650984664gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5075711121650984664gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sebastien Vidal, Shiro games CEO says, “We’re all very proud of the current state of the game as we enter Early Access. It's the beginning of a journey, and the game is only going to keep expanding from here, with the help of valuable player feedback."</p>
<p>Through Early Access they have plans to add in a full story campaign, multiplayer and more.</p>

      <title>Loop Hero gets controller support, looking good on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Loop Hero, the fantastic deck-builder from Four Quarters and Devolver Digital now has controller support, making it work even better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A big update is on the way too, which they say stalled around the 80% mark but work on that will continue again as almost "all graphics and code are finished, mostly texts/sounds/balance remain". Until then though, this small update to work with controllers / gamepads is a nice addition to an already great game.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, Valve gave it a Playable rating previously but this should bump it right up to Verified status as the control system and icons were the issue which is now solved. Feels really good on Deck too, and the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1282730/discussions/0/3278066986694410834/#c3278066986694603454" target="_blank">solved</a> a problem I reported very quickly.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4975014171650975428gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4975014171650975428gol1.jpg"/></a><em>I once again fear for my free time now…</em></p>
<p>The situation is a bit different for the Native Linux version, which is the default on normal desktops. As they use Game Maker, which really doesn't have the best gamepad support on Linux. Four Quarters only officially support the Sony DualShock 4 there and sure enough, my Xbox pad was very broken in it. If that bothers you, switching to Proton can solve it.</p>
<p>You can buy Loop Hero on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/loop_hero" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/loop-hero?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282730/Loop_Hero/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD driver work ongoing to help Halo Infinite on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Bas Nieuwenhuizen has a new blog post up about some of the work going into the radv AMD GPU driver on Linux, and they're taking steps towards doing "<a href="https://www.basnieuwenhuizen.nl/a-driver-on-the-gpu/" target="_blank">A driver on the GPU</a>" which should help Halo Infinite get working.</p>
<p>One of the problems with Halo Infinite on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton, is to do with the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer VKD3D-Proton and how a certain part of Direct3D 12 is being used in a "non-trivial" way. Getting that properly supported sounds like it has been difficult.</p>
<p>The full blog post goes into some highly <em>technical</em> details that most people won't understand, but what they're doing is sending a bunch of the work to the GPU by adding some support for the Vulkan extension <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_device_generated_commands.html" target="_blank">VK_NV_device_generated_commands</a>. Sounds like some parts of the Vulkan specification may need some tweaks or adjustments based on what they're doing, and what's actually "allowed".</p>
<p>A key point though is not to expect this to come any time soon, as Nieuwenhuizen explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t expect this upstream very quickly. The main reason for exploring this in radv is <code class="inline-code">ExecuteIndirect</code> support for Halo Infinite, and after some recent updates we’re back into GPU hang limbo with radv/vkd3d-proton there. So while we’re solving that I’m holding off on upstreaming in case the hangs are caused by the implementation of this extension.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is only a partial implementation of the extension anyways, with a fair number of limitations that we’d ideally eliminate before fully exposing this extension.</p>

      <title>AI War 2: The Neinzul Abyss DLC out, Arcen finished with it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The massive-scale space RTS AI War 2 has a new expansion out with AI War 2: The Neinzul Abyss, and it seems Arcen are now finished with the game and moving onto their next project.</p>
<p>Arcen say this expansion is bigger than some standalone games, and the game has lost the "Beta" status for multiplayer as it seems to all work fine now. On the game as a whole, they're not working full-time on it now and consider it pretty much done. However, they will be around watching over it to put out bug fixes whenever they're needed.</p>
<p>Their next title is already in progress, but it is not set in their existing "Arcenverse" of sci-fi games.</p>
<p>For AI War 2: The Neinzul Abyss, the expansion allows you to be a "Necromancer", giving you control over a mobile fleet that feasts on the living from other universes. Capture enemy guard posts, make skeletons and wights out of enemy ships.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19744858831650967957gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19744858831650967957gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8958408401650967958gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8958408401650967958gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also a bunch of new factions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Neinzul Sappers can be the ultimate ally... for you or your enemies</li>
<li>Neinzul Elderlings are giant creatures you can unleash to roam around the galaxy, even without the necromancer</li>
<li>Neinzul Custodians are fractured groups of Neinzul that have found their way to our galaxy that will show undying loyalty to any that accept them</li>
<li>Neinzul Migrant Fleets constantly appear at random on the map, either opening up new holes in your enemies' defenses or aggravating them and leaving you to pick up the pieces</li>
<li>Neinzul Wild Hives appear to be relatively peaceful if left alone, but their hives actively inhibit the abilities of any ships within their territory</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus, free updates to 'The Spire Rises' Expansion</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Ark Empire player type</li>
<li>Spire-Insued Empire player type</li>
<li>Modular Ships</li>
<li>New Chromatic Horror faction</li>
<li>Several new Spire Dyson Sphere factions</li>
<li>Warheads and Interplanetary Weapons, related to the spire dyson sphere factions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 reimplementation OpenRCT2 has a new save system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work that has been ongoing for some time now, <a href="https://openrct2.org/" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the free and open source reimplementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 version 0.4.0 is out now and it's big. If you want to play it easily on Linux from Steam, you can do so with <em>Luxtorpeda</em>. I have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">a guide on using that</a> on the Steam Deck in a previous article. Or, you can use the version from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>With the huge change being to the save file system, one of their time previously told me that it "significantly raises pretty much all the limits the original sv6 format had and is probably the biggest milestone we have hit since OpenRCT2 started over 7 years ago".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8424224531650966608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8424224531650966608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other improvements in this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow up to 255 trains per ride.</li>
<li>Path surfaces and railings can be mixed and matched, like in RCT1.</li>
<li>The Fruity Ices Stall can now be recoloured, like in RCT1.</li>
<li>The Corkscrew, Twister and Vertical Drop Roller Coasters can now draw inline twists.</li>
<li>Allow map sizes of 999 × 999 (up from 254 × 254).</li>
<li>Custom music objects that are distributed with the save.</li>
<li>Various plugin improvements.</li>
<li>Cheats are now saved with the park.</li>
<li>Increased image limit in the engine.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>Space station building and management sim orbit.industries is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy a fresh take on building up a space station? orbit.industries from LAB132 and Klabater is out now. So far so good, with it having a number of positive user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>"Jump into 3 modes: Campaign with missions set in the orbit of far flung alien worlds, Endless mode where resources are limited but time is not, or Creative mode where you can let your imagination run wild in the orbital sandbox with no constraints. Orbit.industries blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sCUzO6Gd5ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2baeb4fdb58b74749411da3a822da53d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sCUzO6Gd5ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full 360 degrees, 3D view of an orbital station within Unreal Engine 4</li>
<li>An abstract 2D stylized view of management cycles and resource planning</li>
<li>3 Gameplay Modes: Campaign, Creative and Endless</li>
<li>54 Modules varieties to build and design your station with</li>
<li>A technological tree to explore and expand</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see a building sim with a slightly more realistic look and style to the tech we have now, with all the modules looking a lot like what we can do now. Seems like a good one to take a look at it you love space games.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/orbitindustries?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1668130/orbitindustries/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Steam Deck gets a lock screen, window switcher and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a huge upgrade for the Steam Deck that includes some much requested features, that should dramatically improve the overall experience. The update comes in multiple parts (Client and OS), and should be done via Gaming Mode (the main Deck UI), <em>not</em> Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>Here's the big features:</p>
<p><strong>Lock Screen</strong> - as many requested, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-improves-offline-mode-switching-looks-like-a-lock-screen-is-coming/" target="_blank">as we saw hints of</a>, it's here! You can now feel a bit more secure without someone just pressing the power and doing whatever they want to your Deck. Available to show up on wake, boot, login, and/or when switching to Desktop mode. Available via the new Security menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13325012821650963200gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13325012821650963200gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16691026871650963199gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16691026871650963199gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Updated Achievements Page</strong> - The Deck has a nicer looking way to view game Steam Achievements now.</p>
<p><strong>Localized Keyboards</strong> - Another frankly <em>essential</em> feature, instead of forcing everyone into one language there's now 21 available. Keyboards for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are also on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Window Switching</strong> - FINALLY! Hopefully far less annoyance from game launchers now. You can tap the Steam button to get a list of open windows and swap between them. Before this, the Deck would flash violently between them and it was horrible. Good to see Valve act on this major nuisance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15947883591650965910gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15947883591650965910gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Warning for slow chargers</strong> - The Deck will actually tell you if you plug in a charger that's too slow.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Half-Rate Shading</strong> - Allowing you to force 2x2 Variable Rate Shading into existing games for power savings.</p>
<p>Plenty of other improvements came along with this including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New achievements drop down allows players to quickly compare stats against any friend who also plays</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">Add Friend and Pending Requests have been combined into a single new page for better handling of friend requests</div>
</li>
<li>Added logic to detect and notify user when a microSD card doesn't match advertised storage size and specifications, instead of attempting to format (for a very long time)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam and (...) button couldn't be used with Remote Play when streaming games from PC</li>
<li>More performance improvements for players with very large game libraries</li>
<li>The LED now dims a few seconds after plugging in / unplugging (so it's less annoying at nighttime)</li>
<li>Battery life is improved in idle or very low usage scenarios.</li>
<li>Compatibility has been improved for Type-C docks, chargers, and SD cards</li>
<li>SD card formatting now tests to see if a card has less storage than advertised</li>
<li>An uncapped framerate option is now available in the Performance tab of the Quick Access Menu</li>
<li>fTPM support has been added, allowing for Windows 11 installation</li>
<li>Overall stability has been improved</li>
</ul>

      <title>Twitter agrees to Elon Musk buyout, a reminder we&#39;re on Mastodon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, one of the biggest things on the social internet happened, with Elon Musk buying Twitter. So here's a little reminder of Mastodon. Not our usual news, but it's too big to be ignored. Twitter is a massive and important platform and now it's going to be wholly owned by Elon Musk. Regardless of your thoughts on Musk, it's still a little alarming.</p>
<p>Good news for those who do dislike Musk, as there is a great alternative available with <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. Not perfect, nothing is, but it is a good option to try. It's very much like Twitter except it's free, open source, has no adverts and anyone can host their own instance. Thanks to how it's designed, people can follow and talk to each other across these instances too.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux is on Mastodon</a>, so feel free to give us a follow. If you don't care about this whole thing, you can also <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html" target="_blank">Press Release</a>:</p>
<p>Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, "The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders."</p>
<p>Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, "Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important."</p>
<p>"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," said Mr. Musk. "I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."</p>
<p><em>It will be interesting to see if Musk does open up more of Twitter.</em></p>

      <title>Linux distro Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS from System76 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 has today released the latest version of their own Linux distribution, with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS</a>.</p>
<p>The basics are that they've rebased on top of Ubuntu 22.04 for their packaging, with it being an LTS it's supported for 5 years with updates. Also included is the more up to date Linux Kernel 5.16.19 at release (and they do regular updates), Mesa 22 drivers and GNOME 42 with their COSMIC interface. Plenty more tweaks are included with this release too, so here's a quick run-down.</p>
<p>Automatic updates are available in the new OS Upgrade &amp; Recovery panel in Settings, allowing you to set what time and day you want them to happen. Notifications for updates are also now shown weekly, they said it's to "reduce distractions" but you can change that frequency too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16652208261650900193gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16652208261650900193gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The settings menu also has a new Support panel, giving you various options to get help from articles to support chat. You can change what background you want between light and dark modes, better performance with their newer System76 Scheduler — they said this "optimizes performance by directing resources to the window in focus" which should help gaming. PipeWire is now the default for audio too, so you get the latest and greatest way to handle it all on Linux, something <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/pipewire-is-the-future-for-linux-audio-and-i-am-sold-on-it/" target="_blank">I am a big fan of</a>.</p>
<p>Pop!_Shop, their software store, saw plenty of upgrades too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Backend code improvements for more responsive operations</li>
<li>Improved reliability for package operations (update, install, etc.)</li>
<li>UI Improvements to aid in allowing small window sizes for tiling</li>
<li>Update and Install buttons now also function as a progress bar</li>
<li>New "Recently Updated" homepage section highlighting newly added/updated apps</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Various other improvements include better multi-monitor support with the workspaces view, a fixed layout on HiDPI displays and increased performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20109686241650900310gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20109686241650900310gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Outside of that, they sent over this list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Installed NVIDIA drivers are now visible in Pop!_Shop, and will no longer include an “Install” button. Older drivers are also available to install, though the most recent available NVIDIA driver is recommended for most NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
<li>Better performance with improvements to the CPU scaling governor, which keeps your CPU running at the optimal frequency for your system.</li>
<li>The Pop!_OS upgrade service will now only activate when checking for or performing release upgrades. (Previously it was active 24/7.).</li>
<li>If your upgrade gets interrupted, debian packages are now resumable—meaning you can pick up the upgrade from where you left off.</li>
<li>File type for icons has been changed to .svg.</li>
<li>Max disk capacity for journald logs is now limited to 1GB.</li>
<li>Added support for laptop privacy screens.</li>
<li>RDP by default for remote desktop use.</li>
<li>Better performance, scaling, and reliability in Pop!_Shop.</li>
<li>Added this funky <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/default-settings/commit/77e14a2847fada0e979b1bb519e4f291b7bb3246" target="_blank">new user icon</a>.</li>

      <title>Turn customers into food in Godlike Burger - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turn customers into food in Godlike Burger, to serve more customers. This is like the opposite of the Overcooked series. Okay, perhaps not the opposite, but Overcooked's evil twin maybe. Developed by Liquid Pug with publishing from Daedalic Entertainment, this new Native Linux release looks hilarious.</p>
<p>Here you play as a murderous chef who seems to love the taste of aliens. With the use of your flying diner, you need to find all the tastiest ingredients around, which means luring customers into traps and then turning them into delicious meals to fatten people up to create more exotic dishes. Then use your monies to keep upgrading, improve your restaurant reputation and hopefully avoid the space police.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Kill your customers with a range of hidden traps or the good old meat cleaver! Their delicious meat is your special ingredient after all.</li>
<li>Cook the best burgers and turn your pitiful burger joint into the universe’s most famous restaurant.</li>
<li>Improve your kitchen and find out what each alien race likes - uncover the secret of the perfect burger.</li>
<li>Explore the galaxy and its worlds. There are different alien species and their individual strengths and weaknesses to discover.</li>
<li>Don’t get caught! Leave no witnesses and keep the police’s suspicion low by playing and planning smartly.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valheim is absolutely smashing it with 10 million copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate has announced that their single-player and online co-op survival game Valheim has managed to hit a massive milestone of sales.</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter, their team <a href="https://twitter.com/Valheimgame/status/1518591911497412608" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Valheim" target="_blank">#Valheim</a> has sold over 10 million copies! Thank you to every single one of you who got us to this milestone – when we launched the game we could never in our wildest dreams have imagined this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not even remotely surprised by this, considering how absolutely enamoured by it I was when it first came out, spending every free moment running through the lands to explore. I think it certainly helped that they had quite an expansive free Alpha version available for quite a while before release, which pulled in quite a lot of eyes on it.</p>
<p>Valheim is quite a <em>magical</em> game really, which does things so differently to other survival game it's simply brilliant. The team at Iron Gate fully deserve all the sales they can possibly get, it's easily one of the best games I've played over the last few years.</p>

<p>Currently, the developers at Iron Gate are working away on the very exciting upcoming update for The Mistlands, which will bring another full biome to the game.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's Steam Deck Verified and has an Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>As for Fall Guys, it now works without issues. Really, the developer just needs to put things in the right place as they've put up the actual Easy Anti-Cheat file needed that works. Until then though, using GE-Proton is the easiest way to go. For those who love their video guides:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0a9UsXffb3s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6446fe396e2a2844bd1eedbcf14382c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0a9UsXffb3s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you find it doesn't work, check to ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library.</p>
<p>You can buy Fall Guys on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for Epic and GOG on Linux and Steam Deck new Beta available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher is a very simple to use free and open source app to manage and download your Epic Games Store and GOG collections on Linux and Steam Deck. It's great, one of my regular apps on both my desktop and Deck and now it's in the process of getting a clean-up operation with <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta.1" target="_blank">version 2.3.0 Beta 1</a> now available.</p>
<p><em>If you want a stable experience, stick with the current version, as bugs are to be expected.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21473275631650883085gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21473275631650883085gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the changes includes the integration of Winetricks, an improved language selector for games, a fix for special characters on Wine prefix folders, lots of user interface flow improvements, GOG user credentials are no longer stored in plain text (the token generated, not username / password), GOG setup improvements, an option to hide games from your library, auto-update for AppImage and various other bug fixes and small improvements.</p>
<p>Really great to see the continued improvements on such an essential app.</p>

      <title>Discord Overlay for Linux v0.5.1 out with notifications, other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get an easy to use on-screen Discord Overlay for Linux and Steam Deck? <a href="https://trigg.github.io/Discover/" target="_blank">Discover Overlay</a> v0.5.1 is out now. It's incredibly useful when you're in a group gaming session, chatting away and you want an easy to see list of who is in the chat (both voice and text channels supported). Good for video recordings too, for viewers to know who is who.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added system notification support</li>
<li>Huge overhaul of connector which hopefully fixes rate limit / temporary API bans</li>
<li>Improved default settings</li>
<li>Gave each module a named logger rather than "Root"</li>
<li>Fixed Autostart on boot</li>
<li>Prevent multiple Flatpak instances</li>
<li>Fix HiDPI floating window placement</li>
<li>Other but fixes!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Using it on Linux is wonderfully simple, and it works quite well on the Steam Deck too. You can check out a quick test I did previously on the Steam Deck below:</p>

      <title>Turbo Overkill should see full Linux and Steam Deck support for the 1.0 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turbo Overkill, a brand new Blade Runner-meets-DOOM hellscape FPS from Trigger Happy Interactive and Apogee Entertainment is out in Early Access. It looks quite awesome, and the press email came to me directly so I decided to ask the all important questions.</p>
<p>In reply to my questioning on any plans to support it on Linux and the Steam Deck, the official reply that came back was: "We are targeting 1.0 release for both optimized Steam Deck support and native Linux support." — so there you have it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ht0fbsgtw_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9b6a11f80a5d64e034fc4e0d46f2db7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ht0fbsgtw_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by genre giants like Quake II, Titanfall, and BioShock, Turbo Overkill marries hyperspeed, pixel-perfect gunplay with the freedom to try different playstyles. Outrun and outgun with frenzied stunts like wall-running, grapple-swinging, and car-surfing. Upgrade the arm rockets for devastating close-range volleys. Reap aggressive rewards with chainsaw leg mods that increase mobility or restore health with kills.</p>
<p>"To this day, the classic shooters I grew up on are still masterclasses in tight, focused design," said Sam Prebble, one-half of Trigger Happy Interactive. "Turbo Overkill kneels at the altar of the greats, but I admire how modern games give us more ways to express ourselves. I can’t wait to see how players and their badass creativity blow my levels wide open."</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328350/Turbo_Overkill/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>dbrand made a slick &#39;Teardown&#39; skin for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days where you could buy tech with clear casing? I loved my Game Boy Pocket that had it, and now you can sort-of get there thanks to dbrand with their <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/teardown?category=skin&amp;device=steam-deck#buy" target="_blank">Teardown skin</a> for the Steam Deck. This doesn't show up in their normal skin selector for the Steam Deck, as it's a special edition.</p>
<p>It might not be see-through casing but it's close enough, and dbrand jokingly said on <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1516204410787053576" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Steam Decks died for this.". I must admit, it really does look cool and dbrand skins are high-quality too so you can't really go wrong with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12193476231650879039gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12193476231650879039gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11022628361650879038gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11022628361650879038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Teardown comes in two versions with either Gloss or Ultramatte, depending on your preference and both look just as good. What you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special Edition Front Skin</li>
<li>Special Edition Back Skin</li>
<li>Special Edition Trackpad Skin (×2)</li>
<li>Microfiber Cloth</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost: $49.95.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wish this had come out before I did something else, and you can see how I totally ruined mine below:</p>

      <title>See what&#39;s eating up drive space on the Steam Deck with Filelight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a <em>quick</em> tip for you on the Steam Deck: how to find out where all that drive space is going with a sweet program called Filelight. This will work great on Linux desktops too, since it's just a KDE application.</p>
<p>Available as a Flatpak package, you can easily install it from Flathub. On the Steam Deck (or a Linux desktop running Plasma), you can load up the Discover store and look for Filelight. You can also use Flatseal to allow access to other parts of your system, like an SD Card.</p>
<p>Filelight gives you quite a rather gorgeous and simple way to look through your storage, and find something perhaps you've left laying around that was forgotten. You can click inside each folder, and keep going deep until you see exactly where that space has gone.</p>

<p><u>Note</u>: if you don't see it listed, you may need to add the Flathub Beta Remote using this command in terminal (Steam Deck has it by default):</p>
<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo</code></p>
<p>For normal Linux desktops (not the Steam Deck), it's also usually available in your standard software repositories. Use whatever packing system you prefer.</p>

      <title>Terraformers, a relaxed game about turning the Red Planet green, out now</title>
      <author>Philadelphus</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released into early access on April 21 (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244800/Terraformers/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/terraformers" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://goblinzstudio.com/game/terraformers/" target="_blank">Terraformers</a> is a game about growing and developing a network of cities on Mars, with the eventual goal of (what else) terraforming it. </p>
<p>Gameplay takes place over a number of turns (each representing one Martian year), and involves both the surface of Mars and a zoomed-in look at the individual cities you place, which have spots to place up to fifteen buildings. Areas on the planet are represented by a web of connected nodes, which you explore throughout the game. This allows you to find resources, either one-time boosts, or sources that can be mined to provide a continuous production. Each turn, you get to pick from a number of projects which you can spend your acquired resources on. These projects can be buildings, which can be built either in cities or on the Martian surface depending on the building, or space projects which require trade routes to provide the necessary resources but can provide some powerful rewards in turn. Trade routes can also be used to trade with Earth, allowing you to export some resource you might have too much of at the moment for something you critically need.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M-8kcB-Qsa0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/076047ffe9173faf01884dcb8fc9d0e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M-8kcB-Qsa0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Every ten turns, you get to choose a new leader, which will provide some unique bonus actions you can use. Every leader can explore a region on the planet, but they can also do things like clear rocks blocking building sites in cities for free, give you free buildings, provide resources like power or food, and other things which can be quite helpful. Each leader also comes with a “specialization,” a bonus which continues in effect even after that leader has retired (so that you accrue more of them as the game goes on); this might be things like decreasing the cost of building mines, or giving you a bonus production of +1 titanium for every two titanium production you set up. Leaders come from a wide pool of cultures around the globe, which I thought was a nice touch and provides a bit of visual character. (Some leaders you can encounter later in the game are even said to be the descendants of earlier leaders you might have chosen, providing a reminder of the time scale over which the game takes place.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15821174431650776417gol4404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15821174431650776417gol4404.jpg"/></a><small>Here you can see the planet's surface, with three cities and their networks of controlled regions.</small></p>
<p>Along the way, you need to keep the “support” of your Martian populace up, or face public sentiment turning against you and losing the game if it reaches zero. Certain buildings provide bonuses to support, and exploring new and exciting places often gives one-time boosts, but over time the population starts to have higher expectations, represented by increasingly larger drops in support happening periodically over time. A typical game for me starts off with support being positive and banking a large store of it, then a long mid-section where it’s negative and I need to keep it up by exploration and having enough stored, then finally an end-game where it becomes positive again as terraforming starts to take hold and conditions outside the cities become more tolerable. (I’ve never personally lost a game to losing support, but I've heard of it and could see it happening if you don’t prioritize it enough!)</p>
<p>As you develop your colony, you'll start getting projects to terraform the planet. There are four parameters: atmosphere, heat, oxygen, and oceans, and different buildings provide various bonuses. You can breach aquifers to provide a one-time boost to ocean progress (instead of using them to supply water over time), and there are space projects that can provide large boosts to various parameters as well. Eventually, you'll be able to start introducing life; Mars's surface is broken into a number of “climate zones,“ with each zone able to hold one type of bacteria, plant, and animal. These have different requirements (penguins can obviously handle colder temperatures than elephants!), and provide different bonuses: Methanogenium bacteria increase temperature, for instance, Tundra Forests provide oxygen and atmosphere, and animals can keep your people happy and supportive. I'm still learning how the system works, but it's nice to watch the surface of Mars slowly turn green as oceans spread across the dry and dusty plains.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6846839511650776419gol4404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6846839511650776419gol4404.jpg"/></a><small>This is the city interface screen, where you can place buildings. Quite a few have adjacency bonuses, making efficient cities an interesting puzzle.</small></p>
<p>If all this sounds interesting, you can actually play a free, standalone prologue on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1557040/Terraformers_First_Steps_on_Mars/" target="_blank">Terraformers: First Steps on Mars</a> which was released last October (see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/colonize-the-red-planet-in-terraformers-first-steps-on-mars-a-free-prologue-out-now/" target="_blank">this previous article</a>). It’s not the same as the full game, as the developers have iterated on it since then and changed several features (for the better), but it gives a good indication of what the game is like. The prologue is limited to 30 turns, but in the full game you have no turn limit and the challenge is simply in being more efficient and completing the goals of the various scenarios in as few turns as possible. Speaking of which, there are a number of scenarios at the moment with goals like “get this many victory points” (calculated from a variety of things), “produce this much of these specific resources,” or “fully terraform the planet.” While there’s currently no free-play option, the developers released a <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/38311261/117f8edcaa7f2e74ef096f8de079c4b5d9aaebc2.png" target="_blank">roadmap</a> upon the game releasing into early-access and that’s one of the first few goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11980279381650776420gol4404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11980279381650776420gol4404.jpg"/></a>Some of the projects you get to choose from each turn. (Normally you start with just three choices; in this screenshot I've built some buildings that increase the number available, and this is actually the largest I've ever seen.)</p>
<p>Terraformers plays fine on Linux, and has had a native version from the first day the prologue came out (and even before that when it was a Steam Next Fest demo). On release, Terraformers had a critical bug on Linux that prevented progress past the first turn, but after a few people reported it on the game’s Discord server the developers were very responsive and fixed it the next day. (In the meantime, it worked flawlessly on Proton.) Other than that I’ve never encountered a crash or major bug in my nine hours in the prologue or the eight hours I’ve played of the full game so far, so I have no reservations recommending it.</p>
<p>Overall I quite enjoy Terraformers; it’s a relaxing game with a great art style and no time pressure, which allows you to challenge yourself to beat your previous best. (It has a bit of a “board game” feel to it, if that makes sense.) If there's one thing I'm not entirely sold on it's that there's definitely a large element of randomness to the game. The map is randomly generated each time, so sometimes you might find yourself searching for a while to find more minable nodes of a particular resource or good locations for cities (which can only be built on certain nodes on the planet's surface). Generally, however, it averages out of the course of a game (typically ~50 turns or so in my experience with the scenarios so far), and trade routes do a good job of letting you mitigate resource shortages. This is the fourth game about terraforming Mars in my Steam library, and I expect it’ll be one I return to for a long time to come, especially as the developers continue to add more to it.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.7 is out with more PE conversion work and theme additions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). A new biweekly development release is out now with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.7" target="_blank">Wine 7.7</a>.</p>
<p>It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights in Wine 7.7:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More progress on the PE conversion of the X11 and OSS drivers.</li>
<li>Support for UTF-8 as default Ansi codepage.</li>
<li>Theming support for control panel applets.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's sometimes asked: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>They only noted 11 bugs were found to be solved as of this release including issues with Anno 1602 / 1602 A.D., Steam and other miscellaneous issues.</p>

      <title>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a sprawling FOSS apocalypse roguelike</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA" target="_blank">Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</a>, CDDA for short, is a free and open source apocalypse-themed roguelike that is incredibly deep and a ton of fun to play. If you haven't heard of it, think of a turn-based Project Zomboid, but in addition to zombies, CDDA features alien fungi, eldritch horrors, giant skeletons, and dozens of other monsters eager to add you to the billions of victims of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>The core gameplay loop will be familiar to fans of Zomboid: you start with little equipment or knowledge, but as you gain experience and find or craft equipment and build a base an you can eke out a life on the fringes of the apocalypse. While the base game is ASCII, releases also includes several tilesets - I am using one of the included tilesets, Ultica.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10352092901650652460gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10352092901650652460gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here I am a few moments after one of my first forays into the world of CDDA. I have spawned inside a FEMA evacuation shelter, and while checking the lockers for supplies I hear some terrible noises outside a window, indicated by the yellow icons. Stupidly, I draw back the curtains to take a look, and an undead horde smashes the windows and spills into the shelter, quickly chasing me down and ending my pitifully short life. Welcome to the apocalypse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6540314401650652459gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6540314401650652459gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>While the game <em>is</em> unforgiving, after a few tries (and some better luck with your spawn) you can become an absolute zombie terminator. On my current save I have fared considerably better. I march through the streets clad in heavy SWAT Kevlar and a Guy Fawkes mask, swinging my fire axe to cleave through hordes of zombies while occasionally popping batteries into  my mp3 player (the music helps me stay calm). Exploring an eerily quiet town a week after the apocalypse I came across a swimming pool filled with webbed zombies that had evolved to live in the water along with a terrifying half-crocodile half-zombie. After spotting me through the glass walls of the pool, the horde smashed the glass and rushed across the street to show me their bathing suits. It took me two days to drag all the corpses into a pit and burn them, and I now have a delightful collection of swimwear.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10874849231650652459gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10874849231650652459gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>The best example of the complexity of CDDA is its crafting system. There are hundreds of recipes, and navigating them all and understanding how to craft them is made simple through a powerful crafting interface. You can search through the recipes you know with a search engine that accepts wild cards and allows searching based on ingredients, proficiency required to craft, the characteristics of the crafted item, and more. I have never seen such a powerful or enjoyable crafting system, and it may be the single greatest feat of the game. I know this looks complicated (and it is) but if you spend a bit of time with it you'll recognize how well designed it is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14278263801650654330gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14278263801650654330gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>In addition to the more immediate physical threats of the apocalypse, your survivor is faced with battling starvation, dehydration, extreme temperatures, exhaustion, illness, addiction, and even depression. You can break your leg falling off a roof, go deaf from firing a rifle indoors, and be blinded by goo.</p>
<p>As time passes, the environment around you changes. Monsters evolve into more terrifying monsters. Like Project Zomboid, this is not a game with a happy ending for your character. Two weeks into the apocalypse, having chopped up most of the undead population of a small town, I was faced with a new problem: giant bugs, presumably attracted by the rotting corpses I had left in the street. Investigating a basement in one house with a flashlight I am met with a horrifying sight (and stench): a giant nest of cockroaches, mutated giant bugs, and their droppings covering the floor. You can see me on the staircase to the right.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8694143831650652458gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8694143831650652458gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>I dash back up the stairs but am pursued by the larger bugs, one of which slashes open my leg. A pitched battle ensues, and I limp home with the resolution to leave the basement bugs in peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14155096701650652457gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14155096701650652457gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>CDDA also features a bizarre cast of NPCs that try to survive the apocalypse along with you. One man I met was convinced that government corruption had something to do with the apocalypse, and implored me to find files in a nearby Federal building that would prove him right. I politely told him I would look into it. Another man asked me to find an American flag for him; his concern, presumably, was that the apocalypse had led to flagging (sorry) patriotism. One woman I met was convinced that the Cataclysm was connected with the songs she could hear emanating from animal bones. Some of these NPCs can be convinced to join you, after which they can guard you, be set to work at your base, teach you skills or perform first aid on you, and countless other options. Not all NPCs are so helpful, though, and the potential for violence is never far from your interactions with strangers.</p>
<p>There are also vehicles that you can build, find, hotwire, modify, and operate. And by 'vehicles' I mean everything from a canoe to a helicopter. There are giant swords and medieval armours. There are wild beagles. There are nuclear weapons. Despite having 40 or so hours in the game, I feel that I know next to nothing about it or what is possible. And that's a great feeling.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA" target="_blank">download CDDA here</a>, and <a href="https://discord.gg/jFEc7Yp" target="_blank">check out the discord here</a> - the community is great about helping new players find their feet.</p>

      <title>Lumencraft hits 20,000 copies in the first week, roadmap detailed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft, a recent Early Access release from 2Dynamic Games that offers up Native Linux support powered by Godot Engine seems to have been a hit.</p>
<p>Blending together a top-down shooter with tower defense strategy elements, and mining through every wall you possibly can to get resources, it's quite something. I got fully sucked into blasting through it on release day and can't wait to see all the extras they plan to add in.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1713810/view/3175610095142586911" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, they announced the 20,000 milestone for the first 7 days. Given how many games are releasing all the time, it's still a nice achievement considering this is an in-development title.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ldgf-iLMxxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493d922b67e640f1d193323e211786bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ldgf-iLMxxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what's to come for the game, they've now also put up a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1713810/view/3175610095142969333" target="_blank">roadmap</a> and it sounds pretty exciting including: new maps, new terrain textures, a better user interface, hero classes, robot helper pets, more enemies and weapons, dynamic water and eventually at the full release there will also be a story campaign to play through.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/lumencraft?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713810/Lumencraft/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Underwater chaos expands with the Barotrauma &#39;Urban Expanses&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to find out what it's like to travel in a submarine on another planet? Barotrauma gives you that option and it can be total chaos. It's a 2D co-op survival horror inspired by the likes of FTL, RimWorld, Space Station 13 and others like that. With silly ragdoll physics, and plenty of strange creatures waiting for you.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access, it just received a nice big update named Urban Expanses. This adds in a new creatur called The Latcher, which you can encounter earlier than their two previous abyss monsters, so there can be a little frantic fun earlier in the game now. Modding should now be easier to both use and create, a new money system that's a bit more flexible giving players personal wallets and a crew bank and a huge overhaul to the big colony outposts to "make them look and feel like real cities".</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder adds gamepad support, works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder is a rogue-like tactics army battler that I was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/uh-oh-looks-like-despots-game-dystopian-army-builder-is-going-to-suck-all-my-time-away/" target="_blank">absolutely in love with</a> when it first entered Early Access and now on the Steam Deck I love it all over again.</p>
<p>You build up a little army of fleshy people and equip them with all sorts of weird combinations like: a bow and arrow, a sword stuck in stone, a rabbit in a hat, a stale pretzel, an American football and the list of weird weapons goes on and on. When ready, you run through dungeons room by room and face off against various robotic creations (and other horrors) while your people auto-battle. It's thoroughly odd but really engrossing to play through.</p>
<p>It's closing in on the 1.0 release, and a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1227280/view/3220645457117599668" target="_blank">update</a> rolled out recently which amongst other things, added in controller / gamepad support. Naturally, I took it for a spin on the Steam Deck and apart from some tutorial quirks, it feels really <em>great</em> to play on it. Can easily see this getting a Deck Verified rating once it's more polished.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to become the overlord of others in Stellaris? You're going to get your chance when Stellaris: Overlord releases officially on May 12, 2022.</p>
<p>This is a full expansion too, not just some little pack. Not only that but the latest free update version 3.4 "Cepheus" is launching at the same time. This free update will bring plenty of new content and improvements for all players worked on by their "Custodian Team".</p>
<p>Here's what the new expansion will give you:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rulers Make the Rules</strong>: New vassalization mechanics let you define the role of your new subjects - create new Specialist Empires to grow into economic superpowers, military specialists, and technological creators. Negotiate or demand contracts and agreements between your vassals to define the future of dozens of worlds, and reap the benefits!</li>
<li><strong>The Brightest Star Must Guide Them</strong>: Seek out and unite scattered empires across the stars! As you explore the vast galaxy you’ll encounter more unique enclaves of people, from mysterious shroudwalkers to militaristic mercenaries and crafty salvagers. Will you forge a mutually beneficial relationship and earn their unique services, or will they submit to your rule by force?</li>
<li><strong>Five New Origins to Lord Over</strong>:<br/>
	 - Imperial Fiefdom - You may be just a Specialist Empire now, but some day, the galaxy may need a new ruler… don’t leave any doubt that it will be you.<br/>
	 - Slingshot to the Stars - The ruined remains of a Quantum Catapult have been discovered near your homeworld - what secrets might it unlock if your people are clever enough to bring it back online?<br/>
	 - Subterranean - Your species adapted to life underground, excelling in mining and archaeology. Now it’s time to see what awaits you far, far above the surface.<br/>
	 - Teachers of the Shroud - Developing in contact with the curious psions known as the Shroudwalkers, your empire has learned a thing or two about expanding their minds!<br/>
	 - Progenitor Hive - Under your leadership, this hivemind empire can achieve more than ever before… but without your guidance, the hive will fall to ruin!</li>
<li><strong>Engineer the Future and Showcase Your Power</strong>: New feats of technology will give your empire the edge it needs to become the dominant force across the galaxy.<br/>
	 - Orbital Rings will elevate your influence (and defense) in grand displays of power  from your planets further into space.<br/>
	 - Hyper Relays will give your fleets the ability to enforce your will across the stars faster than ever before.<br/>
	 - Quantum Catapults enable new ways to react quicker in the galaxy while projecting your might - but it’s a daring one-way trip for your fleet!</li>
<li><strong>Four</strong> new music tracks to inspire your rise to greatness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Lutris now has a Flatpak Beta available and updated for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not quite ready just yet to be a one-click install, the game manager Lutris is at least now available with various improvements as a Flatpak Beta.</p>
<p>The what: the point of Lutris is to bring together many different launchers (Steam, Epic Games, Origin, GOG, Ubisoft), along with support for running games through Wine and Emulation too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, the Flatpak means you no longer have to mess around with disabling the read-only filesystem. However, it still needs an extra couple steps to make sure it's installed and able to run correctly. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load up Discover and search for "Lutris", then install it.</li>
<li>Run this command in terminal (Konsole):<br/>
<code class="inline-code">flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform.Compat.i386 org.freedesktop.Platform.GL32.default org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default</code><br/>
<em>Which is needed otherwise Lutris throws up an error at you. Use CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste into Konsole with a keyboard.</em></li>
<li>That command will ask a few options, for each one just select the last in the list (the latest). Example:<br/>
<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3371872161650628847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3371872161650628847gol1.jpg"/></a></li>
</ol>
<p>After that, you will have a working Lutris install on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Once it's out properly (which should hopefully be soon), this should end up being just a one-click install like other Flatpak packages in the Discover app.</p>

      <title>Rocket Bot Royale is like a Worms styled Battle Royale with jumping tanks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rocket Bot Royale is a brand new release from developer Winterpixel Games that seems to be what you get if you took Worms, turned it into a Battle Royale and turned everyone into a tank.</p>
<p>It's ridiculously frantic. With both solo and group play, everyone starts off in the helicopter that flies into that map and then just like other BR games, you get to pick where you pop out. Quite hilarious actually and really fast-paced, so games don't last particularly long so it's a great coffee-break game too. Your tanks can climb up walls, rocket-jump and more. It's last tank standing, with a map that gradually gets smaller due to rising water levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E69G82ovrqY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8cfaf503addfc473b5749341face8171.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E69G82ovrqY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even better — it's free to play. There are some micro-transactions but so far it hasn't put them in my face or bothered me at all. I'm not a fan of how you can use coins (which you earn as you play) to power up before a match, which feels a little unfair but I've still managed to take down plenty of others without touching any extras. People who spend real money can get an advantage that way, but since you earn in-game anyway (and reasonably quickly too), it's not the worst I've seen.</p>
<p>The key point is that the game is a lot of fun and worth a look.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748390/Rocket_Bot_Royale/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and works <em>great</em> on a Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Overgrowth from Wolfire Games goes open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like they did with some earlier games, Wolfire Games have now open sourced the game code for Overgrowth. What is it? Overgrowth is a 3D martial arts action-adventure featuring giant rabbits — jump, kick, throw, and slash your way to victory.</p>
<p>You will still need to own a copy of the game, as the open source release does not include the data files, which is a great way for developers to support the open source community (and enable their game to live on forever pretty much) while also continue to earn from it easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uOdjo_Do6hM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67f2fc58d7899a9895201f06ad7d618a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uOdjo_Do6hM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The upcoming Steam Deck Dock got an upgrade, now called a &#39;Docking Station&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At some point, Valve quietly tweaked the specifications for the upcoming official Steam Deck Dock and it's actually better than what they said originally. We still don't even know exactly when it will be out, and they likely want to improve the overall docked experience first as there's quite a few quirks (especially in desktop mode).</p>
<p>Originally, the Steam Deck Dock listed it had 1 x USB-A 3.1 Port and 2 x USB-A 2.0 Ports along with Ethernet. Now though, it states it has 3 x USB-A 3.1 Ports and Gigabit Ethernet.</p>
<p>Seems this was updated in February, when checking the Wayback Machine it shows the text specifications with the original on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220212200007/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech" target="_blank">February 12</a> but then the <em>text</em> was updated sometime around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220222053526/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech" target="_blank">February 22</a> to note the newer ports. Later around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220225193441/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech" target="_blank">February 25</a> the actual <em>image</em> of the Dock was updated to also note it has Gigabit Ethernet too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448537661650611919gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448537661650611919gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Seems Valve are also now calling it a "Docking Station", which was noted around February 22 too.</p>
<p>At least for now, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">this USB-C Hub</a> has been working well enough for me, as noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">in my original review</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-2 out now with many more games playable on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now officially released the latest version of Proton, the Steam Play compatibility tool that allows Windows games to run on the Steam Deck and Linux desktops. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog#70-2" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-2</a> is the new main stable version, not to be confused with Proton Experimental that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/proton-experimental-updated-fixes-resident-evil-revelations-2-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">also updated recently</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the games that are newly playable with Proton:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Atelier Ayesha</li>
<li>Devil May Cry HD Collection</li>
<li>Dragon Quest Builders 2</li>
<li>A Way Out</li>
<li>Fall in Labyrinth</li>
<li>King of Fighters XIII</li>
<li>Montaro</li>
<li>ATRI -My Dear Moments-</li>
<li>Guilty Gear Isuka</li>
<li>INVERSUS Deluxe</li>
<li>Metal Slug 2 and 3 and X</li>
<li>One Shot and One Shot: Fading Memory</li>
<li>Call of Duty Black Ops 3</li>
<li>Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul</li>
<li>Medieval Dynasty</li>
<li>Bright Memory: Infinite</li>
<li>Double Dragon Trilogy</li>
<li>Baseball Stars 2</li>
<li>Elden Ring</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely loads of bug fixes too like Unity games crashing on launch with certain peripherals connected (e.g. Logitech's Unifying Receiver), which is something <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/unity-games-crashing-with-proton-on-linux-or-steam-deck-check-your-usb-devices/" target="_blank">I helped to discover</a>.</p>
<p>Video playback is a big ongoing issue as lots of games use patent encumbered video codecs but work continues to get more supported with these now having working videos: Atelier Meruru, Cook-out, DJMAX RESPECT V, Gloomhaven, Haven, Rust, Rustler, The Complex, TOHU, Monster Train, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Car Mechanic Simulator 2021, Nine Sols Demo.</p>
<p>Many other games had bug fixes like: The Last Campfire not starting on the Steam Deck, DiRT Rally 2 and DiRT 4 not being able to connect to the game server, STAR WARS Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy not displaying anything on the Steam Deck, Assassin's Creed Odyssey displaying an unsupported driver warning in the overlay and more.</p>
<p>On top of all that the Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK was updated to version <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.1" target="_blank">1.10.1</a> and VKD3D-Proton to version <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.6" target="_blank">2.6</a>. DXVK-nvapi (an NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK) was updated to version <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.5.3" target="_blank">0.5.3</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see such big updates to Proton but the work never stops, as keeping up with Windows compatibility is something that will need to continue to be updated for a long time. For games that Valve has run through Deck Verified, they pick either the Native Linux version or the version of Proton needed for it to work. For games not yet tested by Valve, it will default to Proton 7 (until a later Proton release becomes the main stable version) but you can set whatever you want and you can see how in <a href="https://youtu.be/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">our guide video</a>.</p>
<p><em>It will come down as a normal update in Steam like anything else.</em></p>

<p>Valve recently put up a new version of Proton Experimental, the compatibility layer that runs Windows games on Linux and the Steam Deck handheld. Proton has a few stable versions like Proton 7 and Proton 6.3 but Experimental brings in changes quicker than need a little more time testing.</p>

<ul>
<li>One Shot</li>
<li>One Shot: Fading Memory</li>
<li>Age of Chivalry</li>
<li>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li>
<li>Saviors of Sapphire Wings / Stranger of Sword City Revisited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes include a fix for Resident Evil Revelations 2 not starting on the Steam Deck, Wine Mono (a replacement for the .NET Framework) was upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-7.2.0" target="_blank">version 7.2.0</a> and dxvk-nvapi (NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK) to <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.5.4" target="_blank">version 0.5.4</a> for a small bug fix.

      <title>The gorgeous looking Lila&#39;s Sky Ark is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monolith of Minds and Graffiti Games have today launched Lila's Sky Ark, a feast for the eyes if you love pixel-art. The second game from Monolith of Minds, acting as a prequel to the first game Resolutiion.</p>
<p>"Lila’s psychedelic world is in grave danger. Help her and her eccentric friends stop the Conductor’s minions from destroying all things musical and magical in this meditative action-adventure game. Explore this dark yet groovy world as you unravel the poetic mystery that is Lila’s story. Discover secrets, solve puzzles, and battle bizarre beasts and punishing bosses as you attempt to unite the Spirits and save the mysterious Sky Island from ruin."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0T5QEnMAk_Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ab1ecc86341412f2b0a55e9cd78a87a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0T5QEnMAk_Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore Lila's pyschedlic world and get to know her quirky cast of friends, such as the fantastically bespectacled Doctor-Father-Sir and the raven shopkeepers.</li>
<li>Search this groovy dreamscape for hidden secrets, recipes, and even new glasses for a certain Sir.</li>
<li>Unravel Lila's puzzle-like story, which explores themes such as loss, loneliness, grief, and depression, in this moving prequel to Resolutiion.</li>
<li>Battle music-inspired enemies and punishing bosses using an array of strange weapons unlocked through alchemy recipes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks just as peculiar as Resolutiion, and that's a good thing. I really adore this colourful graphical style too, it's very much like Resolutiion but a lot more bright and welcoming looking overall but it sounds like the story goes down some interesting holes.</p>

      <title>Euro Truck Simulator 2 gets a new modern trailer and a fresh Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software are showing off all the advancements made to Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, with a brand new video to showcase it. Plus, there's a new Beta available.</p>
<p>Their last proper trailer was back in 2012, and with how many huge upgrades they've given the game it was of course very much overdue for a proper trailer to show it off. It's not just that though, the game is approaching 10 years old (yes, really!) and so it's a good way to mark the occasion:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5uvwfskYwl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d6b6e05eb07732940aff857c4fc81ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5uvwfskYwl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>They're also teasing something very special for the upcoming 10th anniversary of the trucking sim.</em></p>
<p>On top of that, Euro Truck Simulator 2 version 1.44 is now in <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/04/euro-truck-simulator-2-144-open-beta.html" target="_blank">Open Beta</a> for owners of the game to try out the latest upcoming changes. This new build includes an Austria Rework, Companies Logos Revision, a Mod Refund Feature for those who play the Convoy mode, an Accurate Mileage System for road signs, Unmarked Roads Exploration with advisor notifications, an upgrade to Force Feedback and more. SCS truly showing how much they love their own game to keep pumping out free upgrades like this.</p>
<p>You can buy ETS2 from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/euro-truck-simulator-2?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Framework Laptop Mainboard is out as a standalone platform</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite interesting. Framework Computer, the company that builds the fab modular Framework Laptop has announced the release of the <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/mainboard-availability-and-open-source-release" target="_blank">Framework Laptop Mainboard</a>.</p>
<p>This is available for USA and Canada with a release upcoming for the UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, and Ireland sometime "soon". What's really fun though, is that they say it was designed in a way that you can simply use the mainboard as a standalone single-board computing platform. As they say "All you need to do is insert memory, plug in a USB-C power adapter, and hit the tiny power button on-board, and you’ve got a powered-up computer".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3382870071650555319gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Mainboard" target="_blank">also released</a> the CAD files and electrical documentation under Creative Commons licensing, to encourage people to do whatever they want with it and they also released two 3D printable reference designs to go with it. Going even further, they're opening up a developer program to give away 100 i5-1135G7 Mainboards.</p>
<p>Additionally, they're trying to improve the Linux situation for their hardware too. While it already works quite well, they're going above and beyond what most other traditional vendors do. They've launched a <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/linux" target="_blank">dedicated Linux page</a>, to show off how it works across different distributions and to give more info.</p>
<p>Really liking what they're doing.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For Canonical fans, the latest release of <a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> is now available with Ubuntu "Jammy Jellyfish" 22.04 LTS (Long-term support). Not only is it a carefully tailored GNOME experience for normal desktops, but this also marks the first LTS for Ubuntu to come with support for the Raspberry Pi 4.</p>
<p>"With Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, the entire recent Raspberry Pi device portfolio is supported for the very first time, from the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to the Raspberry Pi 4", said Eben Upton, CEO of Raspberry Pi Trading. "It’s great to see a certified Ubuntu Desktop release that includes support for the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4, giving developers all over the world access to the most affordable development desktop environment."</p>
<p>That's not their only focus of course, the main desktop saw plenty of upgrades with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gnome-42-released-with-the-new-global-dark-style-preference/" target="_blank">GNOME 42</a> (that alone has lots new), ten different accent colours for a little customization, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/linux-kernel-515-released-futex2-work-to-help-linux-gaming-going-into-kernel-516/" target="_blank">Linux Kernel 5.15</a>, OpenSSL 3.0 and a whole lot more. A controversial change, to some, is that Firefox is now only provided in Ubuntu as a snap, that's directly maintained by Mozilla.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17797659471650554212gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17797659471650554212gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 22.04</em></p>
<p>On top of that, they've swapped the desktop icons around to be in the bottom right by default but there's a new Appearance setting to adjust that. You can also change some more settings for the sidebar Dock, plus they said the Dock devices and file manager integration has also been improved.</p>
<p>"Our mission is to be a secure, reliable and consistent open-source platform - everywhere", said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical. "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS unlocks innovation for industries with demanding infrastructure security requirements, such as telecommunications and industrial automation, underpinning their digital transformation."</p>

      <title>GOG do a few more upgrades, this time adding 170 game tags</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finding games on <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> seems like it's steadily getting easier, with another update to their store out now.</p>
<p>After suffering losses, GOG continue to try and bring customers back to their store with a few tweaks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gog-update-their-stance-on-drm-free-galaxy-as-optional-for-single-player/" target="_blank">what they will allow</a> on the store and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gog-attempt-to-bring-customers-back-with-a-revival-of-good-old-games/" target="_blank">revival of Good Old Games</a> — they've been improving how people search for and actually find games. This latest update is a continuation of that.</p>
<p>What they've <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/store_update_170_new_tags_to_help_you_with_more_accurate_catalog_browsing_and_filtering" target="_blank">done now</a> is expand store filtering with 170 new tags for games. The way they've done it seems slightly different to Steam, which bundles tags and genres into the same thing. GOG on the other hand seem to have separated them like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games/adventure" target="_blank">Adventure</a> having it's own section but <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?tags=point-and-click" target="_blank">Point&amp;Click</a> just being a searchable tag. Game pages will have them, and you will be able to search using these tags now too.</p>
<p>It's not a feature that's going to blow your mind but it's definitely helpful as GOG continues building up a larger selection of games to pick from. As we all know from Steam, discovering what you want to buy is a big issue.</p>
<p>Also, you can get Postal 2 free on <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> for 48 hours. Scroll down the homepage to find the banner.</p>

      <title>2013 classic Proteus gets an update for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proteus, a relaxing casual exploration game from Ed Key and David Kanaga (with porting by Ethan Lee) was recently upgraded for Linux and the Steam Deck due to some graphical problems.</p>
<p>The Windows and macOS versions were untouched, as the Linux version had a "severe performance regression". The cause was an issue with "OpenGL call lists" that affected AMD GPU drivers (NVIDIA was fine). Apart from that a few of the techy bits behind the scenes were updated like MonoKickstart and SDL2, with 32-bit also being dropped from the main game (although available as a "linux32" Beta.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rpkpuoq6y9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f502dc1a857a658141074043eadc31b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rpkpuoq6y9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this update it should now work well on the Steam Deck and Linux desktops / laptops with AMD GPUs. One issues remains though that users with XWayland and a high-DPI mode will see a black screen but you can use "SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland" to get around it for now.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/proteus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219680/Proteus/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Funny run and gun game Mighty Goose gets a free upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Run and gun like the classics in Mighty Goose, which just got a little bit bigger with a free update out now. See my previous thoughts about the game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/mighty-goose-is-a-furious-over-the-top-honking-good-time-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank">in this article</a>. Seems it's done quite well, with it now having a Very Positive rating on Steam although that's from less than 500 users.</p>
<p>"Waddle back in action as Mighty Goose travels to the aquatic planet Ceto to deal with the Evil Baron. Fight enemies on a surfboard, commandeer a new aquatic assault vehicle, and reunite with companions like Regular Duck and Commander Vark. Square off with the malevolent tyrant in a devilish boss fight and save Planet Ceto."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TWcGcWtGlHM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd72ff55f772ee5510e5f5e1d583ce60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TWcGcWtGlHM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the initial release issues with the game were thankfully solved, like the most annoying being enemy projectile colour being the same as yours. Since then though, the developer has made them render above yours and they colour-cycle, so it's much clearer. It was a huge amount of fun to play but now it's much better.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299360/Mighty_Goose/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Mighty Goose on Steam</a>. Honk.</p>

Otherwise, they’ll have to wait for the next train - and be frustrated, nobody likes to miss the train.     </li>
<li>New tracks - Click and drag to create tracks that connect your stations. Tracks will be elevated allowing your rovers and drones to pass underneath together with power cables, while pipes can cross over them.     </li>
<li>Same train, different cargo - Traveling on the red planet has never been safer (and efficient!). Trains will have 2 wagons to transport colonists and resources at the same time. Don't worry: they'll travel on the same track with no risk of collision. Build your trains in the stations, assign them to the connected tracks and watch them go.</li>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wobbly Life, an open world physics based sandbox that looks like a lot of fun recently had a huge update and with it comes Steam Deck support.</p>

A good one to have a laugh with and it seems quite popular too, with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over five thousand users. It already worked quite well on Linux with Proton but now it should be a nicer experience directly on a Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Introversion classic Darwinia gets remastered with better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Darwinia was originally released back in 2005, and now Introversion Software has done a massive remaster.</p>
<p>What is it? Darwinia combines together fast-paced action with strategic battle planning. It features a novel and intuitive control mechanism, a graphical style ripped from 80's retro classics like Tron and Defender, and a story concerning a tribe of nomadic sprites trapped in a modern 3D world.</p>
<p>"Fully re-mastered in 2022 to celebrate the Darwinian's 10000 anniversary this updated version brings an undisputed indie classic bang up to date. Running seamlessly on all modern systems, the game hasn't aged a day and is a fresh and relevant now as it was when it first dropped. Winning 3 out of 5 prizes at the IGF including the Seamous McNally Grand prize for Best Independent Video Game and multiple editors' choice awards, now is the time to play one of the most critically acclaimed indie games of all time."</p>
<p>The developers have rewritten the graphics engine and it now supports OpenGL 3.3 core, Direct3D 11, Metal, or Vulkan thanks to <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/main/README.md" target="_blank">ANGLE</a>. Other big changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All the in-game UI now scales more appropriately with the size and DPI of the monitor it's running on</li>
<li>Support for anti-aliasing modes including MSAA, SSAA, SMAA, and FXAA</li>
<li>Support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 (FSR)</li>
<li>Support for anisotropic texture filtering</li>
<li>Higher fidelity colors and tonemapping</li>
</ul>

      <title>Erik Wolpaw to Valve on Portal 3 — &#39;we should just do it&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Erik Wolpaw, a writer on the likes of Half-Life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Half-Life: Alyx and more thinks Valve really should just go ahead and make Portal 3 already.</p>
<p>Wolpaw recently spoke on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkVD94yAmA" target="_blank">KIWI TALKZ podcast</a> on various topics, and had some pretty firm words to give to Valve on getting moving making games again. Some of what Wolpaw said during it included: "I would love to work on Portal 3 in a second, but I can't do it unfortunately by myself. <small>[…]</small> The problem is with 300 employees and I don't know exactly the breakdown, like how many of them are on the production side versus Steam business side versus legal versus whatever, there's a lot of opportunity cost taking 75 people and trying to get a game made.". The conversation goes on to point out employees are always doing something, so they would be pulled from something else of course.</p>
<p>In the end, Wolpaw mentions "We gotta start Portal 3, that's my message to whoever, anything you can do let's just do it, let's just make it happen. I am not getting any younger, we are reaching the point where it's crazy to think literally gonna be too old to work on Portal 3. So we should just do it and Desk Job is fun, if you liked Desk Job send mail to Gabe and tell him you want some Portal 3.".</p>

      <title>Game manager Lutris continues Flatpak improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not quite ready yet, proper support for Flatpak is coming for <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> which will make it work easily on the Steam Deck and a <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.10.1" target="_blank">new update</a> is out now.</p>
<p>For those who haven't used it: Lutris is an app that allows you to have one place to launch all your games from on Linux. This includes Steam, GOG, Origin, Ubisoft, Emulators and more. Regardless of them being Native Linux titles, Windows games run through Wine and more.</p>
<p>Version 0.5.10.1 is a smaller update than usual, as this is mainly fixing up issues from the previous release while also improving Flatpak support. Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Check for Steam executable in home folder for Flatpak</li>
<li>Adjust the Steam, application and desktop shortcuts to launch with<br/>
	Flatpak when necessary</li>
<li>Disable local (XDG) service in Flatpak</li>
<li>Simplify MangoHUD option (now an On/Off toggle)</li>
<li>Remove ability for Lutris to quit Steam</li>
<li>Don't default to fsync on older kernels</li>
<li>Default to a base resolution when Lutris is unable to read the current<br/>
	configuration</li>
<li>Fix issue with .NET 4.8 installation which affects the FF XIV launcher</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Update out, plus Valve dev clarifies a tweak for Gaming Mode (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of official Steam Deck news to cover this morning, as there's a new small Steam Deck Client Update out plus we now know what special performance tweak is done in Gaming Mode compared with Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>For the Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3220645457134651321" target="_blank">update</a>, here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Great on Deck carousels to the Recommended tab of Deck Home</li>
<li>Added deadzone visualizer to the Controller Configurator</li>
<li>Fixed focus issues when entering the Library, and when going into and out of Collections</li>
<li>Further performance improvements for users with very large Steam accounts</li>
<li>Fixed focus display issue with selecting friends in the Invite Friends to Game dialog after entering in some text to filter the list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, for a while we've known there's some difference in expected performance between Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode. I tried to get clarification on what exactly the difference was two weeks ago but Valve didn't reply. Now though, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais decided to explain it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1516286672073228291" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" dir="auto" id="id__bcxn1fxxa7n" lang="en">There's no difference in actual available CPU resources between game mode and desktop mode, but game mode has a tweak to expose the CPU as 8c/8t instead of 4c/8t. This lets several games pick 6 or 8 threads instead of 4, yielding big gains from SMT scaling.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like an interesting way to get a little more juice.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: an additional Steam Deck fix was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220645457137629092" target="_blank">released</a> later noting it "Fixed Home screen loading issue when in offline mode".</p>

      <title>Looks like the Steam Deck will get Refresh Rate Switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue to cook up plans for more exciting upgrades to the Steam Deck, with Refresh Rate Switching looking like it's on the way. Not ready quite yet with work to do but the idea is great.</p>
<p>In response to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZImJANp_-k" target="_blank">video</a> from YouTuber The Phawx who made it work on Windows, Valve developer said <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1516140319443619842" target="_blank">this</a> on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been really excited to bring refresh rate switching to Deck to deliver smooth frame pacing in arbitrary FPS limit scenarios, but the current screen blanking time when switching is a bit much. We've been doing work behind the scenes to improve it, coming soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having the ability to force the Steam Deck screen to a specific refresh rate is going to come with plenty of benefits for so many games that can't hit 60FPS on the Steam Deck. Really, for battery life anyway, you will <em>want</em> to run lower than that a lot of the time for tons of games.</p>
<p>The point isn't <em>just</em> battery life of course, which is a big concern, but how smooth games look and feel overall and being able to lock the panel a bit lower could make all the difference. Looking forward to seeing what Valve come up with, and it will likely be as easy as flicking a switch like the current FPS limiter on Deck.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck just keeps on getting better!</p>

      <title>Steam Deck was the Steam top seller for the week ending April 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more supporting evidence towards the Steam Deck being a nice success for Valve, with <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1515708930344824836" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> reporting that the Steam Deck was the #1 top seller last week.</p>
<p>Their list goes by revenue, so it's not a huge surprise considering the price of the Steam Deck, however it's going up against the likes of Elden Ring which has sold over ten million copies (and lots of those were on PC), as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23027375/steam-deck-sales-numbers-figures-best-selling" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reported. Not only that though, it's <em>also</em> fighting the Valve Index, which is in the top 10 for last week as well and costs quite a bit more — so it really is a show of early strength for Valve's newest hardware.</p>
<p>Maybe 2022 really is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/2022-is-officially-the-year-of-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">officially the Year of Linux Gaming</a>. The key point of that though (that some across the net missed from my take), is that it doesn't mean it's going to suddenly take over, it just means it's at a stage where it really is good.</p>
<p>I also did a quick-take video on how it's doing across the weekend in case you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WM_aKwJNErw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99cd998e6d9943168ed7e5eacdf72ec7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WM_aKwJNErw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's another mildly amusing point I saw come up recently like "Am I the only one hoping that Valve releases a more TV-centric version of the Steam Deck?" on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/am-i-the-only-one-hoping-that-valve-releases-a-more-tv-centric-version-of-the-steam-deck.572332/" target="_blank">Resetera</a> that I saw pop up on Twitter. People sure do forget quickly huh? That <em>was</em> the Steam Machines. However, the Steam Deck clearly has a market waiting for it but I bring this up for another reason — Valve has solved so many of the problems that plagued the Steam Machines that caused their failure.</p>
<p>Especially with the newer Deck interface, Proton, how far Steam has come as a platform with many more features and the list of improvements just goes on. If in a few years they made another attempt, it might not go as badly as some think. What do you think though? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Wine manager app Bottles adds a new Library mode, vkBasalt support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles continues to mature as a way to manage installing applications and games with the compatibility layer Wine. A fresh release is out now showing off some UI improvements and new features.</p>
<p>Version 2022.4.14 adds in a new loading screen, as the startup can take a few seconds so it's just a nice bit of initial polishing for the user experience. Another experimental feature also made its way in with the new Library Mode view. The idea with this Library, is to pull together your various programs into one place for easy launching:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12631820391650294561gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12631820391650294561gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Giving you a one-click start and stop, along with letting you know which Bottle it was installed inside. Sounds like it's going to be quite useful. The option to kill all running processes was also moved, and given a warning to prevent users doing it accidentally.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18932681741650294805gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18932681741650294805gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Another fun addition is support for <a href="https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt" target="_blank">vkBasalt</a> (if you have it installed), a Vulkan post-processing layer that can run shaders from Reshade and it has a few options built-in like Contrast Adaptive Sharpening, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing, Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing, Denoised Luma Sharpening and a 3D colour LookUp Table.</p>
<p>Bottles has quickly become my go-to way for installing things with Wine.</p>
<p>All that and more in the <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.4.14/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.

      <title>box86 and box64 get Steam Play Proton working much better on Arm devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you planning to do some gaming on Arm devices? You need to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86" target="_blank">box86</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64" target="_blank">box64</a> projects, which are really quite impressive. Since the majority of software (especially games) are built for x86 processors (the usual Intel / AMD crop), Arm needs something stuck in between to get them running and that's exactly what these projects do.</p>
<p>Split across 32bit and 64bit, box86 and box64 both recently had major updates and a fun highlight on both is that the developer noted they have plenty of fixes and improvements to get both Steam and Steam Play Proton working — so Linux gaming on Arm is about to see a nice boost with these.</p>
<p>It's a good way to try out some more gaming on devices like the Raspberry Pi, or other popular tiny computing systems.</p>
<p>Many other improvements came along, see the release notes on both:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/releases/tag/v0.2.6" target="_blank">box86</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/releases/tag/v0.1.8" target="_blank">box64</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At some point soon, I'm definitely going to need to see how well it runs on my own RPi4. Sounds like it's getting quite exciting!</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive goes Multicellular in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Multicellular evolution has begun, for the open source game Thrive that is. Currently in Early Access, it continues to show off an impressive design.</p>
<p>With version 0.5.8 the first big addition is a prototype of the Multicellular Stage. For this, once you've gained the nucleus and binding agents, you will be able to jump onto the next stage of life. As it's in the early stages of development though, it's somewhat limited with only the Budding reproductive method available right now. Before this part of the game is fully sorted, they continue working on the microbe stage. The other big addition is signalling agents, enabling you to communicate with allied cells which opens up the game even more.</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.6.1 adds support for the Heroic Launcher Flatpak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt gives you an incredibly easy way to install compatibility layers on Linux like GE-Proton (formerly Proton GE), Lutris-Wine, Luxtorpeda and more.</p>
<p>The developer just recently put up version 2.6.1, which as a bit of a highlight should now work nicely with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heroic-games-launcher-now-on-flathub-even-easier-to-run-epic-games-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Flatpak version of the Heroic Games Launcher</a> (for the Epic Games Store). This is especially good for the Steam Deck, where I imagine most people will be using the Flatpak, since it's easy to install and update via the Discover software centre.</p>

      <title>2022 is officially the Year of Linux Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's it, I'm done, finished. It's "mission complete" now is it not? 2022 is officially the Year of Linux Gaming. Yup, that's something I am now proclaiming and I'm also putting a flag down into February 25 (the Steam Deck release date) as Linux Gaming Day every year.</p>
<p>While the long-running joke of "Year of the Linux Desktop" might take forever to actually be a thing, Linux Gaming is now a lot more mainstream. Thanks largely to Valve of course bringing over Steam to Linux, and eventually producing the Steam Deck — putting the power of Linux and open source literally into peoples' hands.</p>
<p>Of course that's not to say it's all Valve. There's a massively <em>long</em> list of open source contributors who have helped to make this happen. From drivers to desktop environment upgrades there's so many different people, companies and organisations to thank. We wouldn't see the Steam Deck without open source and without the Vulkan API. I've said for years that we needed "hardware, hardware, hardware" with more vendors to properly jump in. It's not enough to have good marketing, or a good desktop, people needed a reason to use it to actually sway them over and clearly the Steam Deck is doing wonders.</p>
<p>If you follow the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, you'll see a lot of people trying out (and actually enjoying) the KDE Plasma desktop mode on the Steam Deck too. Plenty of the fixes coming into KDE Plasma are as a result of people trying it out too, and finding issues, which then benefits all users. You only have to look at the regular <a href="https://pointieststick.com/category/this-week-in-kde/" target="_blank">This Week in KDE blog posts</a> from developer Nate Graham to see how much effort goes into it.</p>
<p>The community building up around it is quite fantastic too, we've already seen a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-plugin-loader-gets-another-release-should-work-better-now/" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a> come along which will be fun to see progress. We've seen multiple emulation tools appear like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/emudeck-makes-emulation-on-steam-deck-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/retrodeck-is-another-solution-for-emulation-gaming-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a>, masses of developers moving to improve their games to add in gamepad support and better text sizing and the list goes on.</p>
<p>There's been times recently it felt like I woke up in a different world, when sites like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-soulless-windows/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> told people to stick with SteamOS and not Windows and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNt_ReLwk40" target="_blank">LinusTT</a> thought SteamOS did better overall. Never did I ever expect things like that to happen. Heck, even Jeff Grubb from Venture Beat said this in a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1513402150952468480" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" dir="auto" id="id__9k0i6f0gyvq" lang="en">Steam Deck makes me want to puke from thinking about how stifled everything is by walled gardens. The community has already made Steam Deck so much better, and it all works together because it's open source. A better world isn't just possible; it exists.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck, Linux and open source are finally starting to get through the cracks — it's incredible. After writing about it for so long, this really does feel like the "what a time to be alive" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu32fBkiHFE" target="_blank">clip</a> that came from The Simpsons and is now a fun meme for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Heck, you even have Microsoft of all companies jumping in to repeatedly talk about their games on this Linux handheld, and even doing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">guide to get Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> to work. It might not be Game Pass on Steam (yet?), but who had any of that on their bingo card? I sure didn't.</p>
<p>More companies are even now looking to go with Linux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">like OneXPlayer</a> because it's showing its worth, something sadly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">GPD don't see</a>.</p>
<p>Even Epic Games are doing a little like making sure Easy Anti-Cheat can work easily on Linux, and getting Unreal Engine into a better state for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/unreal-engine-5-has-officially-launched-lots-of-linux-and-vulkan-improvements/" target="_blank">Linux with Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is heavily focused on the Steam Deck, but you need to remember that apart from the Steam Client, practically all of SteamOS is open source software and all improvements go on to benefit Linux Gaming everywhere. I think we're finally starting to hit that turning point for Linux Gaming as a whole thanks to this. Absolutely tons of people are now learning more about it, enjoying it and sticking with it — exactly what we want to see.</p>
<p><em>Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to go sit on my sofa and load up a AAA game on a Linux handheld.</em></p>

<p>This is the first desktop unit from Star Labs, who usually do their own laptops. All of which come with good and tested Linux support and of course this is no different. You can pick between Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro and more with Windows also an option but that will cost extra (+£110 for Windows 10 Home for example).</p>
<p>Tinker to your liking too, as their warranty allows you to take it apart, replace parts, upgrade, use whatever operating system you like all without voiding it.</p>
<p>When will it be available? You can order now, but it won't ship out until approximately "Late June" but they give a 5% discount if you order now. See more on the <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/byte" target="_blank">Star Labs website</a>.</p>

      <title>Online co-op shooter GTFO adds &#39;partial&#39; Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GTFO, the scary online co-op shooter from 10 Chambers recently had another update, and with it the developers claim they added in "partial" support for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is it? "GTFO is an extreme cooperative horror shooter that throws you from gripping suspense to explosive action in a heartbeat. Stealth, strategy, and teamwork are necessary to survive in your deadly, underground prison. Work together or die together" — according to the developer.</p>
<p>A title that already ran reasonably well on Linux desktops with Proton. For the Steam Deck though it's currently rated as "Playable", and when I quizzed them a little more one of their team said it works better now with the "virtual keyboard, among some other things" as they work to make it Verified. Small steps but certainly better than nothing.</p>
<p>In my own testing though, it's a little problematic. My first attempt hard-locked the entire Deck while dropping down into the level, forcing me to do a full reset of the unit. Then it crashed to the Deck Library when opening a terminal in the next game. A third attempt got it working properly, although performance on the defaults is pretty low but you can adjust plenty to get it into a reasonable state. Apart from that, needing to manually type commands on a few terminals is not great on the Steam Deck and it doesn't show any gamepad glyphs (which is correctly noted by Valve). You also need to manually assign the ESC key to a button on the Deck, to be able to properly exit terminals (it's not added by default).</p>
<p>Considering how unstable I found it to be, plus the other issues, a game I don't think right now deserves to be labelled as Playable.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a few minutes to show some of it running on the Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Valve updates Portal to improve Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve sure do give a lot of love to their games (okay, most, I hear the rumbling of TF2 fans in the background) and a new update has rolled out for the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/" target="_blank">Portal</a> to help the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Portal is one of the titles that Valve updated with <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, which allows the classic to run using Vulkan instead of OpenGL, an update for this title I somehow missed from back in late February. They did the same for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/portal-2-from-valve-gets-a-big-update-with-vulkan-support-from-dxvk/" target="_blank">Portal 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/left-4-dead-2-updated-with-vulkan-support-thanks-to-dxvk/" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/half-life-2-and-the-episodes-get-a-beta-with-vulkan-dxvk-and-more/" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> series. The problem with DXVK for both Native Linux titles and Windows games in Proton, is that it can stutter while it builds up a shader cache.</p>
<p>The new update for Portal lists that it "Added DXVK cache priming for the Steam Deck", which should reduce any stuttering to a minimum for Steam Deck. You can use DXVK to get Vulkan on a Linux desktop too if you run "-vulkan" as a launch option.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love programming? How about real-time strategy games? Check out the new Native Linux release of Screeps: Arena. This is the second game in the series, with the first being Screeps: World that was released back in 2016 and gained a positive rating (and still has players too).</p>
<p>While Screeps: World was a persistent MMO, Screeps: Arena brings things down to be more like a traditional RTS that might end up appealing to a much wider variety of players. It's online only and PvP, where your scripts fight off against others autonomously. Actually sounds quite fun, if you enjoying writing a few lines first.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LkXuGcrCZtU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90c2798908adf29c08a9b0fb70e52278.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LkXuGcrCZtU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the features available include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All aspects of an RTS game: gathering resources, base building, creating and upgrading units.</li>
<li>You don't control your units directly, you play by writing full-fledged JavaScript that runs on game servers.</li>
<li>Other languages are supported via WebAssembly: C/C++, Rust, TypeScript, Go, C#, F#, Kotlin, Swift, D, Pascal, Zig, the list is growing.</li>
<li>Your code is executed autonomously while fighting other players' code during series of short fast-paced 1x1 matchups.</li>
<li>The system will match equal opponents based on your arena rating that changes with every rating game.</li>
<li>You can find an equal opponent instantly 24/7 even if no other players are online, since their saved code is used instead.</li>
<li>Different "arenas" (multiplayer game modes) each with its own rules set and goals covering many aspects of a strategy game.</li>
<li>Only basic programming skills are required. However, if you are a pro developer, now is the chance to put your skills to the limit!</li>
<li>We will introduce new arenas every season so that you always have to write new code for different challenges.</li>
<li>Earn daily fame, gain resources and craft items to unlock more content during the season.</li>
<li>Play with friends and design your own challenges and arenas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1137320/Screeps_Arena/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> in Early Access, there's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Play Worms 2 on Linux with the Worms 2 Plus patch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Worms, a game I grew up with playing on the Amiga, it's an absolute classic and some modern versions just don't have the same charm. Thankfully, Worms 2 can be played easily on Linux (and Windows) thanks to Worms 2 Plus.</p>
<p>Originally released back in 1997, it's obviously quite <em>dated</em> now. Getting it running on modern systems can be quite a hassle but that's where Worms 2 Plus comes in. The developer emailed in about it, as they've made sure that it nicely works with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> too and the installer "automatically configures the game for Wine" they tell me, and this is a perfect way for Wine to shine.</p>
<p>There's a lot that Worms 2 Plus does like applying the last official patch, adds a Borderless Windowed mode, fixes various sound issues, online play without extra configuration, LAN play restored, server list is fixed, plus various other enhancements from other patches. Heck, even <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011449998-Worms-2-modern-systems-fix?product=gog" target="_blank">GOG suggest</a> people to use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5951793071649945116gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>So, if like me, you're a bit of an old-school Worms fan, try it out and see what you think.</p>
<p>You can grab Worms 2 Plus from <a href="https://github.com/Carlmundo/W2-Plus" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and Worms 2 from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/worms_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Soldat 2 gets completely overhauled in a new update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you remember the classic multiplayer shooter Soldat? Well, it continues living on with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/classic-multiplayer-action-game-soldat-is-now-open-source/" target="_blank">original now being open source</a> and the sequel just got completely remade.</p>
<p>Soldat 2 entered Early Access in September 2020 but it seems it didn't quite hit the marks players wanted, and failed to find much of an audience. Transhuman Design never gave up on it, and as it turned out they were hard at work to overhaul everything. This huge revamp is out now!</p>
<p>The movement system was changed to include new abilities like front-flips, hardrolls and glide rolls, sliding and more. Maps were redone, there's a whole new lobby system with lots of modifiers available, the UI was completely remade, there's now an End Results screen with match statistics, matchmaking, a new level editor and the list just goes on. Clearly, a lot of work was put into this. See the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Yes, the Steam Deck will eventually get Ray Tracing, once the AMD GPU driver matures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about Ray Tracing and the Steam Deck, especially after the recent Digital Foundry video but there's a few things that need to be cleared up.</p>
<p>As a reminder: the Steam Deck runs Linux, specifically it's SteamOS "Holo" based on Arch Linux. Right now, Ray Tracing <em>is</em> supported on Linux both for Native Linux titles and Windows title through Proton. NVIDIA has supported Native Vulkan Ray Tracing a long time now, and DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) is getting into shape too with VKD3D-Proton (that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan) version 2.5 that was released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/vkd3d-proton-v25-is-out-for-direct3d-12-on-top-of-vulkan-improving-directx-raytracing/" target="_blank">back in October 2021</a> mentioning "DXR 1.0 support is more or less feature complete" and "DXR 1.1 is now experimentally exposed".</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, the issue <em>isn't</em> specifically to do with Proton. The problem is largely the open source AMD GPU driver in Mesa named "RADV", that just isn't ready yet. Our friends at <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> have covered a lot of the bring-up work involved. It works, but it's <em>slow</em> and improvements on it are being done constantly. While there <em>may</em> be some adjustments needed in Proton (which is likely true for NVIDIA too), the key point is the GPU driver on the Steam Deck. You <em>can</em> even enable it per-game <em>right now</em>, by setting this as a launch option: <code class="inline-code">RADV_PERFTEST=rt %command%</code> but again it won't work well. DirectX games likely still need VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr / VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr11 launch options depending on what they use, as noted in the VKD3D-Proton release notes linked above.</p>
<p>Quake II RTX for example runs on the Steam Deck but as you can tell from the screenshot — not well. First is the default OpenGL renderer, second is RTX (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6472646051649931466gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Quake II RTX - OpenGL - Steam Deck" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6472646051649931466gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3974260601649931467gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Quake II RTX - RTX - Steam Deck" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3974260601649931467gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For Control, swapping it to Proton Experimental from the default Proton 7 (<a href="https://youtu.be/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">guide here</a>) and having the launch option set as: <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr RADV_PERFTEST=rt %command%</code> enables the Ray Tracing options to be enabled on Steam Deck too. First picture is the default graphics, second is with Ray Tracing turned on Medium:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14510414731649934314gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14510414731649934314gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5051109621649934315gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5051109621649934315gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Eventually, once the RADV driver is in good shape for Ray Tracing performance, I do expect it to work okay on the Steam Deck when Valve pull in the needed driver updates into SteamOS since some of it is already clearly there, just hidden behind that launch option above.</p>
<p>Hopefully that clears it up somewhat as a few other much bigger websites have mentioned things like "RT features cannot be accessed from Linux" (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-steam-deck-vs-next-gen-gaming-is-valves-handheld-truly-future-proof" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) and thinking it's Proton itself that cannot "recognize Steam Deck's RDNA 2 cores" (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/steam-decks-future-proofed-potential-borne-out-by-ray-tracing-tests/" target="_blank">Ars</a> — which was also wrong on Quake II RTX, it's a Native Linux build and doesn't use or need Proton) and whatever else other websites say. Even Digital Foundry were technically incorrect in the video. Really, the point is just to clear up some continuing misconceptions of Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Anyway, the DF video is below if you wish to see:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uhy0v_STh6k?rel=0&amp;start=135"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92d140dddb6cc1b2b4edab0240600177.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uhy0v_STh6k?rel=0&amp;start=135" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Personally, I don't see Ray Tracing as the key to anything when it comes to the future and longevity of the Steam Deck. What we need is more developers taking a look, and optimizing for it directly so that games still look good and play well, considering it's a portable with limits.</p>

      <title>Lumencraft blends top-down shooting, Tower Defense and a destructible environment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft is a brand new release from developer 2Dynamic Games that is going to suck up far too much of my time, and might be a new favourite run blast through on my Steam Deck. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Blending together a Tower Defense game, with a top-down shooter and destructible environments, it has all the makings to be the next indie hit and I get a slight Deep Rock Galactic vibe from it too. Blasting through the tutorial and then some of the first sandbox map, well over an hour vanished in the blink of an eye — that's the kind of game I like to see.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ldgf-iLMxxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493d922b67e640f1d193323e211786bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ldgf-iLMxxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Working great on the Steam Deck right away, although the fonts are a little small in places and the resolution isn't quite what it should be but they're aware of such issues and said they will look to solve both. Despite the issues, it's an awesome top-down game to get into already with a lot to like about it. Drilling around, setting up a base and watching out for holes appearing in front of you for creepy-crawlies to appear from — it looks brilliant.</p>
<p>Made with the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's nice to see more developers pick up FOSS tools and the Early Access release comes with Native Linux support: "With a lot of effort and a set of original algorithms, 2Dynamic Games have transformed the open-source Godot Engine into a completely new tool. This allows every bit of terrain (pixel, as we used to call them) to be destroyed, and maps can be painted as if in a drawing program".</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Defending the underground settlement by direct combat and the use of diversified turrets.</li>
<li>Highly efficient and satisfying digging mechanics.</li>
<li>Explosive weapons. Yes, we have dynamite.</li>
<li>Dynamic lights and pixel-perfect interaction with the fully destructible terrain.</li>
<li>Dread atmosphere created through the impactful sound design and a unique 2Dynamic lighting system.</li>
<li>Realistic simulations. Just look at the lava!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/lumencraft" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713810/Lumencraft/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Google detail more on how Steam on Chrome OS works with Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get more info behind the scenes on how Steam for Chrome OS works? It uses Linux but it's a little bit complicated and Google has put out the <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/bringing-steam-to-chromeos" target="_blank">first in a series</a> of blog posts to talk more about it.</p>
<p>The good news of course for normal Linux desktop fans, is that developers will need to ensure their games work on Linux directly. Either through a Native build, which should work out of the box, or ensuring and testing their Windows builds with Proton. Although, Steam Play Proton is not turned on by default for Chrome OS as there's various issues right now.</p>
<p>How does it work then? Through the magic of virtual machines! Using work they've done in the past with <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/linux" target="_blank">Crostini</a>, an already existing way to run normal Linux apps on Chrome OS and "Chrome OS's own virtual machine monitor (VMM), <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/+/HEAD/README.md" target="_blank">crosvm⁠</a>". They say running Steam and games in a container like this "provides another layer of security above normal Linux systems" that's used for Crostini, Android, and Parallels.</p>
<p>Their system, much like SteamOS for the Steam Deck, is based on Arch Linux which they codenamed "Borealis", and it's automatically kept up to date for you with each Chrome OS release. Keeping it simple, while hiding all the technical parts for users, as they say "we have aimed to make the VM invisible to the user – from both an operational and from a performance perspective". They do this by using "Linux's <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page" target="_blank">KVM⁠</a> hypervisor" and "paravirtualized virtio-based devices instead of emulation" and that to play the latest games they built a Vulkan virtualization driver called "<a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/venus.html" target="_blank">Venus</a>".</p>
<p>Borealis and Crostini differ in a number of ways, while still sharing the core graphics and display pipeline, so applications support Vulkan and OpenGL using Mesa drivers. It uses XWayland, together with "sommelier", which they say is their "proxying Wayland compositor" and then it all moves over to "exo" which is their own Wayland display server. The big difference is user experience with Borealis targeting end users and Crostini for developers, with Borealis enabling one-click installs like Steam. The other big difference is that Borealis is based on Arch Linux, while Crostini is based on Debian.</p>
<p>The way they've configured it sounds a lot like the Steam Deck too, with the VM being read-only while having a separate read-write partition for data and they're shipping newer versions of Mesa than what is usually tagged as a release upstream.</p>
<p>Google said to expect "deep dives" on their Steam integration, their Vulkan virtualization, how to develop games for ChromeOS and much more. We can also expect "new devices, new features, better integration and improved performance".</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky got a huge &#39;Outlaws&#39; update and works well on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No Man's Sky, a Steam Deck Verified title that also works great on Linux desktops with Steam Play Proton recently got another massive free update. Hello Games have well and truly shown how to recover from a rough launch, it's now such a completely different game.</p>
<p>Quite a lot is new with this update adding in the likes of overhauled space combat, a new pirate underworld, a new solar ship class (the first new ship class in a long time), you can hire wingmen, smuggle around naughty goods, there's new and more impressive explosions, pirate raids, frigate fleets that will fly overhead, an overhaul to warp and engine effects of all frigates and freighters, in-atmosphere combat and much more.</p>
<p>Their new trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A2UHduOn5ZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19983b5282df0743fabbfb21f7526ab1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A2UHduOn5ZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Want to see how it can run on a Steam Deck? Good news, I have just the video you need to see after messing around with it for a while. It's interesting, as No Man's Sky was a title a tried quite a few times during <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">my original Steam Deck Review</a>, where it really didn't run well, even after their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/no-mans-sky-sentinel-update-specially-optimised-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck update</a>. Going back to it just recently though? It's like a different world, as it does perform quite a lot better. Still has plenty of frame drops when loading in new bits but it's now actually enjoyable.</p>
<p>Here's quite a few minutes of it:</p>

      <title>Splitgate is getting a new matchmaking system that won&#39;t suck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splitgate is actually a pretty great online FPS but it has a major problem with its matchmaking system, so it's getting a rewrite to suck less.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match" target="_blank">blog post</a> they've noted the problem with the current system is that not only is it slow, it's forgetful. It will reset constantly, and re-queue you as it tries to find a bunch of new people to play with. One of the results of how slow it works, is that you end up playing with more bots than intended as it forces you into a game eventually and the developer is solving this.</p>
<p>With an upcoming update the "entire backend" is being rewritten. 1047 Games say the new system will be much smarter, it will keep you playing with people previously found to be a good match instead of entirely resetting, it's fast and scalable and more configurable.</p>
<p>So when will it release? They expected it to be within a few weeks, although they expect the initial update to be a little of the rocky side (buggy). Sounds like a good plan though, and one that's very much needed to save the game, with a playerbase that has dwindled to only a couple thousand playing at a time from heights of tens of thousands.</p>

      <title>Arx Fatalis open source engine Arx Libertatis gets fixed up for Mesa drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arx Fatalis is an Arkane Studios classic from 2002 that was officially open sourced. This update for <a href="https://arx-libertatis.org/" target="_blank">Arx Libertatis</a> should hopefully make it work even better on the Steam Deck, and Linux desktops using Mesa drivers.</p>
<p>"This critically acclaimed first-person RPG from Arkane Studios takes the player on an amazing journey into the fantasy world of Arx. Arx is wrought with turmoil, brought to the brink of destruction by a violent war. The sun has disappeared from overhead to shroud the world in eternal darkness, forcing communities to begin inhabiting underground mines. But as food and drink becomes scarce, the wars become even more violent as each race – from trolls, goblins, and rat-men, to humans – struggle for survival."</p>
<p>Arx Libertatis 1.2.1 is quite a small patch that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One notable fix is for the "Crisp" Alpha Cutout Anti-Aliasing setting introduce in 1.2 which has been causing performance issues when near fogs or smoke for some players while resulting in crashes for Windows users with Intel graphics. In this release the performance issues have been fixed and the setting has been disabled for OpenGL drivers experiencing crashes.</li>
<li>Linux Steam users with Mesa graphics drivers may have noticed textures being replaced with solid colors once the Steam overlay loads. We have added a workaround to no longer promise the graphics drivers that we are good API-respecting citizens if we detect the Steam overlay so that its naughtyness can go unseen again.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to play it easily on Linux or Steam Deck, one way you could set it up is with the Luxtorpeda tool, which I did a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">guide on that you can see here</a> — it's really easy to do and gives you the best version of the game.</p>
<p>You do need the data files of the original release to play with Arx Libertatis which you can buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/arx_fatalis" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1700/Arx_Fatalis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>War for the Overworld gets a surprise graphics upgrade, also sees a big discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War for the Overworld, a Dungeon Keeper inspired game from 2015 had a huge free upgrade recently bringing some graphical improvements and performance optimizations. Nice to see a developer come back to an older title.</p>
<p>The game for the most part is in maintenance mode but this was something of an experiment for a member of their team, and still quite impressive to just come out with years later. One of the major additions is the inclusion of real-time shadows, which dramatically improves the moody look of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4609868771649847411gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>A few other shadow tweaks were added in, all of which seem to be optional as the more advanced features are quite a bit more taxing on computer resources of course.</p>
<p>On top of that it went through a visual tone overhaul, to give you more of a sense of being underground and they provided some comparison shots on that (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15524460131649847590gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15524460131649847590gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Going even further, some performance optimizations also made their way into the game. The developer said they saw a "significant 41.8% reduction in UI overhead on the main menu" and a "5000% gain in performance" for certain parts of the in-game UI like the unit panel "taking only 0.1ms to render down from 5ms when fully populated".</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/war_for_the_overworld" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/war-for-the-overworld?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230190/War_for_the_Overworld/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's 85% off until April 26.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood adds experimental support for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back 4 Blood, the zombie shooter from Turtle Rock Studios has a <a href="https://back4blood.com/en-us/patch-notes/april-2022-update" target="_blank">fresh update</a> out, and the developer has gotten it working on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>An important note though, is that this is "experimental" right now so there may be other issues. However, I've personally tested it on Steam Deck and it works quite well. You get a chat disconnection message often, and cut-scenes seem to stutter with the official Proton but other than that, it's quite playable and enjoyable on the defaults.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developer Note: We have made an experimental change that we believe will make the game playable on Proton platforms such as the Steam Deck, SteamOS, and Linux. While this is not yet official support and has had limited testing, if you are a player interested in playing on these platforms, you should no longer be prevented from doing so and should join us on our Discord to discuss bugs specific to this platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>What they've done is hook up Easy Anti-Cheat to work properly on Linux with Proton.</em></p>
<p>For a quick look at it on Steam Deck with default settings, have a look at my video below:</p>

      <title>Strategy game &#39;Old World&#39; comes to Steam and GOG on May 19 with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World, a game that was talked up as an alternative to the Civilization series that was previously exclusive to the Epic Games Store, is heading to GOG and Steam on May 19 (although, the Linux build will only be on Steam). When it arrives on the new stores, it will also come with an expansion called Heroes of the Aegean, which will be free for anyone who purchases Old World in the first two weeks after release.</p>
<p>Set in classical antiquity, Old World is a historical 4X turn-based strategy game where players select a historical leader to guide their civilization. Leaders are mortal, and once they die, the dynasty's future depends on their heir.</p>
<p>In regards to a Linux version, I did email the developer back in March but they did not reply. However, it has now been <em>officially</em> confirmed in a press release that a full Linux version will also arrive on May 19. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> The May 19th release of Old World will also bring full Linux support to the game, as well as localization to Japanese, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Russian, German, French, and Spanish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the expansion: Heroes of the Aegean contains six historical scenarios which put players in control of Ancient Greece's most famous generals and leaders, from Leonidas to Alexander the Great. Players can put their own spins on famous historical scenarios such as the Battle of Marathon, the Wars of the Diadochi, and the Battle of Thermopylae.</p>

<p>At release it will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/old_world" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597180/Old_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <strong>Note</strong>: only Steam will have the Linux version.</p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection broke on Linux and Steam Deck, here&#39;s a quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a recent update to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/" target="_blank">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>, Xbox Game Studios included the needed Easy Anti-Cheat file for Linux / Steam Deck to work online but they broke it in the process for some.</p>
<p>It's a very good sign that official support may come, as I pointed out on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1513566840856924161" target="_blank">Twitter</a> but I found that it stopped the game working entirely on both my Fedora Linux desktop and the Steam Deck. Looking around, I'm not alone in this issue. Even when trying to use the mode they included with the game to play without anti-cheat (so you can at least play offline), that doesn't work now either.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a temporary fix so you can continue playing offline until they sort it properly. Here's what you need to do (for Steam Deck, be in Desktop Mode):</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the game in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go to Properties.</li>
<li>Local files on the left tab.</li>
<li>Click Browse.</li>
<li>Find the "easyanticheat" folder, and inside remove "easyanticheat_x64.so" (or the whole folder, both ways work)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you will have it back as before, with the option to load without anti-cheat working once again.</p>
<p>Is this safe? Yes, as you'll be using the built-in option to play without it anyway. If you want to restore it, you can just Verify the files inside of Steam and it will grab them again.</p>

      <title>Linux distro EndeavourOS has the &#39;Apollo&#39; release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EndeavourOS, an Arch Linux-based distribution has a <a href="https://endeavouros.com/news/the-apollo-release-has-landed/" target="_blank">new release out</a> with plenty of upgrades to the install process. It may not be "pure Arch", but it's damn close.</p>
<p>Giving you an easy to use installer in a live environment, that allows you to pick various desktop environments, it's easily one of the nicest distributions out there (if you can handle the regular updates). Unlike Manjaro that holds back updates to do some testing, EndeavourOS uses the plain Arch Linux repositories so you get all the updates when you look for them and whatever configuration Arch has for them — for better or worse. This was my personal choice OS until recently, when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/sorry-arch-its-not-working-out-any-more-and-hello-fedora/" target="_blank">I hopped over to Fedora</a>.</p>

EndeavourOS Xfce - testing it live</em></p>
<p>A whole bunch of what's new is on the installer including a change to their internet check to not rely on GitHub or GitLab, a fix for when Xfce4 and i3 are both selected for installation, community editions now install with their dedicated Display Manager, a re-ordered desktop and package selection process, Firefox should no longer be installed when not chosen, compression is now being applied to the installed files for btrfs installs (instead of after) and more.</p>
<p>For the actual install once done, there's been a few changes there too. FirewallD has been enabled by default, there's a new EOS-quickstart application to help you out, a new NVIDIA installer, adjustments to their helper software repositories and a few other smaller changes.</p>

      <title>Selaco is an FPS inspired by F.E.A.R and a demo is coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To say I am hyped about trying Selaco might be a serious understatement because it looks incredible. A GZDoom powered cross-platform FPS inspired by F.E.A.R and soon a demo will be available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selaco is a brand new original shooter running on GZDoom, featuring thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart AI and a fleshed out story taking place within an immersive game world. It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, the developer put up a refreshed version of their original teaser to show off the current state with an announcement that a demo will be coming to Steam in June. Backers of their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PlaySelaco" target="_blank">Patreon</a> will be getting it a little earlier on April 22. Check out the new teaser below:</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II recreation &#39;fheroes2&#39; gets improved language support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>fheroes2 is easily now the best way to play Heroes of Might and Magic II on any platform, an absolute classic and the project continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Version 0.9.14 was released recently improving the supported languages, like the ability to properly display Norwegian and Italian languages, plus most other translations were also updated. The "Battle Only" button was also fixed across most languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16923649421649678143gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16923649421649678143gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The logic and code for artifacts was also completely reworked, which they said fixes "many places of incorrect effects from artifacts and even missing bonuses", and it now "works exactly as in the original code". With the changes they made, it will even help modding, as it's now "very easy to add new artifacts into the game or modify their abilities opening huge possibilities for modding".</p>
<p>On top of that the AI should be smarter with optimizations done on making decisions for spells, construction and the AI can now use the "Dimension Door". Support for MP3 and FLAC in-game music formats was added, video loading speed was improved dramatically, plus lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21298729251649678148gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21298729251649678148gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and remember to grab the data from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>A developer made a ShadowPlay-like high-performance recording tool for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Find you get too much of a performance hit using other recording tools like OBS Studio? Maybe this new tool will help. It doesn't have a fancy name, just called "<a href="https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/about/" target="_blank">gpu screen recorder</a>" along with <a href="https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder-gtk/about/" target="_blank">GTK front-end</a> you can use to help manage it.</p>
<p>They claim it's the "fastest screen recording tool for Linux". Why make it? Well, in their own words on how it's different to OBS when paired with NVENC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OBS only uses the gpu for video encoding, but the window image that is encoded is sent from the GPU to the CPU and then back to the GPU. These operations are very slow and causes all of the fps drops when using OBS. OBS only uses the GPU efficiently on Windows 10 and Nvidia. This gpu-screen-recorder keeps the window image on the GPU and sends it directly to the video encoding unit on the GPU by using CUDA. This means that CPU usage remains at around 0% when using this screen recorder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their own testing, they said they saw FPS drops from 30 to 7 with OBS Studio at 4K but with their tool they saw a solid 30FPS. This of course highly depends on your CPU but the point here, is that it uses the full power of your GPU, and seeing a performance loss with OBS on Linux is pretty common.</p>
<p>They have a lot of plans for it including support for AMD and Intel GPUs, the ability to dynamically change bitrate / resolution to match desired fps, see the cursor in the recording and more.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great project, that could be helpful for those of you who want high-performance recordings or something more like Nvidia ShadowPlay perhaps.</p>

      <title>Might and Delight come up with a plan to save Book of Travels</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Book of Travels is a tiny multiplayer online RPG from developer Might and Delight (known for the likes of Shelter and Meadow), which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/book-of-travels-did-not-have-a-good-launch-might-and-delight-let-devs-go/" target="_blank">didn't do particularly well</a> at the Early Access release but now they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1152340/view/3227400227403370955" target="_blank">have a plan</a> to save it.</p>
<p>Now the dust has settled on their studio cutbacks, they've outlined a reasonable sounding plan to get Book of Travels into a state where it can be ready for them to continue to produce actual playable content. This includes bringing in "help from old friends with large amounts of experience dealing with situations like ours".</p>
<p>Here's their plan:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For the next 3 months we’ll focus on more large scope tech issues. These won’t be specific bugs or glitches that are typically visible to the player, but more world encompassing system issues that need to be addressed in order for the game as a whole to be more fertile ground for us to start eradicating the comparatively smaller problems that actually are evident to the player.</li>
<li>During this time we may appear to be quiet or seem inactive. This is just because we will be very busy. Since the nature of these larger scale issues don’t always make them suitable for traditional patch notes, you won’t necessarily see a typical flow of those during this period. You will, however, notice the game getting updated in the Steam client, and if an update doesn't come with the traditional patch notes – now you know why.</li>
<li>After this period we’ll resume with the releasing of additional content. By this point we plan to have the game’s foundation solid enough to allow us to start growing it again. We have lots of cool things that we’re dying to get into your hands. The city of Kasa, for instance, is very close to being finished and we know you’re excited for the deeper character customisation tools that we’ve talked about in the past. But this doesn’t mean that we’ll be done with fixes, just that we can start doing both fixes and fun new content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's pretty rare for a developer to admit they've got a lot of problems with their code, especially to go into quiet mode for a while to get it all fixed up. This likely means Book of Travels will fall off the radar even more for players — but hopefully it will be worth it in the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D6UFUUvWzUA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13ed604fafe49a529f450cb22de7baf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D6UFUUvWzUA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Book of Travels has a great idea, and a wonderful visual style but clearly has a lot of issues. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1152340/Book_of_Travels/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Book of Travels on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>OpenRazer 3.3 adds support for more hardware on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://openrazer.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenRazer</a> version 3.3 brings with it support for even more Razer hardware on Linux, along with some other improvements. This is now a rather big collection of drivers, which you can use with various front-ends like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/z3ntu/RazerGenie" target="_blank">RazerGenie</a>.</p>
<p>With this release these are now supported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Razer Orochi V2</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenRazer is an another essential free and open source project, making up for the official vendor not providing full Linux support. Open source is awesome right? Still, a shame it has to be done by the community.</p>

      <title>Valheim gets a bug fix update as work on Mistlands continues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While most players are itching to play through the upcoming Mistlands update, Iron Gate have a small bug-fix and improvement update out for Valheim. From the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/more-teasers-for-a-big-valheim-update-have-arrived/" target="_blank">last update</a> Iron Gate gave on Mistlands, we're still sadly quite a while away from seeing it in-game as there's a lot of work ahead on it.</p>
<p>For now, at least some annoying issues were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3220644827970865344" target="_blank">solved</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where trolls would not get staggered correctly sometimes</li>
<li>Map key legend fixes and remove map icon gamepad mapping set to LB</li>
<li>Various small fixes to Frost Cave rooms</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to pausing after being in debugmode and changing server</li>
<li>Upgrade function will now remember the selected object when upgrading</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the split stack number sometimes would not be visible on high resolutions</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes smelters would not always use the correct amount of coal</li>
<li>Fixed some items not being covered in snow</li>
<li>Hotbar selection marker now more visible on light backgrounds when using gamepad</li>
<li>The ‘resetsharedmap’ console command added and various devcommands improvements</li>
<li>Buying items from the trader on gamepad no longer buys twice, plus some interface tweaks</li>
<li>Keyboard &amp; gamepad hints for inventory screen</li>
<li>Picking up your tombstone will now try to stack items</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where tombstones sometimes would be unreachable in Swamp trees</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I'm just playing other games until the next major update is out but it's a thoroughly enjoyable game to get into even though it's not yet finished. An Early Access game done right for sure.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's Steam Deck Verified. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck Plugin Loader gets another release, should work better now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community-built Steam Deck <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a> continues to mature, with version 1.1.0 out now fixing some issues.</p>
<p>With this installed onto your Steam Deck, you will be able to load it up with whatever Plugins the community can come up with like a classic <a href="https://github.com/SpyrexDE/SDH-BigPictureMode" target="_blank">Big Picture Mode</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/SpyrexDE/SDH-Calculator" target="_blank">Calculator</a>. No doubt plenty more plugins will be appearing over the next few weeks and months once the project improves more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21444655331649673490gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21444655331649673490gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - an example from the Plugin Loader developer</em></p>
<p>Here's what's new in Plugin Loader version 1.1.0</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The loader now automatically reinjects itself into Steam when Steam gets restarted</strong>
<ul>
<li>This means the loader now properly starts up again when switching back from Desktop Mode and also is more reliable when rebooting the Deck</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plugin Tiles are now isolated in their own iframes</li>
<li><strong>Plugins now all live in their own folder</strong>
<ul>
<li>This allows separating python backend code from UI code, bundling extra dependencies and so on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The menu title now gets changed from <code class="inline-code">Plugins</code> to the name of the current Plugin when one gets loaded</li>
<li>Fixed first plugin button being smaller than the rest of them</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely loving seeing all the community additions coming along to the Steam Deck, showing the power of what open source can do without a walled garden.</p>

      <title>Duck Game gets a patch for Proton, now works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Duck Game, an action platformer from Landon Podbielski and Adult Swim Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/312530/view/3228526127310726251" target="_blank">been updated</a> to enable it to work properly with the current version of Proton 7 and gets it working on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With their changes, it should now work out of the box! Released originally on Steam back in 2015, it went onto receive wide recognition with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from 20,944 (at time of writing) user reviews. Always nice to see such a title running well on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A video of it on Steam Deck with no adjustments done:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1wmRFmclqyE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a98d4bdc6915a41442937e07bd0d6817.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1wmRFmclqyE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Updated Steam SDK version<br/>
-Fixed issues with toggling fullscreen in Linux (Proton)<br/>
-Added onscreen keyboard support when playing in big picture mode<br/>
-Duck Game will now automatically detect if it is being run through Proton, the '-linux' command line is no longer necessary. It can still be used incase automatic detection fails, and the '-nolinux' command line option has been added just incase the auto detect returns a false positive in some situations.<br/>
-Usability menu now works through Proton<br/>
-Fixed a number of issues with Mod types loading incorrectly through Proton (Dord's Weapons and any other assembly with weird characters in it's name such as ' will benefit from this)<br/>
-Fixed some rendering issues on Proton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/duck-game?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights in Wine 7.6:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 7.2.0.</li>
<li>More progress on the PE conversion of graphics drivers.</li>
<li>Locale support using the new CLDR-based database.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As we explained previously: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>17 bugs were noted as solved including issues for: The Crew (Uplay), Oculus Runtime, SteelSeries GG installer, Silk Road: Tale of the Star Island, Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and others.</p>

      <title>Godfall Ultimate Edition seems to run well on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godfall Ultimate Edition released onto Steam on April 7, a former Epic Store exclusive, and now thanks to the Steam release it runs very nicely on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>"Aperion is on the precipice of ruin. You are the last of the Valorian knights, god-like warriors able to equip Valorplates, legendary armor sets that transform wielders into unstoppable masters of melee combat. Ascend in Godfall, the first-of-its-kind, looter-slasher, melee action-RPG."</p>
<p>Here's some quick footage of it running on a Steam Deck. The initial intro story cutscene giving a quick bit of history seems out of sync though, although okay at the start during the fight scenes it doesn't match up at all to what's happening and that can be reproduced across Proton 7, Proton Experimental and GE-Proton.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint working on a new upgrade tool for major releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint, the distribution that tries to set itself apart for beginners (but not only) along with their own Cinnamon desktop environment, <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4293" target="_blank">have some plans</a> to help users upgrade.</p>
<p>Jumping between small releases is currently fine, since Linux Mint sticks to the same Ubuntu package base. However, upgrading to a new major version can be a hassle. Thankfully, they're working on solving this issue with a brand new upgrade tool in the works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8462209831649430316gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8462209831649430316gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Compared with the existing upgrade tool these are the main features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It’s fully graphical, no command line.</li>
<li>It’s localized (the existing tool is only in English).</li>
<li>It performs more checks to make sure everything is fine (for instance it checks that you are connected to AC power, free space vs download size, list of removed packages etc..).</li>
<li>It’s configurable (even though you really shouldn’t skip anything, it does allow you to disable some requirements, such as the presence of a Timeshift snapshot).</li>
<li>It preserves your choice of mirrors (it checks to see if they’re compatible, responsive and up to date)</li>
<li>It doesn’t force you to remove your custom repositories and PPAs (it checks whether or not they support the target release though)</li>
<li>It warns but lets you keep orphaned packages (packages which aren’t present in repositories)</li>
<li>It provides and handles solutions (for most detected issues, along with the explanation you’ll just need to click a “Fix” button to solve the issue).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said it's the "number one priority" this current development cycle, and they will be using it for people who jump between the LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) versions 4 and 5 first and then later for Linux Mint 20.3 to Linux Mint 21. It makes sense to use it on the lesser used version to help iron out any kinks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Linux Mint 21 is codenamed "Vanessa" and it will be based on Ubuntu 22.04 and support 3 editions: Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce.</p>
<p><em>Eagle-eyed viewers will also spot a video created by a certain person (me) in the blog post.</em></p>

      <title>War Thunder gets officially Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gaijin Entertainment has updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236390/War_Thunder" target="_blank">War Thunder</a>, and as a result it went through Deck Verified once again to get a fully Verified status for the Steam Deck. This seems to have be done on their Native Linux build too, so they put in some real effort for this.</p>
<p>They didn't say what exactly they changed though, here's their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good news everyone! The War Thunder development team have fully optimized the game for the newest Steam Deck gaming devices that hit the shelves at the end of February. Steam Deck players were able to play War Thunder right from the platform’s release point, but there were still some minor compatibility issues. We did our best to complete optimization, and are proud to announce the full compatibility check mark recently received from the Steam Deck developers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands players worldwide come to play War Thunder daily. Players from various platforms can take command of combat vehicles in one battle: Windows, Mac, PlayStation, Xbox, Linux. Now, a growing audience of Steam Deck owners joins us, who are able to play with their Steam account and easily share the achieved progress between platforms. Welcome aboard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's good news, as one of the more popular games on Steam where the anti-cheat is also supported. War Thunder sees regularly close to 70,000 players online at any one time meaning it's constantly in the top 20 Steam games.</p>
<p>Do you think you'll be playing War Thunder on Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi OS gets some big updates, possible to run experimental Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Raspberry Pi OS has been through a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/" target="_blank">big update</a> recently, which fans of the little devices need to be aware of for future setups and upgrades.</p>
<p>First, in the name of security, the default "pi" user is no more. Why? Well, attacks are on the rise, and since the RPi is incredibly popular, it is obviously a target. Removing the default name is just another small barrier that anyone doing something naughty has to overcome, as they might now need your username directly too. That, and new legislation from some countries that forbid having default login info. Seems like a sane change regardless, so their install wizard (that's now required to use) was upgraded to create a proper user account.</p>
<p>On top of that, hassles of Bluetooth during setup should be a thing of the past. Now, it will tell you to set your devices into pairing mode and sync them up.</p>
<p>As for the future: say hello to Wayland. Everywhere it is beginning to replace X and the Raspberry Pi OS has been making preparations on that front too. They switched to mutter to help with this, and now you can also test out a very experimental version of RPi OS on Wayland (but they don't recommend it yet), with many features not yet hooked up fully or at all. Plenty of it is also running under XWayland, so it's not a "pure" Wayland implementation of the desktop.</p>

      <title>Zink, the OpenGL on top of Vulkan driver gets &#39;Kopper&#39; merged — huge for the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zink is an open source driver layer that gives OpenGL on top of Vulkan, it's been in progress for some time now, steadily making progress. Just recently, a big advancement was pulled in.</p>
<p>It's called "Kopper" (previously "Copper"), which is what allows Zink to talk to your Linux system properly. Thanks to this being merged in, it will provide proper GLX window handling to Vulkan WSI handling. What does this actually mean? Well, developer Mike Blumenkrantz who worked a lot on it mentioned in a <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/big-marge/" target="_blank">blog post</a> these simple points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zink now uses Vulkan WSI and has actual swapchains</li>
<li>Combinations of clunky Mesa environment variables are no longer needed; <code class="inline-code">MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink</code> will work for all drivers</li>
<li>Some things that didn’t used to work now work</li>
<li>Some things that used to work now don’t</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, lots of cases of garbled/flickering rendering (I’m looking at you, Supertuxkart on ANV) will now be perfectly smooth and without issue.</p>
<p>Also there’s no swapinterval control yet, so X11 clients will have no choice but to churn out the maximum amount of FPS possible at all times.</p>
<p>You (probably?) aren’t going to be able to run a compositor on zink just yet, but it’s on the 22.1 TODO list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developer Christian F.K. Schaller <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/04/07/why-is-kopper-and-zink-important-aka-the-future-of-opengl/" target="_blank">explained</a> further on why this is all important for Zink. In short, it means "that you can get full OpenGL support even if your GPU only has a Vulkan driver available and it also means you can for instance run GNOME on top of this stack thanks to the addition of Kopper to Zink".</p>
<p>A massive step for the Zink driver. This is really ending up quite exciting for the future of Linux. Imagine it: driver vendors no longer shipping OpenGL but just Vulkan, with Zink handling the OpenGL side with all the performance and power that comes with Vulkan and any updates to Zink can benefit them all. As Schaller notes, it's all about backwards compatibility and "it will also at some point help reduce the amount of code we need to ship and maintain significantly as we can just rely on Zink and Kopper everywhere which of course reduces the workload for maintainers".</p>
<p>Sounds pretty great to me.</p>

      <title>Sorry Arch (EndeavourOS), it&#39;s not working out any more and hello Fedora</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There comes a time when everyone has to sit and think about what they use on their PC, especially if you're on Linux. For me, Arch Linux (via EndeavourOS) just wasn't working out any more and so I've moved to Fedora.</p>
<p>While I was reasonably happy with Arch Linux, it's just not stable enough for me <em>personally</em>. It's a very subjective thing of course, and highly dependent on what hardware you use — along with how often you update. For me, it just messed things up a bit too often, and last night was the final straw.</p>
<p>I updated either that day, or the day before, and just before a livestream was due to start, my SteelSeries headset no longer worked. No matter what I tried, following guide after guide about PipeWire, nothing helped. Just this weird and very quiet electrical static noise whenever I tried piping audio to it. Eventually it worked again by some downgrading, plus random hotplugging and testing it on a Windows machine for a sanity check and it started somewhat working again. My Microphone was another issue, at the same time it decided to be ridiculously quiet for no apparent reason I could see so there were wider problems. I had <em>enough</em>, I had work to do and after hours of hair-pulling — hello from Fedora.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5511528831649415297gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5511528831649415297gol1.png"/></a>Fedora's KDE Spin</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, with the likes of Flathub / Flatpak packages and how far along apps like Discover have come along for installing packages and setting things up, there's not a whole lot to learn. It's been a very long time since I used Fedora, and it was one of my first Linux distributions I tried sticking with back when it was "Fedora Core" and wow — it's always surprising to see how far we've come as a platform for doing anything.</p>
<p>Fedora does come with some of its own issues, like NVIDIA drivers being a nuisance to install, which they definitely should improve. If other distributions can do one-click or one-line installs, I'm sure they could do it too. However, it's just another point towards me swapping to AMD when prices settle, or perhaps Intel when Arc properly launches for desktop. I also need to figure out why Dropbox won't load on startup, some little things like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, are you really a Linux nerd if you don't distro-hop at least once a year? Jokes aside, I look forward to seeing why people keep recommending Fedora nowadays as a stable distribution, let's see how long it takes me to break it.</p>

      <title>Valve marks the first month of the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220644827954565734" target="_blank">news post</a> going over some of the changes and improvements of the Steam Deck over the first month since the initial release. There's a lot that's been going on, with updates releasing rather regularly. Most of it, we've already gone over in articles you can follow on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a> and videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Some of what's mentioned includes jumping over 2,000 Verified and Playable titles, which is a nice healthy number for such a new system. There's quite a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-gathering-a-list-of-deck-verified-games-that-have-problems/" target="_blank">lot of issues</a> there though, they know this, and so the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">feedback system</a> was introduced to see how different the experience is compared with Deck Verified and what players actually see.</p>
<p>Anti-Cheat is another one, perhaps the <em>biggest</em> mountain the Deck has yet to climb even a little. This is the first time anyone official has actually mentioned Apex Legends, which got <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">officially Deck Verified last month</a>, so that's nice to see. They also noted Elden Ring as another that has Easy Anti-Cheat hooked up. Valve say of course "One of our top priorities is to support as many titles on Steam as possible, and this includes titles that employ anti-cheat technology." but only having two new games to note is just showing how difficult it is to get developers to do it.</p>
<p>There's a few other points that Valve went over, but if you've read much on the Steam Deck from me or others, it will all be old news by now. Like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, many <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-small-update-to-fix-downloads-adds-triggers-for-keyboard/" target="_blank">Keyboard improvements</a>, Windows drivers and so on.</p>
<p>Valve did their own little overview too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OhfZ2exhBhs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25022b8ab9ef2cef5ba4474459b9e665.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OhfZ2exhBhs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall, it's been a fantastic month for the Steam Deck and Linux Gaming as a whole thanks to it and all of Valve's effort in making it a success. They're doing a huge amount right.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a small update to fix Downloads, adds Triggers for Keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again Steam Deck fans, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220644827957420569" target="_blank">another</a> upgrading ready and waiting to be downloaded. This time though, it's a pretty small one with only a few changes. All welcome changes though of course.</p>
<p>Some users noticed recently that downloading on the Steam Deck might cause the Steam Client to freeze. Obviously a pretty major problem and one thankfully Valve has solved quite quickly since the last update.</p>
<p>On top of that, they continue to make using the on-screen Keyboard even better. Only recently they introduced dual trackpad typing, like that found in Big Picture Mode with the Steam Controller that many people missed. Now, they've tweaked it even further. You can use the Left and Right Triggers to select keys and in addition, there's options to adjust the sensitivity of the trackpads which sounds ideal for people to get it exactly where they want it.</p>
<p>My quick look at the Steam Deck Keyboard if you missed it:</p>

      <title>How to give Valve feedback when Steam Deck (Proton) games have issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While this may be something Linux users are used to, players new to the Steam Deck should be aware of how to catch issues for Valve to hopefully fix up Proton.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: for the majority of games on Steam Deck, they won't be Linux Native. Instead, they will rely on the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games on SteamOS which is based on Arch Linux. It's not perfect, there are issues and here's how you can catch them.</p>
<p>If you have a problematic game (yes, even Verified or Playable), here's what to do:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WMjnIKW9f58"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83c2f541a852f1e9043c22051fc48a40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WMjnIKW9f58" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide, here's what to do:</p>
<p><em>You can tell a game on Steam Deck is using Proton in the Game Info tab, below the Compatibility note box.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the game in your Steam Library -&gt; tap the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Go down to Properties</li>
<li>In the General section (the first tab), enter this Launch Option: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_LOG=1 %command%</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now any time you run this game, it will create a log file of everything it's doing with Proton in your <em>home</em> folder. It will be named along the lines of "steam-1672970.log".</p>
<p>Next go to the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues" target="_blank">Proton GitHub Issues page</a>, search for your game and if a post already exists, add your log in a comment and explain what happened. Or, create a new issue, and it will give you a template to fill out.</p>

      <title>Xbox Games Studios talk up more of their games on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still a little weird to see but Xbox Games Studios have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/3090835/view/3106927664829135594" target="_blank">talked about</a> more of their games running on Steam Deck, a system powered by Linux. Not the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/even-xbox-game-studios-are-talking-about-steam-deck-compaitibility/" target="_blank">first time they've done</a> this and likely won't be the last, heck they even showed how to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming running</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Deck Verified</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fable Anniversary</li>
<li>Halo Wars: Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Killer Instinct</li>
<li>Kalimba</li>
<li>Halo: Spartan Strike</li>
<li>RUSH: A Disney - PIXAR Adventure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deck Playable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minecraft Dungeons</li>
<li>Gears Tactics</li>
<li>Deadlight</li>
<li>Halo: Spartan Assault</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a video of how Minecraft Dungeons runs on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9AYyTsgrXwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2aaf56a2e01ec3e9882daa6c0f882b18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9AYyTsgrXwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An important note: while Valve has given Minecraft Dungeons a Playable rating, there's an issue where it can freeze when you complete a mission and get to open a chest. Luckily, reloading still gives you the chest. I've seen this on a Linux Desktop and on Steam Deck. Seems this bug was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5246#issuecomment-1059720840" target="_blank">reported</a> previously.</p>
<p>While no doubt some other reporters will claim Microsoft has suddenly made them compatible or available, let's keep things grounded. Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios here actually did, well, not much really (apart from set some default settings perhaps). All of this is thanks to Valve's work and funding for the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux. Regardless, it's fun to see XGS talk about the Steam Deck in a positive way.</p>

      <title>The Hand of Merlin to get full Native Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Room-C Games working with Croteam have announced that The Hand of Merlin will see full Steam Deck support, as work continues on their Native Linux version.</p>
<p>The Linux version has been available in Beta for a while but they're not quite finished with it to tick the box and have it show on the Steam store. The good news is that they've also been testing on Steam Deck, where it works great, and they think it should get bumped from Playable to Verified when done.</p>
<p>As they stated in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/600610/announcements/detail/3186867830748570723" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First things first, we've already been working on supporting Linux natively. Although we haven't ticked the box to make this official on the store page yet, the native Linux (and macOS) executables have been available for some time now, and a few of our dedicated fans have been helping out with compatibility testing. This means we do not require Proton (a Windows emulation layer) to run our game on SteamOS / Steam Deck. In other words, there's no risk of an emulation layer introducing bugs or instabilities, plus there's zero overhead, which improves both performance and battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the biggest gruntwork was updating our Steam API support from a fairly old version (that came by default in Serious Engine 4) to the newest one required by Steam Deck. This allowed us to correctly identify the input controls: both the touchscreen and the gamepad, and I have to say - planning ahead really helped us out here. With Steam Big Picture mode already supported via our dynamic UI scaling system, font legibility was no issue at all. Having already done full gamepad support, once we updated the Steam API, the controls also Just Worked(TM).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zvPwlH92acc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d6a4a996cddb2aad4fa365a53101dd6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zvPwlH92acc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So at some point we should see a great experience with this on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>RimWorld now includes full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ludeon Studios have updated RimWorld, tweaking lots of areas to improve their support of the Steam Deck. Available previously as a Beta that included some of the changes, it's now available to all players.</p>
<p>The original developer who was working on Steam Deck support was sadly caught up in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Ludeon Studios mentioning they are now safe.</p>
<p>There's quite a <em>lot</em> of changes involved to improve the controls for the Steam Deck and just generally make it work a little better. The gist of the update is that it makes "the Deck controls more intuitive, refines the touchscreen interface, improves the UI and keyboard, and adds an easy way to access the Deck's controller config options".</p>
<p>For those who want to see, here's all those that directly affected Steam Deck and Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Ideology Improvements</div>
- Show accept key command hotkey on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Set new, better SteamDeck menu icons.<br/>
- Larger float menu options on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Keyboard on a SteamDeck now shows automatically when a new text field is focused.<br/>
- Show a special window at the top of the screen which shows the typed in text, since SteamDeck keyboard can sometimes block the text field view.<br/>
- Increase text input font size.<br/>
- Don't show tooltips when the SteamDeck keyboard is open.<br/>
- Change quests SteamDeck icon.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Controls</div>
- Touch screen scrolling improvements on SteamDeck.<br/>
- It's now possible to scroll through lists by dragging your finger on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Make zooming faster on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Holding a special "middle mouse button" button on SteamDeck, now translates left clicks into right clicks. This makes it possible to give goto orders to drafted pawns by using the touch screen.<br/>
- Don't pan the camera if the middle mouse button is held and a colonist is selected on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Allow more zoom on SteamDeck for better touch screen support and easier navigation.<br/>
- Better time controls on SteamDeck, it's now possible to increase/decrease time speed with back buttons.<br/>
- Accept key on a SteamDeck now activates the first command.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Misc Improvements</div>
- Tutorial now mentions the correct button names on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Added triggered modal ConceptDefs which explain SteamDeck controls.<br/>
- Added controller configuration button to options on SteamDeck.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Technical</div>
- Added SteamDeck configuration file.<br/>
- Added SteamInput.<br/>
- Suppress SteamDeck ConceptDef warnings.<br/>
- Updated Steamworks so that it's possible to show the correct on-screen keyboard on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Added "Simulate using Steam Deck" debug setting.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Fixes</div>
<p>- Fix: Mouse position never updates on Linux builds.<br/>
- Fix: Missing EventUp event in MultiPawnGotoController on SteamDeck<br/>
- Fix camera movement on SteamDeck. "Middle mouse button" camera movement on SteamDeck now works as well. This also allows using touch screen to move the camera.<br/>
- Fix: Mouse position never updates on a SteamDeck<br/>
- Fix: Q and E hotkeys shown on a SteamDeck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3133947359554382338" target="_blank">announced</a> previously in early March they would allow developers to add a note to their compatibility rating, and this is the first time I actually saw it in action for RimWorld. This linked to Ludeon Studios' previous blog post about upcoming improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17653910471649320941gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Perhaps now it will see a bump up to Verified status. It will also be interesting to see if they reverify against the Native build, as previously it was rated with Proton.</p>
<p>You can see a previous quick-look I did below:</p>

      <title>Half-Life Alyx: LEVITATION promises another 4-5 hours of VR fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life Alyx: LEVITATION is an impressive looking upcoming mod for Valve's incredible VR experience. Probably one of the best games and gaming experiences, I've ever had. I'm itching to play a whole lot more in this world.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for any mod team to create a comparable experience, especially with the added extras that a VR game mod will need but this really does look promising.</p>
<p>Due to arrive sometime in Q3, a new trailer has been released:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KO2Hu3NynN8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/632ab8f36fcdcea9f790de6ae41081c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KO2Hu3NynN8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Will be great for those who can <em>actually</em> play it on Linux though, as I've been getting the "Timed out waiting for response from Mongoose" error for months now and I've been unable to play it either Native Linux or through Proton. It's <em>incredibly</em> frustrating Valve has left it in this state — with some seeing <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/332" target="_blank">the error</a> since 2020. Other VR games work fine, it only seems to happen to Alyx. Valve, please fix it.</p>

      <title>GOG attempt to bring customers back with a revival of Good Old Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> aren't having the best of times recently, with details about their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">financial troubles</a> painting a bleak picture, although it seems they have something of a plan. Later they announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gog-update-their-stance-on-drm-free-galaxy-as-optional-for-single-player/" target="_blank">some changes</a>, including a tweak to what they mean by DRM free.</p>
<p>Now? They're attempting to go back to their roots, at least little, to woo customers back to their store with a small revival of "Good Old Games", what they were originally known as. The start of this is the addition of a <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1578845458&amp;as=1636858786&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/games?tags=good-old-game" target="_blank">Good Old Games tag</a>, which GOG say will "showcase over 500 games that our Team has deemed iconic classics".</p>
<p>This is one reason I liked GOG originally, their commitment to bringing back and supporting old games, but they lost their way somewhat when trying to become just another store. Hopefully they will be doing more as time goes on to revive old games. Plenty of older games nowadays can run on Linux just fine through all sorts of open source game engines, and having an easy and legal place to get them for the data files is great.</p>
<p>To go along with this announcement, today they released the classic FPS, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_wheel_of_time" target="_blank">The Wheel of Time</a>. GOG say this was done in cooperation with Nightdive Studios and that the "efforts and in-house expertise of GOG’s Tech Team the game received modern OS compatibility and hi-resolution support". Although, by modern OS, they only mean Windows specifically.</p>

      <title>Toasty: Ashes of Dusk confirm a Native Linux build is planned, shown off on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Toasty: Ashes of Dusk is an upcoming action RPG that honestly looks great, and now Pocket Llama has issued an update to confirm they will be doing Native Linux support. It's currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketllama/toasty-ashes-of-dusk/description" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, with a little publishing hand from Top Hat Studios (who reached out to use about this) and it's managed to be successfully funded with 22 still to go on the campaign.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketllama/toasty-ashes-of-dusk/posts/3473532" target="_blank">update</a> they said "Thanks to support from our engine provider for the operating system, we're happy to announce that Toasty can run natively on Linux systems, and thus on the Steam Deck as well!". They also showed it running directly on a Steam Deck and confirmed it "runs great" and that "While the install base may not be huge for Linux, we're dedicated to making sure the game can be played by as many players as possible, and all players will be able to receive the optimal Toasty experience".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Open source XR runtime Monado adds initial 6DoF &#39;inside-out&#39; tracking support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little while since we heard progress on Monado, the free and open source XR (VR / AR) runtime for Linux but it has been progressing nicely with a big new feature added. Developer Mateo de Mayo had a six-month internship at Collabora, and decided to <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2022/04/05/visual-inertial-tracking-support-for-monado-openxr/" target="_blank">do a write up</a> on this exciting enhancement for Monado.</p>
<p>Pretty tech-heavy stuff here, and not something for regular consumers to read through and think "ah yes, I understood all that". The basic gist is that Monado, on Linux, can now support XR devices that have cameras and an IMU (Inertial measurement unit) to provide 6DoF (inside-out) tracking utilizing other open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO/" target="_blank">Kimera-VIO</a>, <a href="https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3" target="_blank">ORB-SLAM3</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/VladyslavUsenko/basalt" target="_blank">Basalt.</a></p>
<p>Check out their example video in action, the video shows "an OpenXR application (bottom right), running on Monado, using a RealSense D455 as the data source (top left) and Basalt as the SLAM backend (top right)":</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9g-GWvHke9Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3dc730b410a7b5f99dc240d0a13f379f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9g-GWvHke9Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Collabora also continue <a href="https://www.collabora.com/careers.html" target="_blank">hiring</a>, so if you're after a job in open source and this kind of thing sounds like fun maybe it's time to send them your details.</p>

      <title>GPD are getting quite desperate against the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Think <a href="https://www.gpd.hk/" target="_blank">GPD</a> are a trustworthy company to buy devices from? Well, with the Steam Deck now here, they appear desperate.</p>
<p>Recently, they started taking various Steam Deck videos from YouTube creators, sticking them together with a look at their own devices and not crediting any of the people who put the work into those videos. On top of that, GPD has been attaching a "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)" license to the videos, again, without permission from the original creators.</p>
<p>It's not a good look, and some of those creators have started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxvpsD43QKbz6ZS_HSFiJasrYZ-eo6ozW4" target="_blank">fighting back</a>.</p>
<p>When pulling them up on it on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1509896729633697801" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, I expected some sort of reply (even a snarky one to my obvious bait) or just to do the honourable thing to correctly get permission for using videos from other people. At the very <em>least</em> slapping in a link to the channels they're pinching things from in the description / a pinned comment for people to see. Did any of that happen? No. Instead, here's the official response from GPD:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17314876361649241642gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I've never personally used one of their devices, and would have happily taken a look at any point with Linux installed onto one. Even some direct Steam Deck comparisons. Now though? This is not painting a good picture of GPD as a company.</p>
<p>Here's my video explainer:</p>

      <title>Space Haven adds gamepad support, gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news space sim colony-building fans, as Space Haven just got a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/979110/view/3200378629630609859" target="_blank">upgrade</a> and now it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Previously, it was given a Playable rating and it was tested with Proton. As of today, the developer released a new update adding in Steam Deck and Gamepad support directly. Seems they got a lightning fast turnaround on retesting, as it's now fully Verified with the Native Linux build, it's likely they sent Deck Verified their build before release to test to enable it to be Verified as it's released.</p>
<p>Other additions include a new wall style, meat and fruit plants have their own growth stage graphics and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>Space Haven is actually a <em>great</em> game, one worth checking out and thanks to this update — now even more so!</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/space-haven?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/space_haven?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Factorio improves low resolutions for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playing Factorio on Steam Deck and low screen resolutions gets better, with a fresh update out now for all players.</p>
<p>One of the problems a lot of developers face with the Steam Deck, is the screen size and resolution. A lot of games have quite a small interface, and text that cannot scale — an area that will be a constant improvement for games. Factorio being the latest that's tweaked it.</p>
<p>Along with various bug fixes, the latest update also makes adds some "GUI fixes and improvements for screen resolutions under 1920x1080" and also sets "the default GUI scale on the Steam Deck to 100%". Wube Software LTD. also improved performance when zoomed out, and the multiplayer games browser can now filter games that are hosted on dedicated servers.</p>

<p>Will you be playing Factorio on Steam Deck? Hopefully this will push it more towards being Verified, as Valve have only given it a Playable rating for the Steam Deck currently. From my own test, it seems to run quite well but I'm not overly fond of the controls. It needs updating for gamepad icons for starters, as all the on-screen prompts are for keyboards. However, the official Steam Deck bindings for Steam Input make great use of Action Set Layers, to enable different functions when you hold down a certain button for example, and that works well but you need to learn them all to play it properly.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck improves Offline Mode switching, looks like a lock screen is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has updated the Steam Deck software again, this time giving a little improvement to the way they handle Offline Mode, plus a bunch of other improvements.</p>
<p>Before getting into what's available now though, how about something else that's exciting? It seems Valve are preparing to have a lock screen on the Steam Deck. This is something I've seen people mention as an issue on Reddit, as the Deck isn't just like a console, it's also a PC too with a full desktop mode where you can have more sensitive info. So, a little security makes sense. Thanks to a tip in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/2ae90bd112cd2ebc3da54c72562dd580da526062#diff-ba7b9008074b7876f8483f3a292bffbe89a75c1e3de35697cee472038b9c175fR5717" target="_blank">SteamDB tracker</a> has shown that it's being worked on. Some of the relevant new text strings are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LockScreen_IncorrectPIN": "Incorrect PIN, try again.",<br/>
"LockScreen_ForgotPIN": "Forgot your PIN?",<br/>
"LockScreen_ResetDescription": "If you have forgotten the system PIN for this Steam Deck, you can reset it by logging into Steam with the username and password of the user who created the PIN. You will need the password for %1$s.",<br/>
"LockScreen_ResetWarning": "By starting the reset process, the current user will be logged out of Steam and all games will be automatically closed.",<br/>
"LockScreen_Reset": "Reset PIN",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Title": "Lock Screen PIN Reset",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Body": "The lock screen PIN associated with your Steam Deck has been cleared. You will need to create a new PIN and enable the lock screen if you wish to continue using the feature.",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Question": "Would you like to create a new lock screen PIN?",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Settings": "Create new PIN",</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3215014689194345914" target="_blank">new</a> from the Deck update landing April 6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Offline Mode so that entering and exiting this mode no longer requires restarting Steam</li>
<li>Added support for showing the Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch controller equivalents of the Steam button in the footer</li>
<li>Added a new section to App Properties where users can provide Steam Deck Compatibility feedback or change their previous feedback</li>
<li>Added callout when a title has developer comments about Steam Deck compatibility to the Store on Steam Deck and on the desktop client</li>
<li>Added Steam Input API logo for layouts using the feature in the controller layout browser</li>
<li>Fixed collection detail view in the Library so that pressing B will now go back to the All Collections view</li>
<li>Fixed Store and Community views sometimes ignoring first button press</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Library preventing navigation from going back to all collections</li>
<li>Installing Chrome now installs the version from the flatpak stable repository</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Keyboard
<ul>
<li>Updated bounds for dual trackpad typing so that users can reach the extents of the keyboard more easily</li>
<li>Added dual trackpad typing support for Steam Items, Emoji keyboard, tintable emoji popup, and extended character row popup</li>
<li>Increased strength of haptics when moving trackpad pointer over a new key</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a long press on tintable emojis didn't show the popup to select the actual tint colors</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the extended character popup was cut off if the long press was on a key in the top row</li>
<li>Fixed a focus bug after making a selection in the extended character row popup</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Big Picture keyboard and Steam Deck keyboard could both be visible in desktop mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad to see the adjustment on the trackpad typing, as I was finding it at times a little difficult to move around to the edges at times and testing this morning — it's a big improvement. The slight increase to the haptic feedback is a good touch too, feels better overall and just that bit more like real typing.</p>

<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has rolled out today, and thankfully for fans of these LEGO games you can get it working on Steam Deck and Linux thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>In this case, specifically you need <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, the community-built version. Valve have given it an "Unsupported" rating on Steam Deck and it's not surprising for now. With the current Proton 7, even the intro movies are a mess of stuttering and out of sync audio. Proton Experimental is better but performance is still not great. GE-Proton 7.14 seems to work the best for now, although the game (even on Windows) has some performance problems overall it appears.</p>
<p>Here's an early look at it running on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wVwh2PIDBFE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c76e929ca717447bce1d6e56b284c5e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wVwh2PIDBFE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Getting it running initially was a mess though. For some reason, the download was quite corrupt and I had to verify the files on it <em>twice</em> to get it properly in shape. Seems I'm not the only one it happened to — strange. These things sadly happen from time to time.</p>
<p>Need to know how to install GE-Proton? It's quite simple. Here's the how on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6doaQNnHR60"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37b4fc871ab3188f385a1c60a2e0949c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can use the same method on a Linux desktop too. Text guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a> (Using the Discover software centre on Steam Deck), or use the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">AppImage</a>.</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt, click Add Version and select the latest for GE-Proton, then hit Install.</li>
<li>Once done, restart Steam so it refreshes the compatibility tools list.</li>
<li>Go into the Properties menu for the game, select Compatibility on the left and tick the box to force a version and select the GE-Proton you downloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Trilogies in Any Order – Players will relive the epic story of all nine films in the Skywalker Saga, and it all starts with picking the trilogy of their choice to begin the journey.</li>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5 has officially launched, lots of Linux and Vulkan improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being available in Early Access since May 2021 and Preview since February 2022, Epic Games has today released Unreal Engine 5 which will no doubt go on to power some of the biggest upcoming releases.</p>
<p>"With this release, we aim to empower both large and small teams to really push the boundaries of what’s possible, visually and interactively. UE5 will enable you to realize next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences with greater freedom, fidelity, and flexibility than ever before." — Epic Games.</p>
<p>Epic say that developers will be able to continue using "workflows supported in UE 4.27" but get access to the redesigned Unreal Editor, better performance, improved path tracing and the list goes on.</p>
<p>You can see the whole launch event livestream in the below YouTube video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7ZLibi6s_ew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8dc00fb82dabe75b99a99f629d22b789.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7ZLibi6s_ew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Two new starter samples have also been made for developers with:</p>
<p><strong>Lyra Starter Game</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lyra Starter Game is a sample gameplay project built alongside Unreal Engine 5 development to serve as an excellent starting point for creating new games, as well as a hands-on learning resource. We plan to continue to upgrade this living project with future releases to demonstrate our latest best practices.</p>

<p><strong>City Sample</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The City Sample is a free downloadable sample project that reveals how the city scene from The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience was built. The project—which consists of a complete city with buildings, vehicles, and crowds of MetaHuman characters—demonstrates how we used new and improved systems in Unreal Engine 5 to create the experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13880939641649173068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13880939641649173068gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You will also find plenty of Linux and Vulkan improvements for Unreal Engine 5 including: Nanite and Lumen (with software ray tracing only) on Linux, the Unreal Build Tool was also upgraded to support Clang's sanitizers for Linux (and Android), Vulkan and Linux support was also added to their "GameplayMediaEncoder", compliant 64-bit image atomics in Vulkan that fixes all validation issues with 64-bit atomics and allows the use of RADV driver (AMD + Linux) for Nanite and Lumen, multiple crashes were solved for Linux and loads more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Increased Unix Cycles64 resolution to 100ns</li>
<li>Fixed Unix crash messages printing a truncated memory address.</li>
<li>Added support for asynchronous logging on forked instances</li>
<li>SkeletalMeshComponents will now run multithreadable tasks on the taskgraph on forked multithreaded servers</li>
<li>Moved FForkProcessHelper code in Fork.cpp.</li>
<li>Added FForkProcessHelper::IsForkRequested function. This returns true when the process is set to fork child processes or simulate forking by itself.</li>
<li>Implemented FUnixPlatformMisc::GetCPUVendor and GetCPUBrand() for non x64 Linux platforms to read and parse the /proc/cpuinfo file. Added tables for 64-bit arm cpu implementers and part numbers. This table may have further updates in the future.</li>
<li>FUnixPlatformProcess::CreateProc no longer requires you to pass an absolute path to an executable. If passed an argument containing a program name but no path separators, it now searches directories specified in the $PATH environment variable in the same manner as the shell would. The underlying API has changed from posix_spawn to posix_spawnp, and failures are no longer treated as fatal.</li>
<li>Add Linux -crashhandlerstacksize command line option to set crash handler stack size.</li>
<li>Moved stack to mapped memory instead of allocating in the heap. This can set and reduce the size of the 200k stack significantly through the command line.</li>
<li>Add DumpGPU viewer script for Linux and Mac. To use this, run the DumpGPU command in the console. This will open a folder to the DumpGPU HTML files and data, plus OpenGPUDumpViewer.sh. If you open OpenGPUDumpViewer.sh, the GPU Viewer will open in your web browser.</li>
<li>Updated Linux SDL to 2.0.20.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Epic has confirmed that over 85 game studios are going to be using Unreal Engine 5 with more coming including The Coalition, CD PROJEKT RED, and Crystal Dynamics, who just revealed that they are building a new Tomb Raider game with UE5.</p>

      <title>A new tool &#39;unsnap&#39; helps you move from Snaps to Flatpaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to migrate over from Snaps to Flatpaks on your Linux machine? Well, unsnap is a new tool in the early stages that will help you do just that. Developed by Alan Pope, who previously worked for Canonical and was an advocate for Snap packages, it's certainly an eyebrow raising move.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: to allow you to quickly and easily migrate from Snap to Flatpak applications. Done over a two-stage process, it allows you to "view and/or edit the scripts prior to execution to validate or tweak them".</p>
<p>Right now, it's considered to be in the "Pre-alpha" stage, so not for production machines but eventually it could prove to be quite useful.</p>
<p>An example shot from Pope on the <a href="https://github.com/popey/unsnap" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17504075321649167454gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17504075321649167454gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Considering how popular Flatpak has become (especially with it used on the Steam Deck), it's not a big surprise to see something like this come along.</p>
<p>There's a lot more info on the <a href="https://github.com/popey/unsnap" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Steam Deck hit me over the head with feelings of nostalgia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something happened to me recently while playing the Steam Deck that I felt the need to share with you.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck may be a modern device but it's been giving me a <em>very</em> heavy dose of nostalgia recently. No, it's not because it's a <em>great</em> machine for emulation, which I've done very little of so far because so many amazing modern games work but for something totally different.</p>
<p>Here's something it reminds me of: I grew up with the likes of the Game Boy. In fact, I originally had the Game Boy Pocket, the one you could see through the case and get a look at the insides. I used to stay up far too late playing Pokémon Yellow, with one of those terrible bulky light and magnifier <a href="https://www.retronintendostore.com/gameboy-classic/gameboy-magnifying-glass-light" target="_blank">attachments</a> which had quite a bit of weight to it with the batteries inside. To me, the Steam Deck is bringing back memories of that. As weird as it might be to say from a modern device, the injection of nostalgia I've been getting has been quite wonderful.</p>
<p>Another favourite of mine was the Sega Mega Drive, also known as the Genesis. Another I stayed up late with playing through various versions of Sonic, Gunstar Heroes, Altered Beast and a great many more. Ah, the days of grabbing a box that contained more than one game on the cartridge — what an exciting time that was to be alive.</p>
<p>In my recent <a href="https://youtu.be/aPLI5f7yDCo" target="_blank">two month video</a> (and touched on <a href="https://youtu.be/PoG1yQr4D2M" target="_blank">with the long chat</a> between myself and YouTubers Jason, Gardiner and Nick), I mentioned how the Steam Deck freed me from my desk and how I enjoyed taking the Steam Deck to my sofa to chill-out with but it's a <em>lot</em> more than that.</p>
<p>The suspend feature, and how smooth it is, has become a true life saver. Slightly hyperbolic of course, this isn't life or death, but a fantastic bit of convenience. Being able to get a quick 20 or 30 minutes here and there between things, to just tap the power button and come back to the exact same spot later with hardly any battery drain is pure <strong>joy</strong>.</p>
<p>All these feelings of nostalgia just suddenly came rushing in recently, as I sat in bed tucked up with my Steam Deck one night playing games, I truly realised how far we've come with the tech and it's simply incredible. What Valve has done here is give us a device we can play our favourites from early console generations to some of the latest AAA games.</p>
<p>It's such a nerdy device but even so, I really hope it gains mass appeal for how versatile it is.</p>
<p>A brilliant comment I saw on one of my previous videos said to the effect of: it's my glass slipper that fits. That felt like a pretty fun comparison and I love it.</p>
<p>If you wish to hear me talk about this on video with the soothing visuals of the classic Gunstar Heroes played on a Steam Deck with RetroArch, check it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qHYVcIb9xbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15a839370a260dc3ecb6f49b08279452.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qHYVcIb9xbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>ICYMI - Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valve-might-send-steam-deck-purchase-emails-twice-a-week/" target="_blank">now ramping up production</a>, some emails will go out twice a week.</p>

      <title>Wine manager &#39;Bottles&#39; improves Steam Proton support, adds configurable environments</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles, a free and open source application for Linux (that works well on the Steam Deck), has another new release out bringing in major new features.</p>
<p>Since a previous version, it came with support for pre-configured environments (Gaming and Applications), which has been massively extended in version 2022.3.28. Now, you can setup your own configuration and share these environments with others, so in a way it's sliding closer to some capabilities of Lutris. These environments are configured with a YAML file making them easy to parse and read.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's improved support for Steam Play Proton directly. It's under heavy development and still experimental but Bottles can now read Steam Launch Options for games installed via Proton and deal with them in Bottles directly and configure certain settings in Bottles. This eventually might make it far easier than manually editing Steam launch options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21099643731649161496gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21099643731649161496gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This release also brings a command-line environment for Bottles too, <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.3.28/" target="_blank">amongst other things</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Plugin Loader gets upgraded, easier to install</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to mod the Steam Deck? SteamOS Plugin Manager (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steamos-plugin-manager-should-enable-lots-of-fun-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">covered here previously</a>) has been renamed to just <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a> and it's had a bit of a Python rewrite recently to make it better. As a result, it's now far easier to install too, along with having its first proper initial release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8213246971649154202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8213246971649154202gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Just an example shot from the developer.</em></p>
<p>To install it, this is now all you need to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Go into the Steam Deck Settings</li>
<li>Under System -&gt; System Settings toggle <code class="inline-code">Enable Developer Mode</code></li>
<li>Scroll the sidebar all the way down and click on <code class="inline-code">Developer</code></li>
<li>Under Miscellaneous, enable <code class="inline-code">CEF Remote Debugging</code></li>
<li>Click on the <code class="inline-code">STEAM</code> button and select <code class="inline-code">Power</code> -&gt; <code class="inline-code">Switch to Desktop</code></li>
<li>Open a terminal and paste the following command into it: <code class="inline-code">curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader/raw/main/dist/install_release.sh | sh</code></li>
<li>Done! Reboot back into Gaming mode and enjoy your plugins!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It will create a "/home/deck/homebrew/plugins/" folder path where you can put Plugins you find inside.</p>
<p>Once some fun Plugins are available, I'll be taking a good look at it. Be sure to let us know if anything interesting releases that's properly compatible with it. Still early days for the project but it's incredibly promising and hopefully more will pick it up and help develop it further.</p>

      <title>dbrand now have Steam Deck Skins and Wraps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to customize your Steam Deck look to match your style? Well, at least with dbrand now you can and they have some nice looking choices to mix together.</p>
<p>On their system you can order (each being separate and costing extra): a front skin ($19.95), back skin ($14.95), trackpad skins ($4.95) and tempered glass screen protectors (two pack $24.95). There's 28 different skin colours or patterns in total, so you can really make something wild — or nice and tame, whatever you want.</p>
<p>You could come up with something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3582290131649152113gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3582290131649152113gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Or maybe this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14376013401649152114gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14376013401649152114gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Shipping will begin before the end of April. I've put an order in, so we can take a look once they ship.</p>
<p>Check them <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/steam-deck-skins" target="_blank">out on dbrand</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Developer Mode does not turn off the read-only filesystem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was pointed out recently that there's been plenty of confusion on exactly what Developer Mode for the Steam Deck does. Even I've gotten it wrong in the past, so it's time to set the record straight. My friend and YouTube star Gardiner recently pointed it out on <a href="https://twitter.com/gardiner_bryant/status/1510801362535297025" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and it's worth repeating.</p>
<p>Developer Mode enables access to numerous extra options and tweaks on the Steam Deck, as the name suggests it's primarily meant for developers and there's a few bits and pieces in there that might help modders. It does <u>not</u>, however, turn off the read-only filesystem.</p>
<p>The confusion comes from Valve, as originally their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq" target="_blank">developer documentation</a> (almost of us had to go on before their FAQs went live) mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Will SteamOS have a read-only immutable OS file system?</strong><br/>
<br/>
Yes. By default the OS updates will be distributed as a whole OS image. But any user can enter a developer mode, which will let them modify the file system and install packages like a normal distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now though, that's not the case. I sent a quick Twitter post to a Valve developer, who has now <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1511027026437632001" target="_blank">updated it</a> and corrected the record to be clearer. This is what it tells people now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Will SteamOS have a read-only immutable OS file system?</strong><br/>
<br/>
Yes. By default the OS updates will be distributed as a whole OS image, and we recommend installing additional applications via flatpak to avoid issues. If customers want to do more than what’s available by flatpak, they can turn off read-only mode. We don't recommend this though, as they may get their Steam Deck into a bad state or compromise their data. In addition, anything installed outside of flatpak (via pacman for instance) may be wiped with the next SteamOS update. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C" target="_blank">More on that here.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning off the read-only filesystem requires a terminal command, which you can find in the previous link. Again, not recommended for the average user.</p>
<p>What does Developer Mode give you? Here's some of the options it currently opens up:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19742039921649092888gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19742039921649092888gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5487440341649092888gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5487440341649092888gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5866106711649092889gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5866106711649092889gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Coromon is pretty much Pokemon for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love monster catching and want a bit of a Pokemon-like game for the Steam Deck (or any Linux desktop too)? Check out the newly released Coromon. Developed by TRAGsoft, it released on March 31 and thanks to Steam Play Proton, it's working great out of the box.</p>
<p>"The sun begins to dawn on Velua, a new day for the world and a new day for you, a freshly minted Battle Researcher of the global research society known as Lux Solis. It’s your first day and everything goes smoothly until a mysterious force attacks your latest workplace. Build up a squad of Coromon, track down the invaders, and grapple with a rising threat that endangers everyone on Velua!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2E3VXi_moQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/84a7792ec6e93fa2ac9c69dda1df1fba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2E3VXi_moQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It <em>really</em> is a Pokemon-like, <em>massively</em> inspired by the classics but with plenty of modern touches. Honestly, it's so close to Pokemon you could say it's nearly a clone. All the basic mechanics are similar but it's unique enough to enjoy anyway thanks to the different setting and totally original creatures. The artwork is gorgeous too, I'm a little in love with the overall style of it. The developer seemingly hasn't really taken many risks here, using the tried and battle-tested mechanics from its inspiration.</p>
<p>The difficulty selection is a great addition too. Allowing players who want it, to have quite a challenge with battles becoming something you really need to be careful with on Hard mode, if a creature in your party faints in this mode, it will leave you. There's plenty of wiggle room to have the experience you want though.</p>
<p>Here's some of the early gameplay showing off the basic mechanics (captured on Steam Deck):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZRCRTavxLO0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f3c6fa1eb3de1b53897da563eac27d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZRCRTavxLO0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can confirm it felt and looks great on Deck. Performance is a bit up and down in some places but you don't notice the spikes in actual gameplay. One problem <em>does</em> remain though, that I will <em>warn</em> you on: at random after a few encounters, it seems to drop down to 14FPS and lock itself there. No idea what the cause is so keep that in mind, other than that it's great and hasn't stopped me enjoying it but it is a real problem that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build a team from more than 100 charming creatures, defined by their elements, traits, and skills. Catch, train then set them loose on your rivals!</li>
<li>Master a stamina-based battle system where every action costs energy, so choose skills and attacks carefully. Deal damage, sap enemy stamina with status effects, or nullify them through dozens of conditions to emerge victorious.</li>
<li>Challenge friends online and see whose Coromon squads are the best of the best.</li>
<li>Pursue the antagonists’ trail across six major zones and cities, with dozens of interconnecting routes to explore. Each one brimming with quests, secrets, and items to find.</li>
<li>Explore the furthest reaches of Velua, from frozen glacial caverns to the depths of blistering deserts.</li>
<li>Play a key role throughout a fully-fledged classic JRPG narrative, complete with plot twists, turns, and revelations that not all is as it seems...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1218210/Coromon/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve might send Steam Deck purchase emails twice a week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keep an even closer eye on your inbox, as Valve has announced that we might see reservation emails for the Steam Deck go out twice a week sometimes now.</p>
<p>Each Monday is the usual day for new emails to go out, so people sitting waiting can finally put their Steam Deck order through. That might change some weeks, as Valve explained on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1511019543803543556" target="_blank">Twitter</a> today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Q2! We've just sent out the first set of order emails to Q2 reservers (in order of reservation time). Starting today we're ramping up Steam Deck shipments, and will be sending more order availability emails every week. Sometimes even twice a week!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in a <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1511045220493787136" target="_blank">reply</a> to someone it was clarified as Monday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Since people were getting confused somehow on what a quarter is during a year, Valve also a little while ago updated the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck page</a> to show the months in brackets for when you can expect an email to come through. A refresher as apparently some people need it:</p>
<ul>
<li>January, February, and March (Q1)</li>
<li>April, May, and June (Q2)</li>
<li>July, August, and September (Q3)</li>
<li>October, November, and December (Q4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Really good to know Valve are able to ramp up production now, as they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-expect-to-make-hundreds-of-thousands-of-steam-decks-next-month/" target="_blank">did say previously</a> they were expecting hundreds of thousands from this month onwards.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton gets upgraded with Feral GameMode added (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: And just like that, GameMode is gone. GE-Proton7-14 rolled out, which mentioned "Hotfix: Received more complaints than praise surrounding the gamemode change so I've reverted the changes. Gamemode is removed from the build and will not be used by default.". Really, you should stick with official Proton unless GE-Proton fixes a specific issue you need.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, the unofficial community-built version of the Proton compatibility layer has a new version out (and some hotfixes). Quick primer: Proton is a compatibility layer from Valve (who work with CodeWeavers), that runs Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck. Need more info on Steam Play and Proton? Check out <a href="http://www.steamproton.com" target="_blank">our page</a>.</p>
<p>This version of Proton, named GE-Proton (formerly Proton-GE), pulls in fixes faster but it comes without the quality assurance the official version has. It also has a fix a lot of people enjoy to enable videos in some games to work properly, where they don't with the official Proton.</p>
<p>GE-Proton7-11 and hotfixes up to GE-Proton7-13 are now available, here's what they add and fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feral Interactive's '<a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" target="_blank">gamemode</a>' has been added to the build and will now be automatically used when games are launched (you no longer need to run 'gamemode %command%') (Thanks manueliglesiasgarcia!)</li>
<li>Proton Experimental bleeding edge wine build has been updated (fixes a prefix creation bug)</li>
<li>Several build-specific updates have been pulled from upstream proton</li>
<li>DXVK updated to git</li>
<li>VKD3D-Proton updated to git</li>
<li>DXVK-nvapi updated to git</li>
<li>A hotfix to enable New World since it's launcher hangs. The developer has added the Easy Anti-Cheat file needed for Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding GameMode by default though is a bit of a controversial change, since it can cause some games to crash (like Apex Legends). Hopefully the issue will be found and solved).</p>
<p>Want to know how to install it on Linux and Steam Deck? You can do it with ProtonUp-Qt:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom" target="_blank">Wine-GE</a> was also updated from the same developer, to fix a prefix creation bug.</p>

<p>Super Bernie World, a free platformer that released back in 2020, is getting a paid DLC named Kitsune Zero. It's going to be a prequel to their upcoming platformer Kitsune Tails, which takes inspiration from platformers later in the 8-bit generation, that will release in 2023.</p>
<p>"Run, jump, and stomp on ghostlike creatures from Japanese folklore lurking in the countryside and castles. Collect powerups that make Yumi grow in size, grant fireball abilities, and make her invincible for a short time. Gather the necessary ingredients to break the pact's magic and take down the leader of the samurai clan to end the war.</p>
<p>Traverse four worlds, each containing two vibrant outdoor levels and one daunting medieval castle. Overcome the challenges of each of the 12 levels and unlock new bonus levels not seen in Super Bernie World! Explore environments based on Japanese culture and mythology in every realm and a story setting the stage for the next generation of kitsune in Kitsune Tails."</p>

<p>"Kitsune Zero and Kitsune Tails don't just represent the past and present of the story we're telling in this universe, but also the start and end points of platformer conventions established on 8-bit consoles," said Emma ‘Eniko’ Maassen. "Each stands alone as its own special experience, but together they form a love letter from our team to the evolution of platformers during that era of gaming history."</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a cute fox girl</li>

      <title>Patrick&#39;s Parabox is an absolutely brilliant mind-bending puzzle game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Patrick's Parabox is a puzzle game about boxes within boxes, it's an absolute gem and I've had a fantastic time playing through this one. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>The reception to it seems to be great too, with a Very Positive user rating on Steam. It has less than 500 reviews right now though, which means plenty of people don't yet know about it. A shame, as puzzle game fans absolutely need to pick up and play this one and I truly mean that.</p>
<p>You've played Sokoban block-pushing puzzle games before I'm sure but nothing like this. It will at times melt down your brain and stuff it into a box. The idea is that you push boxes inside other boxes, that all need moving around into the correct positions. It constantly mixes it up and throws in little new mechanics and it's pure joy to play through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rl_ohYPXNMo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cca7726f590ce6ecd60a30075b988289.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rl_ohYPXNMo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When you eventually get to levels of boxes within boxes within boxes of recursion, it can get challenging. However, Patrick's Parabox is careful not to truly overwhelm you. It's graceful on how it handles the difficulty that never feels ridiculous and I love it.</p>
<p>Could easily be the Puzzle Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://patricktraynor.itch.io/patricks-parabox" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Works really nicely on Steam Deck too, although you do need to quit via the Steam menu due to a black screen issue when you go to exit on Deck.</p>

      <title>RetroDECK is another solution for emulation gaming on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/emudeck-makes-emulation-on-steam-deck-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> not to your liking? Perhaps <a href="https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a> might be what you're after for retro emulation on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Unlike EmuDeck that has you install multiple things in a list, and have them all separated, the idea of RetroDECK is more to bring a "one-click experience, and to separate retrogames from steam library" the developer says. It comes as a Flatpak to install, and from there it should have everything bundled together. Inspired by the likes of 351ELEC (what it's forked from), EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.</p>
<p>Powered by EmulationStation Desktop Edition, RetroArch and various standalone emulators it allows you to import your favourites into a tidy environment without flooding your Steam library. Available as a Flatpak you can easily download and install from GitHub, it's still early days yet but the idea is promising enough.</p>
<p>Right now, I couldn't personally get it to work properly and the developer said pretty clearly the current releases are intended for testing so it's one to keep an eye on perhaps. I love the idea of it having things properly integrated, far less hoops to jump through.</p>

      <title>Meifumado is an action game set in a post-apocalyptic world inspired by Japan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your pixel-art side-scrolling action RPGs? Keep an eye on Meifumado, as it looks pretty good and it will be coming to Linux the developer has confirmed. It recently had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oldbit/meifumado" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign, where Old Bit Studio raised $48,018 to bring out the full version.</p>
<p>It also popped up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1954130/Meifumado/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and it appeared to note Native Linux support in the system requirements. When asked about it the developer said to us: "Hello. Yes, it is correct. We didn't mention any OS. Kickstarter page says PC. That's including Linux." — so far Native fans it's another one to put on your wishlist.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep combat system offering multiple fighting styles, special attacks/abilities, sub-weapons and various weapon types.</li>
<li>Different non-combat skills: crafting, hunting, stealing.</li>
<li>Exploration of a vast, detailed open world ruined by a global war, consisting of many different kinds of locations divided into multiple metroidvania-structured levels; each with its unique environment and atmosphere.</li>
<li>Heavy focus on RPG elements: choices with consequences, multiple endings depending on player's actions, factions with their own ideologies, that player can join.</li>
<li>Story-driven side quests with multiple ways to complete.</li>
<li>Numerous side activities: guarding or raiding caravans, participation in fighting tournaments, gambling.</li>

      <title>A Short Hike gets Steam Deck Support, and a 99 player multiplayer mod </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can now go on A Short Hike wherever you want with the Steam Deck and perhaps bring along a whole lot of friends too. More about it: Hike, climb, and soar through the peaceful mountainside landscapes of Hawk Peak Provincial Park. Follow the marked trails or explore the backcountry as you make your way to the summit. Along the way, meet other hikers, discover hidden treasures, and take in the world around you.</p>
<p>It's a game that's now Verified for the Linux-powered Steam Deck handheld from Valve! Here's what the developer improved for Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where keyboard glyphs would show up on the start screen even when a controller was plugged in.</li>
<li>Mouse movement alone no longer causes the game to switch from gamepad to keyboard controls.</li>
<li>An in-game license text window is now used when a controller is plugged in.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a sort-of April Fools joke but also a very real thing, there's also now "A Short Hike 99", a free multiplayer mod that allows 99 players to go hiking together. The developer will keep their server up for two weeks but they've also put out a way for anyone to host their own, so it can live on forever.</p>

      <title>Online platformer DDraceNetwork gets Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DDraceNetwork, a free and open source online co-op platformer now has Vulkan API integrated as of the latest update. Starting off life as a simple mod for Teeworlds, nowadays it's a popular standalone multiplayer platformer that can be quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Seems it's remaining somewhat popular too, especially with the Steam release, which sees over 2,000 players online at a time every day. Might not sound like a <em>lot</em> but it's more than the likes of some much more well-known indie and AAA titles, so it is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Main improvements in the latest version:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Client] New Vulkan graphics renderer for more FPS (enable in Graphics Settings)</li>
<li>[Client] Improved demo renderer performance</li>
<li>[Client] New players join Tutorial servers by default</li>
<li>[Client] Replace browser icons with font icons</li>
<li>[Editor] Quad knife tool</li>
</ul>

      <title>2,000 titles officially hit for Steam Deck as Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An impressive milestone has been hit just over a month after the release of the Steam Deck, with now over 2,000 titles being noted as Verified or Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>We know there's problems though, with some games being Verified or Playable where they shouldn't be, which is part of why Valve has a new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">feedback system in place</a>. Overall though, it seems like a small minority of titles, the vast majority are being labelled correctly so it's still a good number to go by for players and potential buyers of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the latest numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1053 - Verified</li>
<li>986 - Playable</li>
<li>1036 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the latest to be Verified or Playable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Short Hike - Verified</li>
<li>DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT - Verified</li>
<li>Fort Triumph - Verified</li>
<li>Killing Floor - Playable</li>
<li>Narita Boy - Verified</li>
<li>Rising Hell - Verified</li>
<li>The Outer Worlds - Playable</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't let the "Unsupported" tag for games be the decider on what you try either, plenty of them are false-negatives like Fallout 76 which works pretty nicely:</p>

      <title>Lutris version 0.5.10 brings improved Steam Deck support but no Flatpak yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lutris, the free and open source game manager for installing games on Linux from many stores, has a <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.10" target="_blank">new version</a> available as work continues to improve Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>While the headline feature from the developer is "Steam Deck support", it's not quite there yet. They've made plenty of steps towards it, but currently there's no Flatpak package that works properly, and so to install you still need to turn off the Deck's read-only filesystem (which we really don't recommend doing). Thankfully, work on the Flatpak is the priority for the next version! Additionally, there's a new "Create Steam shortcut" option to add games from Lutris to Steam so it can be used in Gaming Mode which sounds incredibly useful.</p>
<p><strong>New features include</strong></p>
<p>An expanded "Add Game" box with more options</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1308812661648888270gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1308812661648888270gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Support for Origin and Ubisoft Connect. They work the same as their Epic Games Store integration, with it needing to install the Windows clients. Sadly though, for now Humble Store is broken as Humble updated their API so work is needed to re-do that.</p>
<p>Here's some of the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add a coverart format</li>
<li>Download missing media on startup</li>
<li>Remove Winesteam runner (install Steam for Windows in Lutris instead)</li>
<li>PC (Linux and Windows) games have their own dedicated Nvidia shader cache</li>
<li>Add dgvoodoo2 option</li>
<li>Add option to enable BattleEye anti-cheat support (for those games that support it on Linux / Proton)</li>
<li>Default to Retroarch cores in ~/.config/retroarch/cores if available</li>
<li>Add support for downloading patches and DLC for GOG games</li>
<li>Add --export and --import command line flags to export a game a lutris game and re-import it (requires --dest for the destination path, feature still experimental)</li>
<li>Add command line flags to manage runners: --install-runner, --uninstall-runners, --list-runners, --list-wine-versions</li>
<li>Change behaviour of the "Stop" button, remove "Kill all Wine processes" action</li>
<li>Gamescope option is now disabled on Nvidia GPUs</li>
<li>Enable F-Sync by default</li>
</ul>

      <title>Nightmare Reaper is a quality retro-themed FPS out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightmare Reaper, a retro-inspired FPS that blends together elements of a looter-shooter and a sprinkle of RPG mechanics, recently left Early Access and it works great on Linux and Steam Deck. With Steam Play Proton, it's a perfect experience. <u>Note</u>: key provided for me by Evolve PR.</p>
<p>A blending of many ideas from classic first-person shooters, a lot of the inspiration in the graphical style and level design is clear but it has plenty of modern tweaks too. While modern shooters continue to push the boundaries of graphics, they've lost a lot of what made them fun — which is why games like Nightmare Reaper are just so good. Absolutely pumping action with some great visual effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16054090691648815600gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16054090691648815600gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Your character is currently living in some sort of mental institution, and you've clearly not had an easy life. When you go to sleep, you sort-of lose grip on reality as each dream becomes a fight for your life in dark dungeons. The story might not be anything to write home about but that's okay, the gameplay and fast-paced shooting fully makes up for that side of it. Frankly, I could happily play through all the action without a hint of story because it just flows together so nicely.</p>
<p>Some of it is just complete chaos too, especially when you have the different enemy behaviours to account for while a few of them run right at you. Never a moment to panic though, with the speed of the game and the power of your weapons, ripping and tearing feels great here.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FTHevtRj1Wk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02a657347d80adc7e95ea228b6676056.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FTHevtRj1Wk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Honestly it feels amazing on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Quite challenging at times too. While some of the enemies are easy, others are quite the bullet sponge and deal powerful blows you will need to try and quickly get around. Outside of the combat, there's a few places that need some careful platforming too.</p>
<p>You won't play the same game twice either, as it also merges random level generation with manually crafted levels too, so there's plenty to enjoy as your run through. Not only that, there's quite a few different types of weapons to get to allow you to mix and match your play-style. On top of that, weapons have different levels to them so there's plenty of customization on offer as well. It all adds up to an experience you can't forget.</p>
<p>Thoroughly entertaining, a little gory at times but the pixel style of it with the 2.5D theme really looks awesome. It hits the exact spots you want in such a shooter and you shouldn't miss out on this one.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Pants Quest gets a Linux release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A point and click adventure game all about finding missing clothing? Well, there's been weirder things. Pants Quest gets a native Linux release.</p>
<p>"A classic style adventure game about life and finding your pants. The more our hero tries to find them, the more things seem to spin out of control. The tone is funny but also kind of introspective, following the kind of crappy morning that makes you rethink every decision you’ve ever made while wandering around in your underwear."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I8oApKjKUGA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5b0ec79d8d771f4d5a38640978dead7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I8oApKjKUGA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite a short game this one at about 2 hours but seems like a good bit of comedy. A completely silly concept but if you love your classic adventures maybe one to run through with a coffee.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells &#39;Break the Bank&#39; free upgrade out, more big updates teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motion Twin / Evil Empire have given us another great free update to the fantastic Dead Cells and teased plenty more is coming to the game. With this update you get The Bank, a brand-new optional biome that randomly appears in your run, replacing the immediately following biomes if you choose to enter it.</p>
<p>Here's the main points of the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New optional biome – The Bank</li>
<li>3 new enemies</li>
<li>3 new gold-based weapons</li>
<li>3 new gold-based mutations</li>
<li>More updates and DLC are coming</li>
<li>Many QoL changes and bug fixes - my favourite is items dropped after boss fights now have +1 item level, so no more unsatisfying boss loot!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>As for what's coming next, they reiterated that the free updates are thanks to people buying the DLC, so support can continue for everyone. The good news is that more DLC and free updates are planned for a whole year, with some of it getting the developer "very, very excited".</p>

      <title>SteamOS Plugin Manager should enable lots of fun on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the same developer who created the support library for Tesla overlays, the <a href="https://github.com/WerWolv/SteamOS-Plugin-Manager" target="_blank">SteamOS Plugin Manager</a> is born and ready for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is going to be an absolute delight for people who want to hack away at the Steam Deck, and it can enable all kinds of things from music player integration to simple things like more quick-access buttons. I don't think it's possible to overstate just how awesome a project like this is. You don't even need to turn off the read-only filesystem to do it, and so changes made will be persistent too through OS upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10626873341648808674gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10626873341648808674gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Looks like the installation is reasonably easy too, but no doubt people will eventually find a way to make it super simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Installation</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the Steam Deck Settings</li>
<li>Under System -&gt; System Settings toggle <code class="inline-code">Enable Developer Mode</code></li>
<li>Scroll the sidebar all the way down and click on <code class="inline-code">Developer</code></li>
<li>Under Miscellaneous, enable <code class="inline-code">CEF Remote Debugging</code></li>
<li>Place the executable under <code class="inline-code">~/homebrew/services/plugin_manager</code>. Do not change the name of the file.</li>
<li>Place the plugin_manager.service file under <code class="inline-code">/etc/systemd/system</code></li>
<li>Open a Terminal and type <code class="inline-code">sudo systemctl --now enable plugin_manager</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Install Plugins</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply copy the plugin's .js file into <code class="inline-code">~/homebrew/services/plugin_manager/plugins</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will take a little while for Plugins to be created for it but now it's out in the wild, I cannot wait to see what people come up with, oh the possibilities!</p>
<p>There's seemingly no license on it right now, so I've asked the developer to add one so contributors will know what to expect from it. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer <a href="https://github.com/WerWolv/SteamOS-Plugin-Manager/issues/2#issuecomment-1085995398" target="_blank">replied</a>, and it's now under the GPL license, so it's properly open source.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful crowdfunding campaign a while ago, Dungeon Alchemist is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588530/Dungeon_Alchemist/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Not a game though, however, instead it's a special tool for creators to make really fancy looking maps to use elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is a tool for RPG fans who like to create things, and have them printed out to play like some sort of a pen and paper tabletop RPG. Not only that though, it also supports some popular VTT programs too so you can create and import your projects into them and play them there.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An easy-to-use, intuitive interface that allows you to create high-quality maps, fast!</li>
<li>An ever-growing list of themes and rooms that can be instantly generated</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's in Early Access and they estimate it shall remain there for about half a year.</p>

      <title>Minecraft Snapshot gets Ancient Cities and the Allay friendly mob</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang continue working towards the next major Minecraft update, with another Java Snapshot out now bringing in more big features to play with.</p>
<p>Snapshot <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-22w13a" target="_blank">22w13a</a> adds in the Allay a shiny blue friend for players that will collect items for you that matches what you're holding. To get an Allay to like you, they want to be handed an item and they also seem to love hearing noteblocks play tunes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4083571911648806686gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4083571911648806686gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The other major addition is the inclusion of Ancient Cities, which can be found in the Deep Dark biome. They were in an experimental version before, but now they've seen some big changes. There's a new Swift Sneaking enchantment you can find in chests guarded by Sculk Sensors and Shriekers, there's a new block called "Reinforced Deepslate" (not available in Survival) and no mobs spawn there — as they're supposed to be abandoned.</p>

      <title>GameMaker on Linux gets big improvements and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GameMaker Studio 2 is now just GameMaker, and there's a <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/blog/release-2022-3" target="_blank">new update</a> out with some dramatic improvements for Linux game exports and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>For far too long, GameMaker exports for Linux have required some very specific dependencies, which often caused issues for developers as they weren't included directly. Game developers had to go and manually grab these files to include with the Linux games. Now, that's not required - at least for Steam anyway.</p>
<p>If developers are putting their games on Steam, the export there will now properly target the Steam Linux Runtime, where Valve handle the dependencies and include a ton of them. It's what all Steam games for Linux should target. This means games should be click and play on Steam, with developers not needing extra steps. With this, they've also added direct support for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On top of that, their "Ubuntu (Linux)" target now gives an AppImage.</p>
<p>Their video player also got a nice upgrade, which now works on all platforms.</p>
<p>I have to say, I was a bit worried when YoYo Games were acquired by Opera but they seem to be doing some pretty good upgrades lately. It's just a shame they moved over to subscriptions for the software.</p>

      <title>Steam Client Beta gets Linux fixes like not re-download media pre-caching files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not just the Steam Deck that is getting upgrades, as Valve are also tweaking the main Steam client with a fresh Beta release out now. This one actually does fix some pretty annoying issues, some of which should really make things easier.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3189118991320514548" target="_blank">new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Cloud</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed sync error for games which have converted Cloud-saved files into directories</li>
<li>Fixed Cloud sync for some games with slightly malformed cross-platform Steam Cloud sync settings</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where updating graphics drivers would re-download media pre-caching files</li>
<li>Added home and mounted drive paths to the file picker quick bar</li>
<li>Fixed the file picker extension filters not appearing when selecting Library custom art</li>
<li>Added the ability for the file picker to remember the previous location when selecting Library custom art</li>
<li>Fixed adding non-Steam shortcuts with spaces in the path</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Valve finally pay some attention to the file picker, as that was left as extremely basic for so long. With the Steam Deck though, people are doing a lot with desktop mode with adding third-party software, so a lot of this was needed there too. Should just make doing that a smoother process. Good to see Valve really paying attention to every part of Steam lately.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a bunch more Keyboard tweaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve is really doing some great work on improving the Steam Deck, with another upgrade now available.</p>
<p>Just recently they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-gets-a-big-client-update-plus-deck-os-and-bios-beta-update/" target="_blank">overhauled the on-screen keyboard</a>, to give it the excellent dual-trackpad mode and now they've continued the tweaks. Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3215014689179840548" target="_blank">new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Active keyboard theme is now loaded in desktop mode</li>
<li>Keyboard input is now sent on trackpad click down, instead of up, which should improve accuracy for fast trackpad typists</li>
<li>Made the default keyboard theme "pressed" key state more noticeable</li>
<li>Pressing R2/Enter no longer dismisses the keyboard in Desktop mode</li>
<li>Removed two second latency hiding trackpad cursors when the trackpads are no longer in use</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Steam Client on Desktop scaling when the standalone keyboard is shown</li>
<li>Fixed issue where transcoded video/audio was re-downloaded on a driver change</li>
<li>Fixed some missing localization in the controller configurator</li>
</ul>

      <title>The latest and greatest Vulkan extension has arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You thought they were done with the Vulkan API? Think again. To mark Vulkan 1.0 being 2236 days old (give or take), a brand new extension has been revealed. <em>This is an absolute game changer, there's no other way to frame this.</em></p>
<p>Presenting: <a href="http://printedsurface.ink/" target="_blank">VK_FOOL_printed_surface</a></p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton" target="_blank">Joshua Ashton</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liam-middlebrook" target="_blank">Liam Middlebrook</a>, who are both involved in many Linux related things, Liam handled the majority of the specification work, while Josh handled the CUPS layer implementation.</p>
<p>Okay, so what does it do? They say it's the "newest innovation in the cross section of the Printed Media and Vulkan ecosystems" and their hype around it is definitely warranted. This extension allows you to print frames, in Vulkan. That's right, printing for everyone and high ink rates too!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can print frames in Vulkan now! No longer are the days of yore when a frame would only last until the next vkQueuePresent() landed. Now you can cherish your favorite frames and have them last forever. Hang up your new family heirloom on the wall, or put them in a time-capsule for generations to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2167706041648745636gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2167706041648745636gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>"Bringing Vulkan to the workplace"</em></p>
<p>Of course the full Vulkan specification sheet has been upgraded for this new extension too, and it answers a lot of burning questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4) Printers are inherently complex devices which are not yet fully understood by humanity, does the current set of error codes available in Vulkan allow for implementations to adequately express the various states of disarray encountered when a print is not successful?</p>
<p>RESOLVED: To the best of our ability we have introduced new Vulkan error codes which should help implementations express the complex state of printers. This list is likely not exhaustive and may be expanded in a future extension.</p>
<p>7) Why would someone want to see a printed frame?</p>
<p>RESOLVED: This is a stupid question. For thousands of years humanity has pursued artistic passion and looked to immortalize their creations. This pursuit obviously extends to the printed frame.</p>
<p>21) Will the extension support tearing?</p>
<p>RESOLVED: No. The printed surface will only support perfect prints. Tearing is left to the end-user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a joke? What's going on? You decide. Only the smartest will be able to figure it out.</p>
<p>This can't possibly be real though right? See for yourself:</p>

      <title>Steam Play Proton could get direct support for NVIDIA Image Scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An engineer from NVIDIA has put up a Pull Request on the official Wine repository that Valve uses for Proton, suggesting a rather fun new feature be added.</p>
<p>Developer Eric Sullivan put up the Pull Request titled "<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/141" target="_blank">Support for NVIDIA Image Scaling</a>", if accepted it could mean a future release of Proton would enable users (of any GPU vendor - it's a simple shader) to upscale applications to the current display resolution with NVIDIA Image Scaling. The idea of that sounds pretty exciting, as the more options it supports the better.</p>
<p>While it's true developers can add options like this officially into games like what already happens with NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR and other tech, this is much more of a brute-force approach to give Proton the ability to do it to any game, (a bit like how you can do FSR on the Steam Deck).</p>
<p>From the pull request:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="edit-comment-hide">
<div class="comment-body markdown-body js-comment-body soft-wrap user-select-contain d-block">
<p>This pull request adds an option to fshack to upscale applications to the current display resolution with NVIDIA Image Scaling. It can be enabled by setting the WINE_FULLSCREEN_UPSCALER environment variable to "NIS". The NIS upscaler also supports using FP16 storage by setting WINE_NIS_UPSCALER_USE_FP16 to 1.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It should go without saying but I will anyway: this might not be accepted, so don't get overly excited just yet.</p>

      <title>OneXPlayer looking at shipping handhelds with SteamOS like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer</a> are a series of handheld gaming devices, they're somewhat popular and it appears they've been keeping a close eye on SteamOS and how it's been working on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Currently they offer various models like the OneXPlayer Mini, OneXPlayer 1S, two AMD models and the One-GX 1 Laptop. However, all of them currently ship with Windows. Some of them are pretty powerful too, like the currently sold-out "ONEXPLAYER AMD® - 8.4 inch Ryzen® 5700U" model. Their prices are quite a bit higher than Steam Deck too, with that model in particular retailing at $1,419.</p>
<p>The good news is that they might actually be shipping SteamOS Linux in future, bringing them more in line with what the Steam Deck can do. As <a href="https://www.wepc.com/news/onexplayer-interview/" target="_blank">WePC</a> recently did an interview with the VP of OneXPlayer, Jason Zeng. Here's the excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zeng continued to share his opinions on Valve’s market-disrupting machine by giving his stance on how Valve managed to achieve success with the device. ‘Steam Deck is a very influential product that has managed to leverage its accumulated assets and bring [the] public’s attention to the field of portable gaming. We sincerely congratulate Steam Deck for its achievements, and will keep working on our competitive edges.’<br/>
<small>[…]</small><br/>
Of particular note is how the Proton developers actually improved performance in games such as Elden Ring, which highlights the OS against running something a little harder on the system like Windows 11. Zeng comments that the team has been ‘working on’ shipping the OneXPlayer line of devices with a build of Linux or SteamOS in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having more devices out there shipping Linux sound awesome. However, they seem to have no plans for cheaper devices right now, so you might want to keep waiting on and sticking with the Steam Deck if you don't have a ton of spare cash stuffed under your bed.</p>

      <title>Chrome on Steam Deck now supports the Deck Controller, with GeForce NOW working</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news Cloud Gaming fans, as it appears the version of Chrome available on the Steam Deck is now the correct version needed to detect the gamepad. With two small quick fixes, you can play GeForce NOW on Steam Deck easily.</p>
<p>I was waiting on the Chrome update to ship to properly show off Cloud Gaming, which was available in the Dev and Beta versions of Chrome for a little while. You can see on the official <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/c9bc4476626e413fac9fac8b08e4b2110ee344f2" target="_blank">Chromium tracker</a> that it has now shipped, and checking the Chrome version on Deck today, it's the same.</p>
<p>Using the version of Chrome available on the Steam Deck, which you can install via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library of Gaming Mode, it's possible to tweak it to get it working fully.</p>
<ol>
<li>To get the Chrome package to work with the Deck controller, you need to do what Microsoft said in their guide for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">Edge and Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> with this quick terminal command in Konsole in Desktop Mode (with Edge changed to Chrome of course): <code class="inline-code">flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code></li>
<li>While in Gaming Mode, you will also want to set Steam Input on Chrome to be in "Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad" mode, along with one edit to set the Right Trackpad click behaviour to be a Left Mouse button. This just enables you to interact with Chrome and click things properly. Any other Steam Input mode, and the Deck Controller will <em>not</em> be picked up by Chrome.</li>
<li>If you want to get rid of the tab bar and have it feel more like an "app", you can also <em>append</em> these to the Launch Options for Chrome: <code class="inline-code">--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://www.whateverserviceyouuse.com"</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a little demo of Fortnite on the Steam Deck, thanks to GeForce NOW:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0GfAjIPmFv4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78c162b3d6fde0bc3accb62afc7c39de.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0GfAjIPmFv4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>#100, woo-hoo! That's obviously great right. Performance of Fortnite on GFN however isn't amazing (quite stuttery), although I was testing out the Free plan over WiFi.</p>
<p><em>I should note, I am on the Steam Deck Beta branch, but that shouldn't change anything since the Flatpak package of Chrome will be the same since it's an external package.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a big Client update, plus Deck OS and BIOS BETA update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big updates arrived for the Steam Deck last night, so let's go over all that's changed as it's quite exciting. Firstly, the main Steam Deck Client update brings some really nice goodies.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="item-content">
<ul>
<li>Added dual trackpad typing support to onscreen keyboard</li>
<li>Added game mode onscreen keyboard to Desktop mode</li>
<li>Added Family Sharing status to game details page. Borrowers will see whose library they are borrowing from, and lenders will see a message if their library is currently in use by a borrower.</li>
<li>Added a Calibration and Advanced Settings screen with options for:
	<ul>
<li>Adjusting deadzones for the left and right Joysticks</li>
<li>Adjusting haptic strength for left and right Trackpads</li>
<li>Joysticks and other sensors on external gamepads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated network connection flow to connect without re-prompting for a known password</li>
<li>Improved performance downloading library images after logging in, leading to less stuttering</li>
<li>Removed display of 'B' back button in Overlay Quick Access Menu</li>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard input issues when connecting to public WiFi captive portals</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Chrome wouldn't install from the non-Steam section of the Library</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I know a lot of people preferred the dual-typing from the original Big Screen Mode, so it's quite pleasing to see Valve add that back in with the new Steam Deck on-screen keyboard. I have to say it looks pretty great in action too. Here's a quick video example with a bonus showing off some themes:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gwQjsIdCTko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d96421803f1cde8028ad0500e35c953b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gwQjsIdCTko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Having that same keyboard in Desktop Mode is also a great idea.</p>
<p>Here's where things get even more interesting though, as there's a Steam Deck OS and BIOS update also available in Beta. Some time ago, I discovered a charging issue with USB-C hubs and reached out to Valve about it. After a bit of back and forth, I ended up finding out that through some hotplugging — charging would work. It turned out that some hubs would pull power from the Deck, instead of a charging wire, and so you needed to plug the power into the hub first, then put the hub into the Deck. Valve were great on this, and they even picked up my exact model to reproduce it on their end. Doing some repeated testing today, it does seem to solve it.</p>
<p>Beta changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added messaging when a charger that doesn't meet the minimum bar is plugged in</li>
<li>Added uncapped framerate setting in Quick Access menu &gt; Performance</li>
<li>Added fTPM support, enabling Windows 11 installation</li>
<li>Added button combo: hold "..." + "Volume Down" to reset PD contract in the cases where Steam Deck gets stuck due to an incompatible Type-C device</li>
<li>Updated power LED to dim a few seconds after power supply connection events for better experience in dark environments</li>
<li>Improved compatibility for a number of Type-C docks and PSUs</li>
<li>Improved battery life in idle or very low usage scenarios</li>
<li>Improved stability</li>
<li>Fixed issues where the touchscreen does not work after some boots</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with some SD cards specifically when used as boot devices.</li>
<li>Fixed ACPI error spew in the kernel</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the OS + BIOS Beta, you need to opt into the Beta channel on the Steam Deck in the System settings menu (down near the bottom).</p>

      <title>Unity games crashing with Proton on Linux or Steam Deck? Check your USB devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: </strong>a fix for this is now available in Proton Experimental, so switch to that for now.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Curiously, it seems Proton 7 and Proton Experimental are having problems with Unity games recently but there's a possible temporary workaround for you. This is the same across Linux desktop and Steam Deck, as it's a problem somewhere with Proton.</p>
<p>Recently, while trying to capture footage from the Steam Deck for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube channel</a> I came up against a problem. Certain Unity games wouldn't load, and instead would present me with a Unity error screen with a loading bar and then just quit. There was a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5658" target="_blank">bug report open</a> from others also seeing a similar issue. Proton 6.3-8 would work but for some games, that had other issues that Proton 7 solved.</p>
<p>After some fiddling, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5658#issuecomment-1082029764" target="_blank">I eventually found out</a> that unplugging my Logitech Wireless Receiver suddenly made the games work. I tested this repeatedly, and yup — simply having that plugged in caused the problem. Even if a game is fully loaded and working, simply plugging it in would cause an instant crash. Others on the bug report have now confirmed it too, and it seems even some wired USB devices (from other vendors) are also seeing the same problem.</p>
<p>For now, switching to Proton 6.3-8 or unplugging devices will get Unity games to work again on Linux and Steam Deck. If you need a quick guide to swap Proton versions on Steam Deck, here's how to do it:</p>

      <title>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe launches April 27</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a long time after originally planned, The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is now confirmed to launch on April 27.</p>
<p>The developer says it's an "expanded re-imagining" of the original from 2013, which was a surprisingly amusing first-person exploration game. All of the original content is here but there's a big expansion with new content to explore, new choices and new secrets. It's also gone through a visual overhaul, added accessibility features, localization of in-game text and content warnings. Plus, the fab voice work of Kevan Brighting returns.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uv76dPXxfT8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78d1177036c87e1e816591a62b353e2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uv76dPXxfT8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers.<br/>
<br/>
You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1703340/The_Stanley_Parable_Ultra_Deluxe/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Arc Graphics launches for laptops, desktop GPUs later this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel Arc Graphics is finally here, as Intel officially enters the discrete GPU game and here's the details.</p>
<p>The first set is the Intel Arc A-series for laptops, with Arc 5 and Arc 7 coming in "early summer". Desktop / Workstation dedicated GPUs will be available sometime "later this year" with no clearer date yet being given. So unlike NVIDIA and AMD, they're not jumping in at the deep end first, doing a trickle roll-out starting at the lower end. This is an interesting step, which will enable them to really get their drivers in good shape before the possible masses flock towards their higher-end offerings later in the year.</p>

<p>Some of the features supported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel Xe Matrix Extensions</strong> <strong>(XMX) AI engines</strong> provide more compute capability for accelerating AI workloads. These AI engines have 16 times the compute to complete AI inferencing operations when compared to traditional GPU vector units, which can increase performance in productivity, gaming and creator applications.</li>
<li><strong>Xe Super Sampling</strong> <strong>(XeSS) </strong>is our solution that leverages the power of Intel Arc graphics’ XMX AI-engines to deliver high-performance, AI-accelerated upscaling. XeSS is a novel upscaling technology that uses deep learning to synthesize images that are very close to the quality of native high-res rendering. XeSS is coming in the summer and will be supported on all products with Arc A-Series graphics.</li>
<li>Intel Arc A-Series GPUs are the first in the industry to offer full <strong>AV1 hardware acceleration</strong>, including both encode and decode, delivering faster video encode and higher quality streaming while consuming the same internet bandwidth. We’ve worked with industry partners to ensure that AV1 support is available today in many of the most popular media applications, with broader adoption expected this year. The AV1 codec will be a game changer for the future of video encoding and streaming.</li>
<li>We’ve integrated <strong>Intel® Deep Link technologies</strong> to enable Intel Arc GPUs to work seamlessly with Intel CPUs and integrated graphics for a performance improvement across gaming, creating and streaming workloads. Intel Deep Link enables dynamic power sharing, intelligently distributing power across the platform to increase application performance up to 30% in creation and compute-intensive applications.1 With Hyper Encode and Hyper Compute, Deep Link allows multi-engine acceleration in transcoding and AI tasks. More details are available in our product fact sheet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the announcement, they also teased their first discrete desktop GPU in a limited edition:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15281229231648653711gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15281229231648653711gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2469445271648653713gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2469445271648653713gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>"Today marks the first step in our journey. You’ll see Intel Arc graphics continue to improve and evolve, with new features and an ever-expanding ecosystem coming throughout the year. And for desktop enthusiasts, our Intel Arc graphics add-in-cards will be coming this summer. We are excited, and we hope you are too. It’s going to be a big year for Intel Arc graphics." — Roger Chandler is vice president and general manager of Graphics and Gaming Team at Intel Corporation.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm excited. A third vendor properly jumping into it to mix things up, we've been stuck with just AMD or NVIDIA for far too long. Plus another vendor with open source drivers on Linux too, that's great. Some of the big main features will be supported on Linux too of course like Ray Tracing. As expected, all their testing and presentations are focused on Windows. When it comes to their new <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/arc-discrete-graphics/software/arc-control.html" target="_blank">Arc Control</a> software though, I doubt that will be supported on Linux, just like the other vendors don't give us their fancy control panels.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft Connect on Steam Deck guide with SD Card access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A guide that I've seen quite a few comments ask for across YouTube and our social media pages, so here's how to get the Ubisoft Connect launcher working on Steam Deck. You might want to do this if you own games on Ubisoft but not directly on Steam.</p>
<p>For this, I'm using my tried and tested method that I used for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">the Epic Games Store originally</a>, by adding the installer as a Non-Steam Game. You could also use Bottles, but I'll talk more about that later. First up, here's the video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9_p5jI2XWwc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/429cc938a2f43ac3a8ad9ed783a6cc7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9_p5jI2XWwc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into Desktop Mode. Power button - &gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
<li>Head to <a href="https://ubisoftconnect.com/en-GB/" target="_blank">Ubisoft Connect</a> and hit the big blue download button.</li>
<li>In your Steam Library, add a Non-Steam game and select the downloaded exe file from the Downloads folder.</li>
<li>Right click it in your Steam Library and go to Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the Force box and select Proton 7 or Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Then run it as normal and let it install.</li>
<li>Once installed, <em>don't</em> launch it. Right click on it in your Steam Library again and go -&gt; Properties -&gt; change the Target to the newly installed file. Do this by hitting Browse and go to "/home/deck/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/" and find the folder with a longer number than usual. You can also find the right one by expanding the box to see what folder was modified today. Then go into these folders to select the right exe file "/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher/UbisoftConnect.exe".</li>
</ol>
<p>For SD Card access, you also need one minor adjustment. In the same Properties menu, there's a Launch Options box, you need to add this into the text area: <code class="inline-code">STEAM_COMPAT_MOUNTS=/run/media/mmcblk0p1/ %command%</code></p>
<p>This tells Proton it can use the SD Card and where it is. Ensure the path is the <em>same</em> as <em>your</em> SD Card, you can find it listed as "Primary" in the Dolphin file manager at the bottom of the left panel.</p>
<p>A special <strong>important</strong> note: ensure you've set Ubisoft Connect to minimize when closed in the settings. In Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck, you need to quickly close Ubisoft Connect once you hit Play on a game, otherwise Gamescope (the SteamOS compositor) gets confused on what to display and madly <em>flashes</em> between the launcher and the game. A problem shared by many launchers right now. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: thanks to a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/ubisoft-connect-on-steam-deck-guide-with-sd-card-access/comment_id=223491" target="_blank">comment</a>, you can get Ubisoft Connect to auto-launch a specific game by adding uplay://launch/*gameID*/0 to the <u>end</u> of your Steam launch options for the app (ID <a href="https://github.com/Haoose/UPLAY_GAME_ID" target="_blank">list here</a>) which gets around the flashing issue but only works for a specific game at a time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The question is: why didn't I use Bottles like I showed for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-get-the-ea-app-on-steam-deck-with-bottles/" target="_blank">EA App on Steam Deck guide</a>? Well, I thought Ubisoft Connect was broken with Bottles but it's actually not so feel free to use that way instead. For some reason, Ubisoft Connect just takes a <em>very</em> long time to properly load in my account details (it's fine for others) but this is still a valid guide if you don't wish to use Bottles and prefer just directly using Steam and Proton together.</p>

      <title>Free and open source level editor LDtk 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LDtk (formerly known as LEd) is a free and open source level editor, developed by Sébastien Benard who previously worked on the successful Dead Cells and also recently Nuclear Blaze.</p>
<p>It's cross-platform too across Linux, macOS and Windows and with it being under the MIT license you can do mostly whatever you want with it. Although supporting the developer if you find it useful would of course be a good thing to do, if you wish to see it continued to be supported. Linux support is still considered "experimental", so perhaps with the source available issues can be found and fixed more easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10629908331648644377gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10629908331648644377gol1.jpg"/></a>Seems to run fine on Arch Linux.</em></p>
<p>What's new in 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>New entity reference system</li>
<li>Great performance boost for large projects</li>
<li>Integrated icons and many quality-of-life changes</li>
<li>New world layers</li>
<li>User interface reworks</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the key points of LDtk include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use - Every UI details were carefully designed to make the process of creating levels as smooth as possible.</li>
<li>Auto-rendering - Define some simple rules in a visual editor and let LDtk do the boring part of the skinning job for you.</li>
<li>World editor - Choose your world layout among “Grid-vania”, “linear”, or “free” and reorganize all your levels using plain old simple drag-n-drop.</li>
<li>Entities - Create your own game entities, with any custom (typed) properties, like “hit points”, a patrol path or an inventory of items.</li>
<li>Aseprite support - LDtk can load “*.aseprite” files directly, without any whatsoever intermediate PNG conversion. And with live-reloading support, you paint your tiles, save and LDtk updates everything accordingly, including image resizing.</li>
<li>Side &amp; top-downs - LDtk focuses on these perspectives to make sure the user experience feels just right. Sorry, no isometric here!</li>
<li>JSON - The app outputs a well documented JSON format that you can easily parse in your favorite game engine.</li>
<li>Tiled export - Tiled (TMX) optional export to try it out before implementing your own importer.</li>
<li>Backups - We know bad things can happen. LDtk offers a strong backup system and can even restore unsaved changes if the app crashes. Which shouldn’t happen, but we don’t live in a perfect world.</li>
<li>Pay what you want! - LDtk can be used for free without any limitation. But if you want to support my work, please consider buying it, or becoming a direct sponsor.</li>
<li>Optional Haxe API - If you are a Haxe user, you can benefit from a powerful and fully typed Haxe API, generated by macros as you type.</li>
</ul>

      <title>EmuDeck makes emulation on Steam Deck nice and simple</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to get emulation setup on Steam Deck, you need to take a look at <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> which makes installing and configuration nice and easy.</p>
<p>While the Steam Deck from Valve has already proven itself to be a very capable device (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">just look at our videos!</a>) for modern games, there's a massive amount of classics begging to be played on this handheld. This is where EmuDeck comes in. It's not an emulator itself though, instead it's a setup tool that helps you get other tools and emulators configured properly for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1137931351648635047gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1137931351648635047gol1.png"/></a>Pictured credit - EmuDeck developers</em></p>
<p>So what does it actually do? It will configure RetroArch, provide gamepad configs for Gamecube, Wii, special Steam Input setup for Cemu and Citra and a lot more systems. It will give you a bunch of pre-configured hotkeys, sort out the aspect ratio for certain systems, provide fancy game bezels for retro systems.</p>
<p>Not only that, it also hooks in with an app called Steam Rom Manager to properly sort out all the box art for adding games directly to the Steam Deck Gaming Mode UI, saving you a ton of time messing around with an manual art additions to your Steam Library. It even works directly with EmulationStation to provide everything it needs.</p>
<p>I was going to check it out in a video myself, but I'm not a fan of rehashing what others have done exceptionally well, so here's Retro Game Corps video on it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LIP-DF9K2SM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b5ddc94247a27fbcad3f5f67ae6affa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LIP-DF9K2SM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's really amazing to see purpose-built tools and scripts appear for the Steam Deck, which of course will likely work just fine on a Linux desktop too. The Steam Deck continues to be a big boon for Linux gaming as a whole.</p>

      <title>RetroArch gets big Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RetroArch, the very popular application front-end for emulators and more has a new release out and it includes better support for the Steam Deck. The improvements benefit all Steam users of course but, for the Steam Deck especially, it's awesome.</p>
<p>The devs mentioned they came up with a "shim" for SteamWorks that talks to the Steam API. What they've done is create a bridge between RetroArch Steam and their middleware tool called Mist that runs on a separate process. The result is that it remains compliant with the GPL license but allows more flexibility. As a result, these are now possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can now install and uninstall cores directly from inside RetroArch by going to ‘Manage Cores’ from inside the menu. No longer do you have to manually browse Steam with your webbrowser and download random core DLCs for RetroArch, you can do it from within the convenience of the app running itself.</li>
<li>On Steam Deck, the native OSK (Onscreen Keyboard) will appear now instead of the RetroArch default OSK. This should give a more seamless experience. We have decided against enabling the Steam OSK with Big Picture since it seems partially broken and instantly dismisses itself (or at least those were our testing results on a Steam Deck).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All that and more can be seen in the release notes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1118310/view/3101298165296698017" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Emulation on Steam Deck just keeps getting better, and there's another great project I'll be highlighting shortly for those who want an easy setup of many emulation systems on the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a classic base-building RTS out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a new Early Access real-time strategy game from Wield Interactive / The Knights of Unity, as a much expanded version of the original that's free on itch.io.</p>
<p>Inspired by the development and decline of historical civilizations, players must maintain a delicate balance between food production and army upkeep, as reducing food sources can collapse even the most powerful community. The developers say it's a tribute to the pioneers of the RTS genre and you can certainly feel that while playing. If you've ever played a base-building RTS before (be it Age of Empires or anything similar), you will absolutely feel at home here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z6qLkWwHx4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02477f4d339ac25c54e11aec5b3f3e1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z6qLkWwHx4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The pixel-art on this is great too and a little unusual to see for such an RTS. That's not all that sets it apart though, with the Food system being part of what makes it both great and challenging. See food here is not just to build units, it's also for upkeep and so keeping a healthy amount of incoming food and a surplus is a must. Want to really screw with an opponent? Hit and run attacks on farms are great.</p>
<p>With the initial release out now it offers single-player Skirmish battles, a Horde mode and full online multiplayer right away so there's plenty to enjoy with more game modes in development. Development during Early Access will continue for at least one year.</p>
<p>I especially liked the Horde mode myself, given that my own way of playing RTS games ends up as "Turtling" it suits me perfectly building up a big defensive barrier and gathering a great army. Overall, this is brilliant entry into the strategy genre that I can't wait to see evolve.</p>
<p>Available in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Simfest: Hobby Edition is live until April 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love games that emulate a job or a hobby, this is the event for you. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/simfest_hobby" target="_blank">Steam Simfest: Hobby Edition</a> is live until April 4.</p>
<p>Another event for you to jump in, find some demos and there's plenty of discounts on games that are already available too. During the last few days of the event (April 1 - 4), there will also be a whole bunch of official talks and discussions taking place which will be live on the event page and likely directly on game pages on Steam.</p>
<p>Not all games are on sale though, the event as a whole is just to bring attention to some of these games and help developers find a bigger audience.</p>
<p>Some of the games on sale that I found to be interesting include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/415200/Motorsport_Manager/" target="_blank">Motorsport Manager</a> - 85% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/" target="_blank">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> - 75% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/535930/Two_Point_Hospital/" target="_blank">Two Point Hospital</a> - 75% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600480/Megaquarium/" target="_blank">Megaquarium</a> - 60% off</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/" target="_blank">Escape Simulator</a> - 20% off</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the highlighted games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/" target="_blank">PowerWash Simulator</a> (not discounted), seems quite amusing in a weirdly satisfying way. As the name suggests, it's all about washing away the dirt to get that sparkly finish. It runs great with Steam Play Proton on Linux and it's Steam Deck Verified, so here's a quick look at it running on Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q2irynLam4A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8eac5d1dc3a57d372f5961d67255207.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q2irynLam4A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's thoroughly odd how you can get so easily lost in such a game, it completely absorbed my attention. This might be my new favourite game to play on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Vulkan API 1.3.210 out with new extensions, new NVIDIA Beta Driver ready</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today a new version of Vulkan was tagged and in addition to the usual documentation additions, there's two new extensions that are quite interesting. NVIDIA as usual have a new Beta driver for Linux ready.</p>
<p>Here's the two new extensions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This extension allows the separate compilation of four distinct parts of graphics pipelines, with the intent of allowing faster pipeline loading for applications reusing the same shaders or state in multiple pipelines. Each part can be independently compiled into a graphics pipeline library, with a final link step required to create an executable pipeline that can be bound to a command buffer.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This was worked on by developers from Valve, Unity, AMD, Google, Arm, NVIDIA, Roblox, Gameloft, Mobica, Ubisoft and Qualcomm. Being able to split things up and re-use them sound quite useful! Dan Ginsburg from Valve wrote a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">big blog post</a> on the official Khronos Group website about the work and integrating it into the Source 2 Engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This extension adds support for a new query type to match OpenGL's GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED to support layering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should be useful for the Zink driver that does OpenGL over Vulkan. Developed by Collabora, Arm, NVIDIA and Google.</p>
<p>As for the NVIDIA driver <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">version 470.62.26</a> was released in their Vulkan Beta series, which is aimed primarly at developers so gamers should stick to their mainline drivers. As for Mesa with AMD / Intel, it looks like some merge requests have appeared towards getting them working too for open source drivers (<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;state=all&amp;search=VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;state=all&amp;search=VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_libraries" target="_blank">#2</a>).</p>

      <title>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti &#39;BFGPU&#39; has rolled out </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a lot of spare cash? NVIDIA want you to part with it. Today they've released the ridiculous monster that is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. With a price starting at $1,999 it's not going to be a card for regular consumers at all, more for those who want power without compromises.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="description color-white body-text">
<p>The GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is for our most ambitious users - those building research systems for data science and AI, or processing large data sets, and those making massive projects in creative applications. Or maybe you’re a developer or CG animator working with detailed models, super high resolution textures and massive sets.</p>
<p>If you simply want to game, extreme enthusiasts can enjoy max setting 4K, ray-traced gameplay at the fastest speeds possible, and even 8K NVIDIA DLSS-accelerated gaming on displays that support 8K 60Hz as specified in HDMI 2.1.</p>

<p>Compared with previous cards, NVIDIA said it is "up to 60% faster than the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and 55% faster than the TITAN RTX". Here's a comparison for you based on a couple of previous models:</p>

      <title>The Planet Crafter is a great start to a open-world terraforming game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/" target="_blank">The Planet Crafter</a> is a lonely and chilled-out open-world survival game about terraforming a hostile planet. It works great on Linux with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, although due to a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5658" target="_blank">bug</a> with Unity games, I had to set it to Proton 6.8.</p>
<p>Some have already started calling it Subnautica on Mars, and it's not a bad description of it. It's not been out long but it's already jumped up to an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating. Not surprising though really, since it performs really well and the idea is great. A little basic in a number of ways mechanically but it's so sleek it doesn't really matter, it does it all quite well.</p>
<p>On the Linux side with Proton, performance has been consistently well above 100FPS and 99% of the time it remains incredibly smooth while exploring too. Here's a few minutes of the beginning section as I was trying to figure it out:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m5cVXybTcFE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d46397f816c515989f788d00cd0167f5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m5cVXybTcFE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm planning to explore a lot more of this one, as it seems like there's plenty of secrets hiding as it really doesn't guide you. Offering up some basic "craft this" instructions, the rest is up to you to explore and figure out and in this case — I quite like the mystery of it all. Could be a great Steam Deck title if they properly hook up Steam Input for gamepads.</p>
<p>If you're after a new game to explore a strange new world and get crafting, looks like The Planet Crafter is a good one to check out. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Early Access, which the developer says it will stay there for for at least a year (possibly two) depending on feedback. It also has a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1830840/The_Planet_Crafter_Prologue/" target="_blank">Prologue</a> demo you can try too.</p>

      <title>More teasers for a big Valheim update have arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm honestly quite hyped for the Mistlands update to Valheim, although it's some time away still yet the teasers are great. Iron Gate released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3126067963236733079" target="_blank">another post</a> recently giving out just a wee bit more information, plus some shots and a video to keep your appetites in check.</p>
<p>They said their team are "fully focused on creating the Mistlands" with new "creatures are given life, dungeons are being planned out, and weapons are being crafted". The new Mistlands Biome is a big task for Iron Gate and they said it still requires a lot of work. Here's the Mistlands teaser concept art:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15224191851648549392gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15224191851648549392gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Seems like we're also going to be seeing a crossbow!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11256030321648549417gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11256030321648549417gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A teaser video of a new Bow was also included:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HyW-eKxgnxk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/906a63aa93854d76619b01e3e97bfb00.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HyW-eKxgnxk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That's it for now. I'll be keep a close eye on Valheim as always. Once the Mistlands update is out, I'm definitely going to be starting a new world. Perhaps even some more livestreams of it on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Twitch channel</a>!</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard is a retro point and click adventure worth trying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard is a very promising upcoming point and click adventure game, with a Linux demo available.</p>
<p>Developed by German-based WatchDaToast, it started off as a passion project that they've ended spending four years crafting into an adventure inspired by LucasArts and Sierra point &amp; click classics. They said part of their plan for it is to return the genre to the "adventure" aspect, so it places some emphasis on exploring as well as inventory-based puzzles. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZO6llGyqUYg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/417e36c2f9fb40e595f4ac489e415e3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZO6llGyqUYg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive story told through hand-drawn landscapes and countless animations!</li>
<li>A return to the “adventure” aspect of the genre – a big focus on exploring whimsical places, uncovering secrets, and dealing with tense and dangerous situations</li>
<li>Cinematic cutscenes, reminiscent of hand-drawn animated movies, mixed with a pixel art aesthetic</li>
<li>Atmospheric soundtrack, inspired by the old midi classics everyone knows and loves</li>
<li>6-8 hours of gameplay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1771383285/beyond-the-edge-of-owlsgard" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the goal already having been met. So it's been added to our Crowdfunding Tracker Page. There's also a demo on <a href="https://watchdatoast.itch.io/beyond-the-edge-of-owlsgard" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1709730/Beyond_The_Edge_Of_Owlsgard/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire fan expansion Downfall flips the game and lets you be the monsters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Downfall - A Slay the Spire Fan Expansion (the full name), is a bit of a mouthful but it's also spilling over the side with features. So much so, that it got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865780/Downfall__A_Slay_the_Spire_Fan_Expansion/" target="_blank">Steam release</a> outside the workshop — you still need to own Slay the Spire though of course as it's a big mod.</p>
<p>Slay the Spire is still easily one of the best deck-builders around, and now with this free fan expansion out, it's even better. You get access to a full new character for the Standard game mode, and then for the new Downfall game mode there's a bunch of Villain characters. Currently there's seven of them to pick from, with more on the way. Gameplay is flipped too, with you going down the Spire instead of up. Finally taking the fight to the heroes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14944826091648461049gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14944826091648461049gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot to this expansion includes new Relics, Potions, special 'Boss' cards, a large collection of Events, Curses, Daily Run Modifiers and the list goes on. It's absolutely huge and definitely worth a go.</p>
<p>Slay the Spire is available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/slay-the-spire?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Portal 2: Desolation is looking great in the graphics overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Portal 2: Desolation is an upcoming community-made Portal game, created by fans in tribute to Valve's iconic series and it's going to look pretty fancy.</p>
<p>The team has been toiling away to push what they can do with the Source engine, and they've now "completely replaced" the rendering and lighting pipeline. They did this due to some issues with the way Source originally did it, and the new physically-based renderer gives them completely real-time lighting. They also get a lot more flexibility, enabling "lights to move and change color/intensity in the level, making it possible for us to choreograph more sophisticated, dynamic scenes with lighting". With this they also upgraded reflections, shadows, rebuilt some core Portal 2 assets to increase fidelity and much more. It's safe to say it's incredibly ambitious and hopefully players will enjoy it.</p>

      <title>The Dota 2 &#39;Spring Cleaning&#39; update for 2022 makes muting and reporting easier</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dota 2 has a very lively community, and sadly often you will come across some attitudes that just aren't friendly and now Valve has made it simpler to deal with them in-game.</p>
<p>There's now a single button that gives you access to mute voice, text and report a player all from the same little screen. A very useful change. There's also a quick way to mute an entire team if they're a problem. It's a shame such things are needed but welcome changes from Valve there.</p>
<p>Not only that, Valve also announced changes to how they will handle communication reports. They said "Our goals are to make it quick and easy to mute disruptive players while also getting a clear indication of which players we might need to take stronger action on".</p>
<p>Learning the game should be a bit easier now too, with a big upgrade to the Hero demo area to include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The northern section of the Demo Map has been expanded to provide more flat area for testing.</li>
<li>Added controls to easily spawn Allied heroes, in addition to enemies.</li>
<li>Added a control to reset a hero back to level 1.</li>
<li>Added a control to remove a hero once you're done testing.</li>
<li>Buttons for leveling, adding Scepter, adding Shard, and toggling invulnerability now apply to all currently selected heroes.</li>
<li>When toggling creeps off all existing lane creeps will be destroyed.</li>
<li>Added a button to spawn a single creep wave from each side.</li>
<li>Added buttons to spawn the 6 major runes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some performance improvements also arrived too. Valve said they tweaked the "Panorama UI engine to use atlassing to more efficiently interact with the GPU" which "resulted in 25-30% better performance in the GPU work necessary for the HUD" so those using the Vulkan API should see an increase in CPU performance.</p>

      <title>100% Orange Juice gets Steam Deck Verified thanks to supporting Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's another developer who upgraded their game ready for the Steam Deck, with the popular 100% Orange Juice. <em><u>ICYMI</u>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-closing-in-on-2000-games-rated-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">we're close to 2,000 titles rated either Verified or Playable</a>.</em></p>
<p>What is it? 100% Orange Juice is a digital multiplayer board game populated by developer Orange Juice's all-star cast. Characters from Flying Red Barrel, QP Shooting, Suguri and Sora come together with all-new characters to duke it out... with dice.</p>
<p>Back in late February, it got an upgrade that touched on many parts of the game but also hooked up Steam Input to support a wide variety of controllers. Just two days ago, it got bumped up to a fully Steam Deck Verified status and the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/282800/announcements/detail/3115934864084540617" target="_blank">announced</a> "As soon as we got our hands on the device, we felt it'll be great for playing 100% Orange Juice, so we worked hard to make the game fully compatible using various control schemes (in the process, Steam Input support was added for playing with other controllers as well)".</p>

<p>Can't say I had heard of it until recently but it's clearly popular, with over 12,000 user reviews on Steam and a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dice, cards, stars, battles and pudding</li>
<li>4 Single-player campaigns</li>
<li>Playable by up to 4 players online</li>

      <title>Steam Next Fest returns in June to overload you with demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest: June Edition 2022</a> is confirmed to be launching on June 13, so time to make sure you have some space free to install all those demos.</p>
<p>I've managed to find a few new favourites from previous events, so here's to hoping there's plenty. Hopefully developers will be getting more of their games with Steam Input support too, since many more people will be playing on a Steam Deck. This time there might even be a special section just for those.</p>
<p>Valve even included a little "rejected" rhyme from Kaci Aitchison in their press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Next Fest in June, this here is your memo</p>
<p>To mark down the dates to try hundreds of demos</p>
<p>There will be lots of livestreams- we say there'll be oodles</p>
<p>For the sake of this rhyme, they might go well with noodles. (Poodles?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Well, okay then, that's one way to get my attention I guess.</em></p>
<p>You can head to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">official page</a> to setup a reminder. Steam Next Fest: June 2022 Edition starts June 13 at 10AM PT / 5PM UTC and runs through until June 20.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck closing in on 2,000 games rated Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Deck is getting close to hitting a pretty big milestone, with nearly 2,000 games rated Verified or Playable. Considering it only released just over a month ago, it's a pretty sweet place to be for Valve's handheld.</p>
<p>Not without issues though, with some games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-gathering-a-list-of-deck-verified-games-that-have-problems/" target="_blank">not really having</a> the correct rating which Valve now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">wants feedback</a> on with their new system. Still, it seems like the vast majority are being given a rating that fits in well. Here's the latest numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>999 - Verified</li>
<li>913 - Playable</li>
<li>930 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more recent games to receive a rating include: CARRION (Verified), We Happy Few (Verified), Aliens: Colonial Marines (Playable), Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ (Verified), Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch™ Remastered (Verified), Tom Clancy's The Division (Playable), Stoneshard (Playable), Heavy Rain (Verified), Wolfenstein: The New Order (Verified), Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (Verified).</p>
<p>One that doesn't make sense is DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2, which got a Verified rating by Valve, even though online doesn't work due to Easy Anti-Cheat which the original developer has not turned on for Linux / Steam Deck. Good job they have that new feedback system huh?</p>
<p>It looks like Valve has made a small adjustment to the way games go through Deck Verified now too, with <a href="http://steamdb.info" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> noting a new field named "gamescope_frame_limiter_not_supported". This is possibly as a result of a <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/issues/439" target="_blank">bug I logged</a>, as some games don't work at all with the frame limiter in the performance menu of the Steam Deck (usually OpenGL titles).</p>

      <title>DXVK 1.10.1 is out with initial support for shared resources</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK </a>is the free and open source project that translates Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan for use with the Wine and Proton Windows translation layers. One of the major parts of <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> that helps games run well on Linux desktops and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Version 1.10.1 brings on initial support for shared resources, fixing video playback in a number of Koei Tecmo games (Atelier series, Nioh 2), as well as the D3D11-based UI in the Windows version of Black Mesa. It's still quite experimental now and needs more testing across various drivers.</p>
<p>Some of the other fixes and improvements includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an environment variable <code class="inline-code">DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI</code> to bypass the vendor ID override. Setting it to <code class="inline-code">1</code> behaves exactly the same as setting <code class="inline-code">dxvk.nvapiHack = False</code> in the config file, but may allow for better integration into Lutris or the Proton launch script. (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2544" target="_blank">#2544</a>)</li>
<li>Improved shader code generation when local arrays are used. This may improve performance on Nvidia drivers in some D3D11 games.</li>
<li>Fixed shader code generation when switch-case fallthrough is used in Shader Model 4.0 (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2556" target="_blank">#2556</a>). Current FXC versions no longer generate such code.</li>
<li>Potentially improved performance when rendering to <code class="inline-code">DXGI_FORMAT_R11G11B10_FLOAT</code> images that can also be used with unordered access views.</li>
<li>Fixed various D3D9 issues related to texture uploads (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2559" target="_blank">#2559</a>, <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2541" target="_blank">#2541</a>, <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2535" target="_blank">#2535</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Assassin's Creed 3</strong>, <strong>Black Flag</strong>: Enabled <code class="inline-code">d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = a</code> to work around severe performance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Frostpunk</strong>: Enabled <code class="inline-code">d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = c</code> to work around low CPU-bound performance.</li>
<li><strong>God of War</strong>: Fixed some issues that started with game patch 1.0.9:
	<ul>
<li>Extremely inconsistent frame pacing when the game detects an AMD GPU, <code class="inline-code">dxgi.maxFrameLatency = 1</code> is now set by default to work around this issue.</li>
<li>Heavy flickering of some lights. Apparently this was also fixed in the game in patch 1.0.11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GTA: San Andreas</strong>: Fixed UI rendering issues (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2560" target="_blank">#2560</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Rayman Origins</strong>: Fixed rendering issues (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2545" target="_blank">#2545</a>)</li>

      <title>Valve actually announced Steam for Chrome OS now too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announces-steam-for-chromeos-chromebooks-in-alpha/" target="_blank">false start</a> with an announcement made too early, Google has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/" target="_blank">now announced</a> Steam for Chrome OS and Chromebooks and now Valve has done their own brief announcement. So it's all <em>officially official</em> now.</p>
<p>From Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3128319763053339627" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of Monday this week, an early version of Steam for Chrome OS has been made available to developers. Google and Valve have been collaborating on this project, which will ship to end users sometime in the future. Because Chrome OS is a Linux-based operating system, it can leverage much of the work that Valve has recently done for Steam Deck to allow games to run well even when they don't have a native Linux build. Google engineers have worked to greatly expand the capability of Chrome OS to make this possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like for Steam Deck, Valve has made it clear that developers don't actually <em>need</em> to test their own games, as it's "up to Google and Valve to make sure compatibility for Chrome OS is as robust as possible". That said, nothing stops developers ensuring their native Linux builds are in good shape or testing their Windows builds with Proton on a Linux desktop / Steam Deck. If developers do test, they can report issues directly to <a href="mailto:borealis-game-dev@google.com" target="_blank">borealis-game-dev@google.com</a>.</p>
<p>Again, this is fantastic news for Linux gaming as a whole because Steam on Chrome OS is the Linux client. This gives developers more of a reason to care about Linux (on top of Steam Deck), and gives Valve another reason to keep the Linux client in good shape.</p>

      <title>Syncthing is a great way to transfer files from PC to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-transfer-files-from-your-pc-to-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">I did a guide</a> using the Warpinator tool to transfer files from PC to Steam Deck, here's another way using the wonderful tool Syncthing that you might prefer.</p>
<p>A lot of people seemed to like the previous guide and video, however a few people couldn't get Warpinator to work although most did. So as a bonus, I checked out Syncthing to see how that works. It's just as easy to get going too. First up, here's a video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nzix6-uKTA0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/057b8b75e60a9931a656af44b78fd73f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nzix6-uKTA0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One reason this tool might be better overall, is that it will continually sync when online so it might be useful for many other things like syncing saved games for those that don't have Steam Cloud and more.</p>
<p>Text guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Syncthing (it's free and open source)
	<ul>
<li>Linux / Steam Deck: install Syncthing from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/me.kozec.syncthingtk" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. Available in the Discover software centre for Plasma.</li>
<li>Windows: head to <a href="https://syncthing.net/downloads/" target="_blank">this site</a> to download it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load up Syncthing on both systems. You can keep hitting next on the setup, as the defaults are fine.</li>
<li>On one system, hit the little COG icon and click on Show ID. Make a note of the ID (I used the Saved Messaged feature on <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank">Telegram</a> to just easily copy between system).</li>
<li>On your other device, hit the COG icon and select Add Device and paste the ID in. Click Save once you're happy with the options and shared folders.</li>
<li>Back to your other device, Syncthing will have an in-app message bar appear, click Add and in a moment or two it will show up.</li>
<li>Now simply add files to your synced folder(s) and they will appear on the other device.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get some questions out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>KDE Connect does not come pre-installed and doesn't have a proper Flatpak package for Linux / Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Yes, there's other ways to do it including sftp/ftp but this is a <em>simple</em> way anyone can follow.</li>
<li>There are browser-based solutions but they're much slower.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). A new development release is out with Wine 7.5. It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ALSA driver converted to PE.</li>
<li>Locale database generated from Unicode CLDR.</li>
<li>HLSL compiler support with the bundled vkd3d.</li>
<li>Initial support for the OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol).</li>
<li>More cleanups to support 'long' type.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>28 bugs were noted to be solved as of this release, some older and some new including: Minecraft (Windows 10 edition), GRID 2, The Evil Within 2, DYSMANTLE and various other miscellaneous fixes.</p>

      <title>Looks like Valve are adding a feedback system for Steam Deck Verified (update: it&#39;s live)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: shortly after, Valve officially <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3131696829170735771" target="_blank">announced</a> this new system and it's live now. Valve confirmed they can already grab data on things like crashes but this new opt-in system is to gather more info on the "overall experience". They also said the "data collected by this system won't directly change the Deck compatibility category for a title". So they're not crowdsourcing the compatibility process but checking to see if their process is working well or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/261908011648236801gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/261908011648236801gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18174026651648236800gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18174026651648236800gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This is what else has rolled out today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added alert to Steam letting reservation holders know they can purchase a Steam Deck, as well as how much time is remains in their order window</li>
<li>Added support for advanced filters and dynamic collection collection to Library</li>
<li>Added "View in Library" or "View in Store" to event items (like achievements earned) in the activity feed</li>
<li>Updated layout and navigation for Community pages to fully support gamepad navigation</li>
<li>Updated text on Download page to clarify when player is downloading a patch vs an initial download</li>
<li>Updated localization</li>
<li>Updated Controller Configurator navigation</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Keyboard theme not updating properly when equipped directly from the Points Shop</li>
<li>Fixed "Skip Shaders" button not working properly on game launch screen</li>
<li>Fixed some focus issues using L1/R1 on tab rows</li>
<li>Fixed some stalls on resume for users who own many, many games</li>
<li>Fixed long loading times after logging in for users who own many, many games</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>An eagle-eyed reader in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> pointed out that it appears Valve are working to bring out a feedback system for Steam Deck Verified. We can see this thanks to all the work SteamDB does with their SteamTracking system, with a <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/compare/429727c97107...d858d0a084b8#diff-9bc56656e94fa330fe991d6d1268116dde012eed6416baa0c60b27599f2ab176R1928" target="_blank">new update</a> they found showing off some new language strings that will be used on Steam.</p>
<p>Some of the new strings are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SteamDeckVerified_Feedback_Question": "Does this match your experience playing the game?",<br/>
"SteamDeckVerified_Feedback_Agree": "Yes",<br/>
"SteamDeckVerified_Feedback_Disagree": "No",<br/>
"SteamDeckVerified_Feedback_Ignore": "Ignore",<br/>
"SteamDeckVerified_Feedback_Confirmation": "Thank you for the feedback.",<br/>
"SteamDeckVerified_Feedback_Confirmation_Ignore": "Gotcha, we won't ask you anymore questions about %1$s.",<br/>
"SteamDeckFeedback_UserPrefence_Question": "Can we occasionally ask you for feedback?  Your input will help us improve Steam Deck.",<br/>
"SteamDeckFeedback_UserPrefence_Yes": "Yes",<br/>
"SteamDeckFeedback_UserPrefence_No": "No Thanks",<br/>
"SteamDeckFeedback_UserPrefence_LearnMore": "Learn More",</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes it pretty clear that we're going to see a system of questions, to see if the experience matches up with the current Deck Verified rating for a game. Something that's definitely needed, as there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-gathering-a-list-of-deck-verified-games-that-have-problems/" target="_blank">numerous issues</a> with the current way games are going through this verifying system.</p>
<p>Seeing this makes me quite happy, and shows clearly how Valve want to make the best of it and keep improving.</p>

      <title>Valve gathering a list of Deck Verified games that have problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On Steam, one of the official Valve-picked moderators of the Steam Deck hub has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3186865924592128220/" target="_blank">a new post up</a> they've pinned to gather information on problematic Steam Deck Verified titles.</p>
<p>There's been an increasing amount of reports of titles that are either Verified or Playable, that really shouldn't be. More people get their Steam Deck each week, and so we do expect this problem to continue growing since the amount of games on Steam is massive. Game porter and software developer Ethan Lee even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/how-valve-can-make-the-deck-verified-program-better/" target="_blank">wrote an editorial here</a> on some issues and suggestions for Valve too.</p>
<p>Some of the games being reported in that post (and elsewhere) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atelier Ryza 2 - "Verified" but reportedly doesn't save your graphics settings, and the defaults don't perform well.</li>
<li>A Way Out - "Playable" but the resolution is cropped to the middle of the screen, and it sometimes doesn't load.</li>
<li>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - "Playable" but gamepad input apparently not working.</li>
<li>Call of Juarez: Gunslinger - "Verified" but videos don't play.</li>
<li>Deathloop - "Verified" but multiple complaints of poor performance, and reportedly some users say suspend makes it crash.</li>
<li>DOOM (2016) - "Verified" and yet there's reports of it repeatedly crashing through the game.</li>
<li>ELDERBORN - "Verified" but repeatedly freezes.</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V (my report) - "Playable" but I talked about some of the problems of getting it working <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-verified-has-issues-grand-theft-auto-v-edition/" target="_blank">in an article</a>, the current version of Proton tagged has major problems with the launcher not working.</li>
<li>HITMAN - "Verified" but gamepad input not working. Another said it causes the Deck to reboot.</li>
<li>Hoa - "Verified" but some of the movies are broken.</li>
<li>Luck be a Landlord - "Verified" but doesn't even have gamepad support at all and mouse / touchscreen input is problematic.</li>
<li>Monkey Island 2 Special Edition - "Playable" but a menu keeps popping up making it not really playable.</li>
<li>Nuclear Throne (I can confirm this too) - "Verified" but gamepad input doesn't work with the default configuration. After testing this one more myself, having seen the report on the issues, it sort-of detects the Deck with it set to keyboard / mouse input but not properly and it's certainly not playable. It also likes to give you a tiny resolution.</li>
<li>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time - "Verified" but does not recognise gamepad input, a message box comes up asking about safe mode that needs touchscreen input and it needs a manual bring-up of the keyboard.</li>
<li>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Complete Edition - "Playable" but has distorted menu audio and in-game doesn't work as the screen flickers between the game and a test screen.</li>
<li>SHENZHEN I/O - "Verified" but doesn't work. It's currently set to use Proton but the Native Linux version works, this one is due for a retest as part of their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/valve-clarifies-how-they-test-native-linux-or-proton-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">original problem</a> of not verifying the native build first. But still, how did it get Verified like that when it doesn't work?</li>
<li>Sonic Generations - "Verified" but has poor performance, some parts can drop to single digit FPS.</li>
<li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth - "Verified" but one user reports it crashing on launch. Works fine for me however.</li>
<li>Vampire Survivors (my report) - "Verified" but performance will go down to single digit FPS at the most important parts of the game at the last 5 minutes of each level. The developer is even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3131696199131643254" target="_blank">fully aware</a>, with a port to a new game engine happening but that's not due until at least the "Summer".</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing to remember, as with all crowdsourced reports, is that expectations and details on what is and isn't working correctly will vary but I think even this small slice shows how Deck Verified needs improvements. Given there's now 1,699 titles at Verified and Playable, Valve really need to get this right to keep trust in the system.</p>
<p>Have you found issues that aren't noted for Verified and Playable games on Steam Deck? Might be a good idea to add a post and let us know here in the comments too.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA working with Valve to get Gamescope working on their drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, as an NVIDIA developer has confirmed that work is in progress to get <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> working with their drivers.</p>
<p>Gamescope, for those not aware, is a Wayland compositor originally forked from the older SteamOS 2 compositor. It's a big part of what makes Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck do all it can. This includes features like scaling, AMD FSR, frame rate limiting and more. It would be great to see it fully working across more vendors, especially for those gaming on multiple monitors as it can help get around some troubles there too.</p>
<p>However, it only really works with AMD / Intel GPUs (Mesa) right now but that is set to change. On the NVIDIA forum, developer amrits <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/request-for-gamescope-and-the-vk-ext-image-drm-format-modifier/208614/3" target="_blank">confirmed</a> "We are working with Valve to ensure Gamescope runs well on our driver." and linked to a <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/454" target="_blank">GitHub</a> request to fix up issues with it to have it work on the NVIDIA driver.</p>

      <title>AMD reveal more on FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 (FSR)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With GDC ongoing, there's lots of info flying out from developers and hardware vendors and now AMD has given talks and more detail on FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0. If you need a quick primer, see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-20-announced/" target="_blank">our original post from the initial announcement</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main things is that it might be more difficult to integrate for developers. It requires developers provide it with more data points but AMD say it will be easier to integrate with games that "already have a temporal upscaling rendering path". They estimate if that rendering path exists it could be "as little as a few days" to integrate FSR 2.0.</p>
<p>Along with some updated screenshots they gave out a trickle of new info. Here's one of the new comparison shots, click it to enlarge it (warning - large file size):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6279101831648144775gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6279101831648144775gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It will support various quality modes just like FSR 1.0, here's what they've changed to for FSR 2.0:</p>

<p>As for hardware support, as they already announced it continues to be cross-vendor and cross-platform too. Since it's now an "advanced temporal upscaling solution" it will be a little more demanding to use.</p>

      <title>Kickstart RT from NVIDIA makes Ray Tracing integration in games easier</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At GDC the NVIDIA team had plenty of announcement, most of them not interesting to us but <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/kickstart" target="_blank">Kickstart RT</a> definitely jumps out. A new SDK under the open source MIT license allowing game engine developers and games to integrate Ray Tracing a lot easier.</p>
<p>NVIDIA say it's the "one stop shop" when it comes to adding "real-time ray-traced reflections, shadows, ambient occlusion and global illumination under one umbrella". Available cross-API and cross-platform with support for Vulkan, Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12. Plus, support for Linux and Windows too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This SDK aims to achieve higher quality reflection and GI rendering than traditional screen space techniques, using hardware ray-tracing functionality without having to set up shaders and shader resources for ray-tracing.</p>
<p>When implementing ray-tracing into an existing game engine, one of the biggest problems is preparing the shaders for reflection and GI rays. All of the countless shaders that exist in a game scene must be listed and configured. We also need to make sure that the various shader resources (ConstantBuffer, Texture, etc.) can be accessed correctly from those shaders for each material. This can be a very complex task.</p>
<p>Instead of setting up all the shaders, this SDK takes the lighting information from a rendered G-Buffer and stores it in a world space cache. Therefore, the application does not need to modify any shaders for ray-tracing. Internally, the SDK creates reflection and GI information by sampling the lighting information using ray-tracing. This is the biggest difference from screen space based techniques as lighting information for off-screen objects will also be sampled if it is stored in the SDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they also make it clear it's not a complete and direct replacement for ray-traced reflections or GI. It comes with some compromises like not taking the material of a surface into account and some latency involved due to the way it works and how it gets updated lighting information.</p>
<p>Kickstart RT is available on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/KickstartRT" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Story: "The year is 3796, and you are Caroline. A bloodthirsty, psychopathic mercenary who wants nothing more than to marry her wonderful boyfriend Athens Fetter. Problem is money's tight, and rings aren't exactly cheap. But thankfully there may be hope for her yet, as a warlock named Cromune has acquired a rather hefty bounty on his head. He's being accompanied by a small fraction of the U.S.C. (The United Scientific Conglomerate) Lead by Dr Mortice. Which means he's got a small army defending him. But what's an army to someone who's taken on a legion? What're a few hundred soldiers to death incarnate? Nothing but a slaughter... Nay... A viscerafest."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Slaughter</strong> over 2 dozen different enemy types, from the minor grunts who make up the U.S.C's forces, to monsters beyond your ability to comprehend such as The Soul Hunters. New enemy types are introduced every level, each compounding the challenges you'll face with a variety of attacks and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Juggle</strong> your resources, as you fight to stay alive, constantly balancing your use of ammo, health, and armor.</li>
<li><strong>Move</strong> at the speed of light, chaining bunny hopping and dashing together to move at speeds no man would dream of, and with your overbearing air control, dance around projectiles like no other.</li>
<li><strong>Collect</strong> tons of goodies to unlock items such as Cypher keys, and level modifiers to spice up your playthroughs.</li>

      <title>Shattered Pixel Dungeon arrives on Steam eight years later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After working on it for eight years and being available on other platforms, Shattered Pixel Dungeon has officially released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769170/Shattered_Pixel_Dungeon/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with Linux support.</p>
<p>"Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler RPG with pixel art graphics. Every game is a unique challenge, with four different playable characters, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. The game is simple to get into, but strategy is required if you want to win!"</p>
<p>Quite a sweet game actually, and it's clear the developer has put a lot of love and thought into this one, feels like a nicely rounded dungeon crawling experience not to be missed. It is massive on mobile platforms, with close to one hundred thousand reviews on Google Play and a very high rating so it's great to see it land on desktop in an enhanced form. Yet again, I fear for my free time because it's brilliant in its simplicity and yet there's loads to it.</p>

      <title>Ion Fury: Aftershock expansion gets delayed with no set date now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Voidpoint has confirmed that while they're deep in development on Ion Fury: Aftershock, it won't be releasing soon.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/562860/view/3122689629911497250" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, they mentioned how "unforeseen delays have pushed back the release beyond our initial projections, but we're committed to not sacrificing quality in order to hit any specific deadline". So there's no set date for it to release but they did give an update on what to expect including: 13 all-new levels, one new weapon, new inventory items, new enemy types and new types of ammo. Additionally there will be an "Arrange Mode, an amped-up remix of the entire original campaign with mirrored levels and modified enemy and item placement that introduce the enhanced loadout and enemy variety into the base game" along with new difficulty levels.</p>

      <title>Unity game engine team announce 3D platformer Gigaya, free for devs to tinker with</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unity Technologies have announced their next big example game for other developers to learn from. It's called Gigaya and it actually looks pretty great.</p>
<p>This will be a full example game free for Unity game engine developers, which will include the full assets and source code. Not only that, it's getting a Steam release when it's ready too.</p>
<p>The Unity team say they've been getting requests to make their own games, as a way of validating how the game engine is designed and how it all flows together. It makes sense, if you design a game engine but don't actually use it then there's going to be lots of areas that perhaps aren't quite right for a full development workflow. So now Unity are doing it with 15 people working on it across programmers, artists, designers, and producers. They will also see a mix of people working in their offices and remotely and they're hoping to pretty much emulate how indie and mid-sized studios work with it. All in the name of getting feedback to improve Unity, and provide a new example game.</p>

      <title>GNOME 42 released with the new global dark-style preference</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 42 has rolled out officially today with a bunch of new features, fixes and enhancements to make your Linux desktop experience even better.</p>
<p>One of the major new highlight features is the addition of a global dark UI style preference. You can use this to tell various applications to use a dark theme, if they support it. You can find it in the new Appearance panel in the Settings app.</p>
<p>There's also a renewed screenshot feature that allows both pictures and video recordings under the same roof. Many GNOME apps have also been upgraded to use GTK 4 and libadwaita, the next-generation tech bringing "better performance, a new modern UI style, and new user interface elements". The Settings app going through the biggest change here with a whole new look and feel. You will also find a new text editor, a new console app, RDP support and various performance improvements.</p>
<p>For gamers, they said that they've improved how "fullscreen apps are rendered will result in reduced energy consumption for video playback and increased frame rates for games".</p>

      <title>Lightweight Linux distro Lakka for retro gaming version 4.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://lakka.tv/" target="_blank">Lakka</a>, a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms various small computers into a full blown retrogaming console has a new release out now. With support for various models Raspberry Pi, Odroid, Anbernic, Allwinner and more — maybe that little device you've got laying around somewhere can be transformed with Lakka.</p>
<p>It's built on top of RetroArch, allowing you to get tons of emulation (and other things) working quite easily.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in Lakka 4.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build system based on LibreELEC 10.0.2</li>
<li>RetroArch updated to <a href="https://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-1-10-1-release/" target="_blank">1.10.1</a></li>
<li>Cores updated to their most recent versions
	<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">superbroswar</code>: added new libretro core</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">sameduck</code>: added new libretro core</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mesa updated to <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/22.0.0.html" target="_blank">22.0.0</a></li>
<li>Mainline kernel updated to 5.10.103 (PC, Amlogic, Allwinner, NXP)</li>
<li>Raspberry kernel updated to 5.10.95</li>
<li>Most arm devices switched to aarch64</li>
<li>Rockchip RK3288, RK3328 and RK3399 switched to mainline kernel 5.10.76</li>
<li>Added support for additional Allwinner and Amlogic devices (not tested on our side, as we do not own many of these devices)</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch: complete rewrite of the port with many fixes and enhancements</li>
<li>Tinkerboard and MiQi now use common system RK3288 (hence the change of the image names); you need to place empty file named <code class="inline-code">.nocompat</code> in the <code class="inline-code">/storage/.update</code> folder / <code class="inline-code">Update</code> Samba share</li>
<li>Dropped support for RPi4.arm</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wonderful life sim The Garden Path gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During The MIX 10th Anniversary Showcase, gorgeous gardening life sim The Garden Path got a new trailer.</p>
<p>"The Garden Path explores the quiet moments of a life well lived, where your garden will grow to reflect both the passing of time and your own design. Time here runs in concert with the real world, and the passing of seasons heralds new encounters and a new story to weave. Above all, The Garden Path is a life sim that celebrates the tranquil and the pensive, a tucked-away place to shape and grow as you like."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bAUYRq4iXPA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/81ea563e57cfbb78f3d92beae81268c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bAUYRq4iXPA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Garden Grown Your Way</strong> - Designed to be played as and when you wish, The Garden Path features a wealth of stories, activities and distractions to be experienced at your own pace. Don’t have time to watch your flowers grow? Come back tomorrow: time in the garden passes alongside the real world, and you’ll find plants you nurtured one day may bear fruit the next.</li>
<li><strong>A Family Affair</strong> - You won’t be alone in your new home. Charming inhabitants will come and go, from Bunk, the tea-brewing macaque to Larto, a Greenlandic Musk Ox with a penchant for song-fish. You may even find some visitors willing to make their home alongside your own!</li>
<li><strong>A Safe Space</strong> - The world of The Garden Path was designed with comfort in mind. Although a quiet and tranquil experience of flowing streams, gentle breezes and interesting characters, it is a safe space where reflection, and the potential melancholy that comes with it, are encouraged.</li>
<li><strong>A Feast for the Eyes</strong> - With a hand drawn aesthetic unlike any other, The Garden Path’s stunning visual design embraces you from the start, inviting you into its world of low-fi pleasures. Combined with a soothing original piano soundtrack, it won’t be long before you’re lost in the flow of a simple life.</li>

      <title>A quick look at 2022 7DRL Challenge games</title>
      <author>Dennis_Payne</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The 7 Day Roguelike Challenge was earlier this month with over 200 games submitted. I've spent the past week and half playing various games and I've also seen some streamed. That still means I've tried only a small number of games and Game Jams tend to lead to more <em>experimental</em> games.</p>
<p>Here is a selection of ten games I recommend from the game jam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://vwood.itch.io/savrogue-7drl" target="_blank">Svarogue</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1329833321648048045gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1329833321648048045gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Svarogue experimented with your weapon being separate from you. You can telekinetically move it around. Adding two characters to move can make the game hard to play but I think the developer did a good job with it here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://numeron.itch.io/mercury-salvage" target="_blank">Mercury Salvage</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15168707391648048070gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15168707391648048070gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The developer of Mercury Salvage has entered for the past 14 years. As such he starts with an engine he understands very well and he posted about his development in the game jam forums. I knew it looked amazing and the gameplay is equal to the artwork.</p>
<p>You play as an employee salvaging ships. You need to find pieces of scrap, survivors, the black box and kill any creatures on board. You have an air hose of limited length and a gun. You can detach from the air hose for a limited time. It is a great experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://maetl.itch.io/eyeful-7drl" target="_blank">Eyeful</a></p>
<p>This game looks more like a traditional roguelike. It is a beautiful game. The forest generation is amazing. You can only travel on the paths but can see between some of the tree so it doesn't feel like hard walls you find in most roguelikes. The path and trees are not one colour but different shades of brown and green.</p>
<p>You travel into a limestone chasm to try to find your father.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://nakade.itch.io/saturday-night-one-shot" target="_blank">Saturday Night One Shot</a></p>
<p>This game also has awesome art direction. You show up for your weekly game but this week the game master is running a one shot. You see the complete dungeon but not the content of the rooms. The style is designed to look like a map from a game master might make. The adventure log has the game master tells you if the monster hits and how much damage you take.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://orion-black.itch.io/puzzle-crawl" target="_blank">Puzzle Crawl</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18350623331648048112gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18350623331648048112gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>There are games that combine genres in the contest. Puzzle Crawl is not a match 3 game. You can match blocks less than three to my initial surprise. There are a variety of monsters on the board you can defeat. The blocks you activate before getting to the monster alter your stats temporarily or grant experience points. As you level up you can skills and you can find items in treasure chests. The game was made for the Pico-8 virtual console.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://veralos.itch.io/the-omega-rod" target="_blank">The Omega Rod</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5752494471648048137gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5752494471648048137gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The Omega Rod drops turn based play for real time. It feels similar to Enter The Gungeon. Instead of a gun, you are a wizards with a single rod to start with. You gain more rods as you defeat monsters. You also gain abilities. Some abilities always affect you. Some abilities only work with rods in certain subgroups like wands.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://mcneja.itch.io/amulet-raider" target="_blank">Amulet Raider</a></p>
<p>Amulet Raider is another real time game. It combines Rogue with the gameplay of XQuest (Crystal Quest). I haven't played XQuest to my knowledge. The character gets momentum from the movement of the mouse. You do not stop automatically. You can fire in the direction you are travelling. There are potions which can grant invulnerability. You can look at a large map but the game does not pause.</p>

<p>The developer lists this as an incomplete roguelike with a team of characters. This is not the only squad based entry in the game jam I played but despite being unfinished I liked this one the best. The other characters will automatically attack if not being controlled. They can't be told to follow which is my biggest complaint. The graphical version has nice artwork. The developer includes the source code but no license which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Don't feel like crawling around a dungeon. You can always go fishing. Your goal is to catch the jaguar shark but you need to advance in level before you can do that. It is a well polished game.</p>

<p>Some entries stretch the roguelike or roguelite genre more than others. This one is a real-time shoot em up written for the PICO-8. The graphics are well done. You can choose your ship and you get upgrades during your play-through.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets an official Steam Deck setting but seems broken</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED recently released another major patch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Curiously, they added a dedicated Steam Deck preset in the graphics options.</p>
<p>Nice to see they're paying attention and tweaking things like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/cd-projekt-red-working-closely-with-valve-as-the-witcher-3-is-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">they said</a> they would be. However, I'm not sure what they're trying to achieve with this new option. Checking between the various presets available, the new Steam Deck option is exactly the same as the Ultra setting. It seems broken and doesn't do anything, or it wasn't supposed to be live right now but no matter the case, it's really not right. Doing a benchmark on the Steam Deck with the setting gives an overall sub-30FPS. If you reload the game with Steam Deck set in the settings, it just goes back to Ultra as the preset too.</p>
<p>To show it clearly here's the Steam Deck setting, followed by Medium and the difference is striking:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pre_ZM54FK4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/453e87844706563a97a559143c64af15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pre_ZM54FK4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Of course this was tested and verified across multiple runs, quitting the game between preset changes and such to ensure it was actually fully set. It's just broken, perhaps a copy and paste error.</p>
<p>Hopefully CDPR will take another look and actually set it correctly, as there's simply no way this is what it's supposed to be. For now, it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>New Update</strong>: After some more fun investigating, the Steam Deck preset definitely doesn't work right. By itself, it sets High+Ultra but it's more than that.</p>
<p>Going from Medium to Steam Deck and running the benchmark, it gave a higher performance than my video.</p>
<p>Reloading the game, it then says it's preset to Ultra. So I set it to Steam Deck again and run benchmark to see really low performance. Then I set it to Low, go back to the menu, then back in and set again to Steam Deck and run then benchmark again, and it's the best performance I've seen yet.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk seems to grab onto what preset you had <em>last</em> for Steam Deck, and any restart when you've set to Steam Deck seems to jack it back up to Ultra. So, the Steam Deck preset is definitely broken which is why other videos may show a different performance or visuals.</p>
<p>Low: 46.31 average FPS<br/>
Swapping Low to Steam Deck: 46.26 average FPS</p>
<p>Medium: 36.72 average FPS<br/>
Swapping Medium to Steam Deck: 36.30 average FPS</p>
<p>High: 28.39 average FPS<br/>
Swapping High to Steam Deck: 28.11 average FPS</p>
<p>Go back to even just the menu after going through the presets and setting Steam Deck, then back into the benchmark: 22.07 average FPS as it seems to default Steam Deck preset to High+Ultra. Saw the same behaviour on desktop too.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 510.60.02 driver rolls out for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released the latest update to their Linux driver with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/187162/en-uk" target="_blank">version 510.60.02</a> available now with new GPU support and also some bug fixes. Not as big as previous driver releases but still some essential fixes included.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the following GPUs:
	<ul>
<li>NVIDIA RTX A4000H<br/>
		NVIDIA RTX A5500</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause displays with HDMI or DisplayPort audio to be deselected as the default audio output device after resuming from suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL applications to hang or render incorrectly after suspend/resume cycles or VT-switches</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, introduced in 495.29.05, that caused GPU "Model:" in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/<bus:device.function>/information to be "Unknown" for some GPUs.</bus:device.function></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to print spurious error messages</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent nvidia-installer from detecting the scripts/sign-file kernel module signing tool when using separate kernel source and output directories.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented kernel modules linked from precompiled kernel interface object files from being loaded on recent Linux kernels. This affected custom packages which were prepared with nvidia-installer's --add-this-kernel option, for example.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>How to upgrade? That all depends on what Linux distribution you're on, as they all have their own way of doing it. </p>

      <title>Google announce &#39;alpha-quality&#39; Steam on Chrome OS is now actually here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam for Chrome OS is here. For real this time, they've <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/156452389/early-support-for-steam-coming-to-dev-channel" target="_blank">actually released</a> it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announces-steam-for-chromeos-chromebooks-in-alpha/" target="_blank">unlike when they claimed</a> it was released during their recent developer event. Now though it's here at an "alpha-quality" level, meaning prepare for bugs and other weirdness.</p>
<p>Not only will this help those using Chromebooks do some gaming but Linux gaming as a whole too. Chrome OS is powered by Linux, and the Steam client on Chrome OS is the Linux version inside their special container — it works for both native Linux games and Windows games run with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Although, you do need to enable Steam Play manually (same as on a normal Linux desktop).</p>
<p>Starting with Chrome OS version 14583.0.0 which is in the "Dev" channel, here's what Chromebooks are currently supported for it (as long as they don't have an i3 CPU or less than 8GB RAM):</p>
<ul>
<li>Acer Chromebook 514 (CB514-1W)</li>
<li>Acer Chromebook 515 (CB515-1W)</li>
<li>Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (CP713-3W)</li>
<li>ASUS Chromebook Flip CX5 (CX5500)</li>
<li>ASUS Chromebook CX9 (CX9400)</li>
<li>HP Pro c640 G2 Chromebook</li>
<li>Lenovo 5i-14 Chromebook</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a number of issues to begin with like anti-cheat not working with Proton games (even those with it turned on for Linux), Windows games using DirectX 12 don't start and more. You can see the list of issues, some tested games and instructions on their <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/" target="_blank">"Steam on Chrome OS Alpha</a>" website.</p>

      <title>Discover Overlay is a Discord chat UI that now works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to see who is chatting in Discord on a Steam Deck or Linux desktop, while you're gaming or doing other things? Let me introduce you to the <a href="https://trigg.github.io/Discover/" target="_blank">Discover Overlay</a>.</p>
<p>Giving you quite a few options to tweak the style to your liking, you can display the avatar of people in your currently connected voice-chat, and text channels as well. It's really useful and makes it all incredibly easy to do. To give it a test and a brief guide because it really is simple to get going, check out this video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9-Eu4o3AzMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c84721ff5f99e5725faff7f56475518d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9-Eu4o3AzMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full Steam Deck instructions on the <a href="https://trigg.github.io/Discover/deckaddnonsteamgame" target="_blank">official site</a>. <u>Note</u>: it does <em>not</em> work together with the performance overlay.</p>
<p>There's fun little story behind some of the work involved here though, as it turns out one of the developers of the Discover Overlay is partly responsible for having the performance overlay on Steam Deck being a thing. I asked them about it, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for our work targeting the Steam Deck... We realised pretty early after it was announced that we would 100% like to target it, it was just a question of how. After it became apparent that the deck would use Gamescope as it's compositor, trigg started looking into the feasibility of overlays with gamescope. In October he submitted a PR which laid the groundwork for getting external overlays running on the deck. This was later used as the foundation to get MangoApp running on the Deck - <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/363" target="_blank">https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/363</a></p>
<p>We were pretty hyped about getting code into gamescope! After the official launch of the Deck we realised that we didn't actually have any way of testing whether our overlay actually runs on the Steam Deck or not. Thankfully we managed to get hold of one just over a week ago and work has been non-stop since then to get the overlay running perfectly, get the app in the Discover store &amp; get a landing page setup for users to easily install the project!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can download it easily for Linux / Steam Deck from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.trigg.discover_overlay" target="_blank">Flathub</a> or see the source and find other instructions on their <a href="https://github.com/trigg/Discover" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Alice: Madness Returns appears on Steam again, works well on Steam Deck with 60FPS fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/19680/Alice_Madness_Returns/" target="_blank">Alice: Madness Returns</a> is an absolute classic from Spicy Horse Games and EA. It vanished from Steam for years and it recently arrived back. With Proton on Linux and Steam Deck, it does work quite well too!</p>
<p>The Windows version is locked to 30FPS, although there is an easy fix to put it into 60FPS. Simply go into the right click -&gt; Properties menu, local files -&gt; browse. From there go into AliceGame -&gt; Config -&gt; open up DefaultEngine.ini and look for the first place it says "MaxSmoothedFrameRate" and change that to 60. That's it and you're good to go. One thing to mention is that, at least on Steam Deck, there are some lighting glitches present. It's not overly distracting but a few of the flashes may cause issues for some people.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sdjP3-mzCOc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6726a6164a2163eb5aa1d884f560f48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sdjP3-mzCOc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Great news, as I know a fair few people who loved Alice: Madness Returns and now it's free of Origin once again. Installation and setup for Steam Deck / Linux is a simple click and no funny business.</p>
<p>A third game "Alice: Asylum" is still a possibility, which American McGee released a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/alice-asylum-v1-55122604" target="_blank">potential script</a> for back in 2021.</p>
<p><em>Alice: Madness Returns is 60% off on Steam until March 28.</em></p>

      <title>OBS Studio arrives on Steam but no Linux build for now so stick to Flatpak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the very popular and fantastic open source video capture software OBS Studio have done a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905180/OBS_Studio/" target="_blank">Steam</a> release. For Linux users though, you should just stick to Flatpak from Flathub.</p>
<p>With the Steam release it's only supported for Windows and macOS, and their official <a href="https://obsproject.com/kb/steam-faq" target="_blank">Steam FAQ post</a> mentions they have "no concrete plans for providing a Linux build on Steam". Why though? They said they can just re-use existing builds for other platforms but for Linux it would need another <em>additional</em> build done. However, they also said they will "look into the feasibility of providing such a version" but they're quite busy.</p>
<p>A shame perhaps but the good news is that the version available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.obsproject.Studio" target="_blank">Flathub</a> is officially supported by the OBS team and works across pretty much any Linux distribution. In fact, it's the exact package I use for all video recording and livestreams so I can definitely recommend it anyway.</p>

      <title>FreeRCT sees a first release trying to capture the feel of RollerCoaster Tycoon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there is the popular <a href="https://openrct2.org/" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> for an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, it does rely on the original data files, and so the <a href="https://freerct.net/" target="_blank">FreeRCT</a> project aims to be a completely free and open source inspired game.</p>
<p>Very early days for the project yet but it has to start somewhere, and the idea is a promising one. It's not just a basic clone or a game engine reimplmentation of the classics, instead it's inspired by it to capture the feel. Perhaps with enough time, and enough people to help out, it might reach the heights of <a href="https://www.openttd.org/" target="_blank">OpenTTD</a> which is based upon Transport Tycoon Deluxe but doesn't require the original data files.</p>

      <title>60 Parsecs! gets a small update to improve Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space adventure game 60 Parsecs! from Robot Gentleman has just recently had a small update and it should improve the experience on a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Currently, Valve gave it a "Playable" rating through Deck Verified noting it has some minor display issues. Seems that could be solved now, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646270/view/3140704028437753142" target="_blank">patch notes</a> mention "UX improvements on Steam Deck" along with other improvements.</p>
<p>More about it: "Atomic Space Age was a blast! Until it became the Post-Apocalyptic Space Age. Your space station is about to explode and you only have 60 seconds before things get messy. What (or who) will you grab before you make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle and begin your journey into THE GREAT UNKNOWN?</p>
<p>This is 60 Parsecs!, a dark comedy sci-fi adventure set in the Atomic Space Age - complete with all the Cold War paranoia, chrome-plated wall accents and cockroaches with space helmets."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OdRBWBAiO_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70e454f568d9f8d84f79fb98b7b3d159.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OdRBWBAiO_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCAVENGE &amp; EVACUATE - With only 60 seconds before nukes reduce the space station to floating particles in the vacuum of space, frantically grab whatever supplies and crew you can before getting out of there. You never know when that sock puppet will come in handy.</li>
<li>SURVIVE &amp; DECIDE - Space funerals are inconvenient, so try to avoid dying where possible. Use your limited supplies and (hopefully not limited) wits to make difficult choices and ensure your survival, even though the odds are definitely stacked against you.</li>
<li>EXPLORE &amp; CRAFT - Duct tape fixes all problems, but how do you fix (or at least craft) duct tape? Chart expeditions to find resources, craft survival essentials and explore strange new worlds in a procedural, very-much-permadeath adventure.</li>
<li>LEAD &amp; PROTECT - As captain, it's your duty to keep the crew happy - they're less likely to kill you that way. Manage relationships as you watch them grow closer and hopefully not throw each other out the airlock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/60-parsecs?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646270/60_Parsecs/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Now you too can underpay everyone in Office Management 101</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Like the tycoon and management sims of old, Office Management 101 has entered Early Access and so far it's looking like players are enjoying it.</p>

While it's business focused it's full of "quirky characters, slapstick humor, and unexpected events in a cheerful and detailed capitalist dystopia". You assume  the role of CEO of a fresh electronics company tasked with hiring employees, designing your office and turning it all into a "ruthless money-making machine".</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recruit, underpay and overwork your workforce!</li>
<li>Master the art of Office Architecture and Decoration!</li>
<li>Devise high-priced products for gullible consumers!</li>
<li>Achieve a set of goals in <strong>Scenario Mode</strong>!</li>
<li>Follow your own path to glory in <strong>Sandbox</strong> Mode!</li>
<li>Expanded gameplay with Steam Workshop mod support!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine and Proton have a &#39;Curious Case of Phasmophobia&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank">Phasmophobia</a> on a Linux desktop or Steam Deck? Well, it still doesn't yet work fully as the voice recognition isn't there but support for it is coming thanks to the Wine team.</p>
<p>On Steam you would use Proton (which is built from Wine) since it's a Windows game, but the problem is that Phasmophobia uses Windows-specific voice recognition which you can't replicate right now. Recently though, Wine development version 7.4 was released and the changelog noted some additions for speech recognition.</p>
<p>To give more info, World Wine News issue 414 went up titled "<a href="https://www.winehq.org/wwn/414" target="_blank">The Curious Case of Phasmophobia</a>" and as it turns out, the work involved is to directly help this game (and as a bonus of course bring speech recognition to Wine / Proton) as it's a good popular game to test with.</p>
<p>With the work spearheaded by developer Bernhard Kölbl (with help from others), they've created the start of an implementation of the windows.media.speech libraries. To even get there though, many other parts of Wine needed improving or some things missing entirely like adding in new "boilerplate code" for the likes of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Windows Runtime (WinRT). After that, they needed some speech recognition software, as it would be crazy to write their own, so they ended up with <a href="https://alphacephei.com/vosk/" target="_blank">Vosk</a> and got it working with Wine.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning they say so more patches and work is yet to come. Still, it might not be too long before the ghosts will hear your screams.</p>

      <title>Sandbox life sim RPG &#39;Kynseed&#39; gets a Beta for improved Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh good, another fantastic looking pixel-art life sim to suck away my time. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/758870/Kynseed/" target="_blank">Kynseed</a> from PixelCount Studios has a Beta available on Steam for better Steam Deck support. It's been in Early Access since November 2018, with the Steam Deck announcement in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/758870/view/3137326328688118550" target="_blank">patch notes</a> from Friday, March 18.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2oCSoV072SQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9873d56b307e10e726d2f32667238540.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2oCSoV072SQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to try the Beta? Simply go into the game's properties, head the Beta tab and select the Steam Deck Beta from the list.</p>
<p>Currently, Valve has given it an "Unsupported" rating with Deck Verified. Curious about improvements, I decided to give this one a direct test and it does work great. One issue remains though, with text input still needing you to manually bring up the Steam Deck keyboard.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em><u><strong>Run a business</strong></u></em> such as a blacksmith, tavern, apothecary, or goods store.</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Go adventuring</strong></u></em> in dangerous regions and battle dark faery tale creatures.</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Farm your land</strong></u></em> to create various ingredients that you'll come to rely on.</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Develop relationships</strong></u></em> with NPC’s who have their own lives and who will remember your deeds, actions, and pranks!</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Find proverbs</strong></u></em> to unlock the secrets of this mysterious dark faery tale world.</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Gather materials</strong></u></em> to create items, craft beers, or mix cures for a range of bizarre maladies.</li>
<li><em><u><strong>Buy strange artifacts</strong></u></em> from the mysterious Mr Fairweather - items which can aid your chores, help you in combat, or just let you mess with the world. But be warned of his life tax, for each item must be paid with years from your life!</li>
<li><em><u><strong>A world and story</strong></u></em> which aren't always sunshine and roses (just like real life!).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Please Fix The Road is a gorgeous upcoming puzzle game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Ariel Jurkowski emailed in about their upcoming game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1383250/Please_Fix_The_Road/" target="_blank">Please Fix The Road</a>, a puzzle game all about fixing up the roads and it really does look quite wonderful. The developer also confirmed full Linux support at release.</p>
<p>"Please Fix The Road is a colorful, minimalistic, laid-back and casual puzzle game in which it's probably not hard to guess... you're fixing roads! In each level you have a specific limited set of tools that will help you get all the cars, boats, trains or animals from their point A to point B. The mentioned animals include, of course, kittens, dogs and... pink llamas! You are able to manipulate multiple tiles at the same time. You can insert, destroy, rotate, copy, swap, raise, lower, push or move different segments of roads, rivers, paths or railroad tracks. The game combines elements of many other logic games into a nice minimalistic experience."</p>

<p>Going to have to keep an eye on this as it looks great.</p>
<p>It's planned to release sometime this year on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1383250/Please_Fix_The_Road/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. You can also see plenty of nice GIFs on their <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielJurkowski" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <title>A Musical Story is a very unique rhythm game with plenty of soul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I've gone through plenty of games that have a musical theme to them and a fair few finger-bashing rhythm games but none of them are quite like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546100/A_Musical_Story/" target="_blank">A Musical Story</a>. Developed by the French indie team at Glee-Cheese Studio, this is not a game about hitting a high-score instead it tells a story through the music and some wonderful animated clips.</p>
<p><em>Digerati sent over a key and I fell in love with this almost instantly.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J9WSIlZ0iJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5346a4c15055cff0842f94bdaea5201c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J9WSIlZ0iJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Like traditional rhythm games you might know, it does require you to hit the right keys for the right notes as they're played. However, it's massively more relaxed than others and gives you a little time to hit them, and then repeats until you get it right. The music is absolutely wonderful too, quite mellow even and with headphones on it's a huge delight to get completely sucked into it. I closed my eyes a few times to do it and gosh — what an experience.</p>
<p>In addition to being part of The Day of the Devs Official Selection, A Musical Story has won 'Best Art Direction' at the Indie X Awards, 'Best Audio' at the Taipei Game Show, and received two Honorable Mentions at this year's Independent Games Festival Awards for 'Excellence in Audio' and 'Excellence in Visual Art'.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rekindle Gabriel's memories with rhythmic button presses in time with the music</li>
<li>Storytelling without words – discover Gabriel’s journey through music and visuals alone</li>
<li>Gabriel's story comes to life through a beautifully crafted art style</li>
<li>A unique original soundtrack featuring 26 songs</li>
<li>Play every song perfectly to unlock a hidden chapter</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux Mint Debian Edition 5 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint Debian Edition 5 has been <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4287" target="_blank">released</a>, giving you a stable Debian base with all the niceties that comes from the Mint team. The point of this distribution for the Mint team, is to provide a sort-of safety net if Ubuntu was to vanish on them, since the main Linux Mint distribution is based upon Ubuntu, which itself is based on Debian directly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6894712631647856508gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6894712631647856508gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - LMDE 5, Cinnamon desktop</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://linuxmint.com/rel_elsie.php" target="_blank">release notes</a> aren't particularly long or interesting, and don't actually go over any fun new features, it's mainly just a list of issues you might encounter. It does jump from using Debian Buster (version 10) to Debian Bullseye (version 11) though, so you get a ton of overall package updates.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds has announced the release of the Linux Kernel version 5.17, with one of the most prominent features being the new AMD P-State driver for modern CPUs.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/3/20/213" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "So we had an extra week of at the end of this release cycle, and I'm happy to report that it was very calm indeed.  We could probably have skipped it with not a lot of downside, but we did get a few last-minute reverts and fixes in and avoid some brown-paper bugs that would otherwise have been stable fodder, so it's all good."</p>
<p>You can view a human-readable changelog thanks to the folks at <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.17" target="_blank">Kernel Newbies</a> but here's some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD P-State driver - a performance scaling driver that introduces a new CPU frequency control mechanism on AMD Zen based CPU series in Linux kernel. Designed to give better power efficiency and can help the likes of the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Updates for next-generation AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>More improvements to bring up support for Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Initial support for Intel Raptor Lake S graphics.</li>
<li>Support for custom fan curves found on some ASUS ROG laptops.</li>
<li>New driver for x86 Android tablets.</li>
<li>Security: straight-line-speculation mitigations.</li>
<li>An addition for System76 EC specific functionality.</li>
<li>New driver for Lenovo Yoga Book.</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more, that's just me cherry-picking a few bits that stood out.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 1,500 titles either Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The list of titles going through Steam Deck Verified continues to grow, with the total now over 1,500! A pretty great number but as always, it's just a number. What we want to see is quality, and to have Deck Verified be accurate on the ratings.</p>
<p>Totals currently (1,524):</p>
<ul>
<li>819 Verified</li>
<li>705 Playable</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remember though: not being Verified or Playable doesn't mean it won't work, it just means it hasn't been through Valve's formal certification yet.</em></p>
<p>So what can you look forward to that has been through certification recently or has improved? Here's a few since we last covered it (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=DeckCompatDate_DESC&amp;category1=998%2C994%2C21&amp;deck_compatibility=3%2C2&amp;os=win%2Clinux" target="_blank">full list</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator - Verified</li>
<li>Bloodwash - Verified</li>
<li>DYSMANTLE - Verified</li>
<li>Dota Underlords - Verified</li>
<li>eFootball PES 2020 - Verified</li>
<li>Haven - Verified</li>
<li>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 - Playable</li>
<li>NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 2 - Verified</li>
<li>Neon Abyss - Verified</li>
<li>Outlast 2 - Playable</li>
<li>POSTAL 4: No Regerts - Playable</li>
<li>Shadow Warrior 3 - Playable</li>
<li>shapez.io - Playable</li>
<li>Superliminal - Unsupported to Playable</li>
<li>TUNIC - Verified</li>
<li>WRATH: Aeon of Ruin - Playable</li>
</ul>
<p>For games to be fully Verified they need to hit these marks:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Input - The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.</li>
<li>Display - The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.</li>
<li>Seamlessness - The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.</li>
<li>System Support - If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Microsoft announce Xbox Cloud Gaming for Steam Deck with Edge (Beta)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and Microsoft teamed up to better support the Steam Deck, with Xbox Cloud Gaming now supported through the Edge browser.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>"We’re particularly excited about this ourselves as we feel it can open new opportunities in the Linux gaming community." — Missy Quarry, Community Manage for Microsoft Edge</em></p>
<p>It must be a particularly cold day in hell for Microsoft to move closer to supporting a Linux system, although it already worked on Linux through Chromium-based browsers so they haven't exactly pushed the boat out. Still, it's a pretty big shift from the old Microsoft wouldn't you say?</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/th77w9/microsoft_edge_beta_the_browser_for_xbox_cloud/" target="_blank">Reddit Post</a> (with custom artwork you can use) and a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/xbox-cloud-gaming-in-microsoft-edge-with-steam-deck-43dd011b-0ce8-4810-8302-965be6d53296" target="_blank">Support Article</a> that goes over the steps needed. It's not quick and easy but it's not overly complicated either. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load Discover Software Centre from Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Install Microsoft Edge (the icon will say "Beta").</li>
<li>Find Edge in the Application Launcher (bottom left icon), right click it and hit Add to Steam.</li>
<li>When the Steam list comes up, find Edge and add it.</li>
<li>Now you'll need to set an override for the Flatpak package of Edge that's installed. You can either do it using <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal" target="_blank">Flatseal</a> or this terminal command in the Konsole app: <code class="inline-code">flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.microsoft.Edge</code>.</li>
<li>Now you'll need to edit the shortcut in Steam. Locate Edge in your Steam Library, right click -&gt; Properties.</li>
<li>Where it says "Launch Options" at the bottom, enter this in <strong>after</strong> what's already there: <code class="inline-code">--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://www.xbox.com/play"</code></li>
<li>Optional: change the shortcut name to "Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta)".</li>
<li>You will also need to change Steam Input to "Gamepad with touchpad as Mouse".</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, this process will get <em>much</em> easier, as Microsoft's Ben Mathwig <a href="https://twitter.com/bjmathwig/status/1504900067123089408" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on Twitter they are actively working on it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#cloud" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16716569611647630082gol1.jpg"/><em>Here's a list of games</em></a><em> Xbox Cloud supports.</em></p>
<p>So far, it seems a little finicky though. Sometimes the game/store pages won't load, it gives a little <em>ping</em> noise and nothing really happens. Same for loading some games, it makes the <em>ping</em> sound and then…nothing. Not entirely sure what the issue is here, and it could be specific to my Deck somewhere but it's certainly not working as expected right now for me overall apart from the first game I tried. It seems entirely random on what game pages load and what games actually work. <strong>Update</strong>: if you also face the same problem, clear the Edge browser Cache in desktop mode. Fixes it every time for me. I've been chatting to Microsoft about it, and have given them info on it. <strong>Update 2</strong>: after my feedback, Microsoft have tracked it down and are working on a fix. <strong>Update 3</strong> <strong>- 23/03/22</strong>: I continued testing for MSFT and they fixed the issue, games all load properly now as the modal to tell you about controls, network and such appears correctly now.</p>
<p>Quick video demonstration:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="slsqf3PyzcY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/603d2f26906e6bb4e49db91d68b95f31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/slsqf3PyzcY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Why is it all needed? Well, Chrome doesn't <em>yet</em> support the Deck controls, which I noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">in my original review</a>. So Microsoft have come along to present Edge as your cloud gaming Steam Deck saviour here.</p>
<p>Guess what? It <a href="https://youtu.be/pRGP_MXy2Wc" target="_blank">works for Stadia too</a>. I tested it working just fine, you can just change the launch options URL to go to Stadia instead if you wish. Meanwhile, GeForce NOW just complains about an unsupported browser.</p>

      <title>Home Wind is a free minimalist, relaxing and cozy city builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Home Wind released into Early Access recently as a free city-builder, although not really like many others as it takes a much more relaxed approach. Tested on Linux with Proton 7, it works perfectly.</p>
<p>It actually reminds me of ISLANDERS, in fact the basic mechanics are very close, with you placing down buildings trying to build up a score by what they're near. Not particularly challenging but that's the point. Home Wind wants you to slow down, make a cuppa and build up some points as you stare at its lovely hand-painted styled artwork and I'm all for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CLf5U0pf-9g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e892350e76492722822d58180b3ac14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CLf5U0pf-9g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not even remotely deep either, you just keep on building up and getting more points as it gradually gives you more different structures to place down. There's not a lot that you would expect from a city-builder but that's also what helps to set it apart.</p>
<p>As you place down more structures, your points build up and gradually you level up. Levelling up gives you access to more types of levels and really that's mostly it. Thoroughly charming and with plenty of room to grow, with the developer planning to add in new game modes, more content, building interactions and so on. For now, just a nice free way to chill out that might eventually have a cost attached as it grows.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1572080/Home_Wind/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Boatswain is a new Stream Deck compatible app for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Elgato continue to ignore the Linux market, developers from around the community end up creating applications to fill the gap. Now there's <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/feaneron/boatswain/" target="_blank">Boatswain</a>, which allows Linux users to control Elgato Stream Deck devices.</p>
<p>It's not the first of its kind, with streamdeck_ui also being an option (I covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/10/using-the-elgato-stream-deck-on-linux-just-got-a-whole-lot-easier-with-streamdeck-ui/" target="_blank">back in 2019</a>) that is still being updated. More options are good though! Why make a new one anyway? In a <a href="https://feaneron.com/2022/03/17/boatswain-your-stream-deck-app-for-linux/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the developer mentioned they "did not find these apps adequate to my usage".</p>
<p>Some of what they're focusing on for the first release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Backend code to detect Stream Deck devices, open them, upload images to buttons, and change the brightness of the device</li>
<li>Folders, profiles, and multiactions</li>
<li>OBS Studio integration: start &amp; stop streaming, start &amp; stop recording, switch to a scene</li>
<li>Sound player, initially focusing on playing sound effects</li>
<li>App launching</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They will also be considering these too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chat integration with various streaming services (Twitch, YouTube, etc)</li>
<li>Window management actions through a custom GNOME Shell extension</li>
<li>More features to OBS Studio integration, such as showing &amp; hiding sources, recording to the replay buffer, etc</li>
<li>Enhanced sound player with different playlists and MPRIS integration</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ultra-fast FPS &#39;REAVER&#39; has a new Playtest Demo up on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More FPS goodness available to check out now, with a public <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890950/REAVER/" target="_blank">Playtest Demo of REAVER</a> up on Steam and it's looking really quite promising but it's very fast-paced. A little bit too fast for me personally but it's got plenty of style you might enjoy.</p>
<p>The developer just recently adjusted it for the Linux version, which initially wasn't running due to some problems with Steam but now it seems to run quite nicely but they would still appreciate feedback from the Playtest. Check out their brand new trailer below too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PozjcN21nBE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7e6e7cf5e989ff73d7f781ccc2d4b67a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PozjcN21nBE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>REAVER is STYLISH - Revolver Ultimate Ability: HEADSHOT CHAIN. Some weapons have abilities and ultimates that cost mana. Kill to gain mana.

      <title>The great space RPG &#39;Star Traders: Frontiers&#39; gets some Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Traders: Frontiers is a popular space adventure RPG from Trese Brothers and a new update is out, with some improvements ready for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Announced on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/335620/announcements/detail/3140703398397842310" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developer mentioned a previous update that added tweaks for the Steam Deck screen, which they have now adjusted due to some unforeseen issue for regular players. Now instead there's a dedicated "small screen display" option you can turn on, which will adjust the whole UI to give a better fit and clarity. Might even help those with old eyes even on bigger screens too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cY7vqWko1uI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d513831b8f4d38aa91ebb5c45311e07e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cY7vqWko1uI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It really is nice to see so many developers add options for adjusting their interface. It's been a long time coming, with some games even on a big screen just being too small. I hope this continues for a long time.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a rich, open universe: Discover endless procedurally-generated galactic maps, meet unique characters, and take on enemies to conquer the galaxy!</li>
<li>Become an intergalactic captain: Take on the role of a spy, smuggler, explorer, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, and more (33 jobs total)!</li>
<li>Customize your own spaceship: Choose from more than 350 upgrades and 45 ship hulls to build your very own vessel to venture across the vast reaches of space.</li>
<li>Assemble your wing fleet: Outfit your capital ship as a carrier and launch interdictors, bombers and shuttles into space combat against your enemy</li>
<li>Assemble and tailor a loyal crew: Assign talents and equip specialized gear for every spaceship crew member.</li>
<li>Experience an ever-changing narrative: Decide to make friends or foes with other factions and influence political, economic, and personal vendettas.</li>
<li>Varied Difficulty Options! play with save slots to try out different builds or storylines or turn on character permadeath and enjoy classic roguelike experience</li>
<li>Achievement Unlocks: accomplish story and challenge goals to unlock additional optional (but not better) content like new starting ships and new starting contacts. Or simply load the moddable version of the game to skip this entirely!</li>
<li>Mold the crew by your choices: As you make decisions and set the tone for your ship, your crew will grow and change to match. Destroy enemy ships with all hands on deck and your crew will become more bloodthirsty and savage. Explore distant worlds and loot dangerous wastelands and your crew will become intrepid and clever ... or scarred and half-mad.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GOG update their stance on DRM-free, Galaxy as &#39;optional&#39; for single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> team have <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/bgog_2022_update_2b_our_commitment_to_drmfree_gaming" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a new update on their plans for the store, and it seems they will continue to note that their Galaxy client is optional.</p>
<p>It comes at an interesting time, since there was a bit of an issue with the HITMAN release that ended up being pulled down since it required online to do a lot and unlock a lot of things. GOG is well-known as the DRM-free store, and this isn't exactly changing but they're tweaking what they mean by it.</p>
<p>They talk a little about how things have changed, and that some "of the most infamous DRMs of the past are thankfully long gone, it doesn’t mean the constraints are fully gone". It is a complex thing, as they say, as so many games now offer online features even for single-player titles, so GOG has more of a plan to handle them now.</p>
<p>Here's the three main points they will stick to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The single-player mode has to be accessible offline.<br/>
2. Games you bought and downloaded can never be taken from you or altered against your will.<br/>
3. The GOG GALAXY client is and will remain optional for accessing single-player offline mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Point number 3 is an interesting one, as it's only optional for single-player. There are already a few games that use the Galaxy API for multiplayer instead of a standalone solution.</p>
<p>They also said they will continue to "make games compatible with future OSs and available for you for years to come".</p>
<p>When it comes to multiplayer "games with those features belong on GOG", although they will be updating the GOG store to let you more easily discover them and add more info to store pages to help better inform potential buyers.</p>

      <title>Halftime Heroes is basically a 3D Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no, not again, not another game to hook me in and steal away my free time. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1907900/Halftime_Heroes/" target="_blank">Halftime Heroes</a> is out in Early Access. <u>Note</u>: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about it, Halftime Heroes is clearly a shameless attempt to jump on the hype-train created by the very popular <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a>. However, Vampire Survivors was not the first wave-based survival game and certainly won't be the last but it has helped to push their popularity up with a very clear design — and that is exactly what Halftime Heroes has copied and put into 3D.</p>
<p>I won't fault them though, not completely. This kind of thing happens everywhere across every industry, it's how Battle Royale got popular, auto-battlers too, various FPS games and so on — they all copy each other. With Halftime Heroes, they have a native Linux version right out of the gate too. Here's some footage from my Steam Deck (it works just fine on desktop too):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IMBTVDgsTJY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5020741b4c002ce2eb0b664deba0658.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IMBTVDgsTJY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After playing it a little, I do have some immediate issues with their take on it. The first is that the 3D perspective they chose makes it sometimes hard to tell exactly how much space there is between you and enemies, leading to you getting hit when you think you can wiggle through. Another is the music, it's terrible and doesn't fit at all. Optimization is an issue here too, with even my powerful main PC dropping down to 30FPS when in later waves with lots of abilities firing everywhere.</p>
<p><em>For now, as a game that's unfinished and in Early Access, it's promising enough.</em></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6 different classes with different strengths</li>
<li>4 Different modes instantly unlocked for different playthroughs</li>
<li>Fight against hordes of monsters</li>
<li>5 different bosses waiting with awesome loot</li>
<li>Roll for luck, throw the dices and improve the treasure you find!</li>
<li>Experiment through different combinations of stats and spells</li>
<li>Upgrade your skills and improve your chances each time you lose</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really, I don't think it will hit the popularity level of Vampire Survivors but I certainly won't count it out either. If there's one thing I've learned over the last few years: expect the unexpected to become popular, especially when AAA games continue to cost a fair amount of money and Halftime Heroes is only about £2.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Overlord expansion announced enabling you to expand your power</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh goodie, more ways to completely mess with the whole galaxy. Stellaris: Overlord has been announced as the next full proper expansion for the popular grand-strategy game from Paradox.</p>
<p>Overlord will grant you access to new features centred around more intricate management of intergalactic empires, from specialized vassals to powerful new megastructures. Sounds like it gives you more tools to become some sort of evil empire, although not just that as you will be able to help out other systems you control too. With their changes it also means if you become a vassal it's not a delayed game over, with new options to play through.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The stories our players have told through the last six years of Stellaris never fail to amaze us,” said Stephen Muray, Game Director of Stellaris at Paradox Development Studio. “We’ve seen empires rise and fall, unite and destroy, and clash overtly or covertly with their galactic neighbors. With Overlord, we want to give players more options and opportunities to realize their own ‘space operas,’ build a universe full of grand houses or squabbling vassals, and see how long they can hold power over what they’ve created. Look for more details on what it means to be a galactic Overlord very soon!”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KC6GMyrEEXY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/147c08748bf936cb60a654295138022b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KC6GMyrEEXY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No date is being given yet other than "soon" and it will bring a big free 3.4 "Cepheus" update to Stellaris with new content and adjustments for all. More info in their new <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-246-announcing-overlord.1515008/" target="_blank">developer diary</a>.</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited by the sound of this one.</p>
<p>You can buy Stellaris from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Love roguelikes? Want a modern game that looks good and feels great to play? Jupiter Hell is what you need. The developers just released a nice big free upgrade too.</p>
<p>Version 1.3 Valhalla brings with it some pretty fun additions. There's a rework to multiple parts of the level generation, especially for Valhalla Spaceport, which has a new tough boss fight included. The Callisto area also got a big rework to add in some more variation and special mechanics involved with some other improvements to the level generation there, plus some weapon additions to each part of Callisto too. Some new visuals have been added, smoke now slows people down but not for the technician character who is "master of smoke" they say and plenty more.</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>

<p>It's been working great on Linux for a long time now but what about the Steam Deck? Well, I tested that too and it does appear to work very nicely, which is partly due to it having a native Vulkan renderer too but the UI also looks great on the smaller screen so they did a nice job there.</p>

      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fsr2-announce/" target="_blank">today revealed</a> AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0, the next-generation version of their impressive spatial upscaling tech that can really help improve performance.</p>
<p>For those who don't use it and are confused: the whole idea is that it produces high-resolution outputs from lower resolution inputs. It's one way to get good performance at 4K for example, for games that are a bit too resource intensive. It can work with many resolutions and the Steam Deck has FSR built-in.</p>
<p>There's limitations of course, and AMD explained these examples for FSR 1.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FSR 1.0 requires a high quality anti-aliased source image, which is not always available without making further changes to code and/or the engine.</li>
<li>Upscaling quality is unavoidably a function of the source resolution input. So with a low resolution source, there is just not enough information with a spatial upscaler for thin detail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bring on FSR 2.0 then! Which continues to be open source.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>"FSR 2.0 is the result of years of research from AMD, and is developed from the ground up. It uses cutting-edge temporal algorithms to reconstruct fine geometric and texture detail in the upscaled image, along with high-quality anti-aliasing."</em></p>
<p>Some of what's new in FSR 2.0 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivers similar or better than native image quality using temporal data.</li>
<li>Includes high-quality anti-aliasing.</li>
<li>Higher image quality than FSR 1.0 at all quality presets/resolutions.</li>
<li>Does not require dedicated Machine Learning (ML) hardware.</li>
<li>Boosts framerates in supported games across a wide range of products and platforms, both AMD and select competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will continue to work across all vendors too so NVIDIA and Intel will also benefit from this. Since it's open source, any developer can just pick it up and use it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FSR 2.0 temporal upscaling uses frame color, depth, and motion vectors in the rendering pipeline and leverages information from past frames to create very high-quality upscaled output and it also includes optimized high-quality anti-aliasing. Spatial upscaling solutions like FSR 1.0 use data from the current frame to create the upscaled output and rely on the separate anti-aliasing incorporated into a game’s rendering pipeline. Because of these differences, FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0 delivers significantly higher image quality than FSR 1.0 at all quality mode presets and screen resolutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example AMD included was DEATHLOOP which is adding support for it:</p>

<p>When will it actually be available? They're not saying other than a vague "Q2 2022". They will be attending GDC though next week to <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/next-generation-image-upscaling-for-games-presented-by-amd/886070" target="_blank">give a talk</a> on it.</p>

      <title>RimWorld gets a fresh Beta with big Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Building up a settlement on the go is going to be a reality soon for RimWorld fans, as a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/294100/view/3128319129435462402" target="_blank">Beta version</a> is now available and ready for testing with the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Planned to release in full on April 6, they're giving mod creators a little extra time to prepare as it's upgraded a lot of the internals for the Steam integration so quite a few mods could break with this Beta. They said everything but a few mods should work, and you can test by opting into the "steam_deck" Beta branch (no password).</p>
<p>"The update focuses on Steam Deck changes and improvements. The UI changes make it easier to read on-screen text and type with the Steam Deck keyboard, and menus look a lot better. The controls make more sense now with improved scrolling, zooming, time control, and touch screen navigation. Overall, playing RimWorld on Steam Deck should be a lot smoother with more intuitive controls. There may be more changes on the way to get RimWorld a “Verified” status for Steam Deck." — Ludeon Studios</p>
<p>Giving it a short test today, it actually feels pretty great on the Steam Deck, not that I have any real idea what I'm doing as it's been a very long time since I played (direct download previously hence no time on Steam) but here you go:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J5GY7HgaSo4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bbd9acbdede8c2cfa43516718308dd23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J5GY7HgaSo4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Even though it's a native Linux game, Valve tested compatibility for this one and set it to Proton 7.</em></p>

      <title>Lazy Galaxy 2 blends together an idle / clicker with some RTS elements out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your casual games? Lazy Galaxy 2 from Coldwild Games is out now with a Linux version and it's a wonderful idle / clicker game that also blends in some other strategy elements too.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>"Lazy Galaxy is an idle/clicker game with base-building and RTS elements. Lead an evil (albeit lazy) alien race to conquer the universe! Expand your base, fight vicious foes, and conquer the galaxies. Acquire combat experience and convert into candy, the most precious alien resource!"</p>
<p>I've been playing it as the developer sent over a key and it works great. It's a pretty perfect second-screen game to have while you're doing something else, or a game to leave in the background to keep coming back to. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HIHHx1Ew7KM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ffad87b8a8a7e6fc9e5b301d13ffc51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HIHHx1Ew7KM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Over email the developer told us it's their "attempt to improve its predecessor by making the base building deeper, changing the battle system, adding the custom maps to allow for more spatial conquest. Lazy Galaxy 2 can be enjoyed even if you have not played Lazy Galaxy 1. In Lazy Galaxy 2 achievements matter - unlocking in-game achievements adds permanent research that improves the gameplay. Micro-control is rewarded, but not necessary. You can idle out the battles or seek more active participation. Are you ready to conquer the universe?"</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conquer the galaxy! Build your base, build your fleet, fight the enemies</li>
<li>Hand-crafted campaign</li>
<li>Achievements matter! Unlocking in-game achievements adds permanent researches that improve the gameplay</li>
<li>Control unit abilities directly or idle it out! Micro-control is rewarded, but not necessary. You can idle out the battles or seek more active participation</li>
<li>Multiple development paths will add variety to incremental/base-building gameplay</li>
<li>Mod support: create your own campaign maps, ships, upgrades</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stormworks: Build and Rescue massively improves gamepad support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_and_Rescue/" target="_blank">Stormworks: Build and Rescue</a> is a popular sim where you design, create and pilot your own air sea rescue service and now it should work a lot better on Steam Deck and gamepads in general.</p>
<p>"Stormworks: Build and Rescue is a rich and dramatic physics playground. Take your custom-designed, block-based and programmable vehicles into fierce oceanic storms. Plan and execute thrilling rescues in a variety of challenging crisis scenarios. Export and share your meticulously designed vehicles and missions with other players via the Steam workshop."</p>
<p>Developer Geometa has put out multiple updates recently focused on gamepad improvements, with the latest patch released on March 11 that they said enabled you to "control the player character, as well as rebind all your controller settings, with a joypad or controller" which "dramatically improves the player experience when playing on the new Steam Deck". However, a few exceptions remain like the vehicle and add-on editor which needs either keyboard / mouse or touch screen to work with but they're getting there.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper is the latest indie hit with over 250,000 sales in one week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With gameplay that's a fun mix of Stardew Valley, Minecraft and survival games it seems Core Keeper has become an instant hit on Steam.</p>
<p>In only a single week, the developer has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4491783379133106123" target="_blank">announced</a> that 250,000 copies have been sold which shows that if you have the right idea there's plenty of room for indie games to push through the noise of hundreds of games releasing on Steam each month. Core Keeper seemed to come out of nowhere too, with not a whole lot said about it before release so they didn't even have a big marketing push either.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BIYcsYVxzPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ea0bcd27bddb6575af1ec256495fd2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BIYcsYVxzPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A game that definitely deserves the sales and praise it's getting. It works flawlessly across my main Linux PC and Steam Deck too. Although, I do find it a little bit too dark by default while exploring so I personally upped the brightness just a little so there's a bit less eye-strain when running out of torches to spam across the floor. Much like when Stardew first came to Linux, I feel completely enamoured by it and just want to play more.</p>
<p>While a big selling point is that you can play with friends online, I've been doing it entirely solo and the experience even there feels great. Lots of fun areas to dig through and explore and plenty of surprises waiting in the dark.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/58230/MacGuffins_Curse/" target="_blank">MacGuffin's Curse</a> from developer Brawsome originally released in 2012 and it just got a nice HD upgrade, along with a newly released Linux version.</p>
<p>A werewolf comedy puzzle adventure where players sneak and smash their way through sokoban-inspired puzzling rooms, meeting a cast of quirky quest-givers along the way. It was winner of Best Game Writing at Freeplay 2011, and was selected to be in the PAX10 at the inaugural PAX Australia.</p>
<p>From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MacGuffin's Curse has had a major renovation! Now with more pixels, and new builds for Windows, Mac, and releasing for the first time on Linux!</p>
<p>While the gameplay is the same, people playing on resolutions higher than 1024x768 (the OLD standard) will automatically default to HD assets, and have access to a widescreen display option!</p>
<p>Adding Linux as a new platform, and updating the Windows and Mac builds was achieved by updating a 10 year old Unity project. They said it couldn't be done! Now that MacGuffin's Curse has been resurrected from the dead it will hopefully keep pace with the ever changing Mac OS updates (Linux and Windows will probably be fine forever and ever).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the original trailer below, the developer did not provide a new one for the HD version:</p>

      <title>Google talk about their &#39;Windows emulator&#39; for Stadia and they use DXVK already</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During the ongoing Google for Games Developer Summit 2022 Keynote, one of the Google team just did a talk on "How to write a Windows emulator for Linux from scratch" to help <a href="https://stadia.google.com" target="_blank">Stadia</a>.</p>
<p>They already have some existing work available to developers who want it, including their "Stadia Porting Toolkit" which actually uses <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> to translate Direct3D to Vulkan (since Stadia is a Linux system). However, this translator seems to be their newer approach to running Windows games on Stadia.</p>
<p>With only three people working on it, presenter Marcin Undak said they were able to get some games to run but it's still in the R&amp;D phase and <em>not</em> production ready yet with it taking considerable time to work per-game. However, work is ongoing to hook it all up together with Wine and Proton (for 32-bit games specifically they said) which is one of the paths they will be considering going forwards.</p>
<p>There's already <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" target="_blank">Proton</a>, which are mentioned in the talk as well but it seems Google wanted something different. Why though? One major reason is how thin Stadia is as a platform. While it is Linux, it's stripped down to the core and doesn't have everything Wine needs to build. There's also a ton of things they don't have to care about that normal desktops do and so "90%" of Wine is simply not needed they said. Additionally, Wine is also apparently challenging when it comes to the build system and debugging.</p>
<p>Quite a technical talk but it's quite nicely presented, to give you a basic overview of what they're doing without going into super tech-heavy details to fry your brain if you're not a developer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8-N7wDCRohg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3b04c0c3e6c4d5e765920bfaa08a78c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8-N7wDCRohg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They are also finally about to open the Stadia store without the need to be signed in, so you will be able to actually look around. Incredible it took them this long to do such a basic thing, I can't imagine how many people that put off. Just think if Steam didn't let you view store pages or anything without a login.</p>

      <title>Google announces Steam for ChromeOS Chromebooks in &#39;Alpha&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's finally here in Alpha, Google and Valve have brought Steam to ChromeOS giving even more platforms using Linux a chance to get their gaming on.</p>
<p>This is another huge step for Linux gaming. Even though ChromeOS isn't exactly a traditional Linux distribution, the Steam client on it is still pretty much the same as the one available for Linux desktops and runs inside Google's special "borealis" Linux container.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6509411291647363903gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6509411291647363903gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Announced during the Google for Games Developer Summit 2022 Keynote, they said it's available for "select" Chromebooks for users to try.</p>
<p>They said to check out info on their community forum, which actually has nothing posted on it right now. Will update when it does with what info they provide. More to come…</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> — <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/155131703/steam-to-chrome-os?hl=en" target="_blank">their post</a> on the Chromebook community forum is now live, but it still doesn't actually give any info:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>As you may have already heard, our team is working with Valve to bring Steam to Chrome OS. We are very excited to share that we’ll be landing an early, alpha-quality version of Steam on Chrome OS in the Dev channel for a small set of Chromebooks coming soon. Please come back to the forum for more information!</div>

      <title>Two Point Hospital: Speedy Recovery expansion is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Studios might be currently working on Two Point Campus but they're not done with their modern take on Theme Hospital with the Two Point Hospital: Speedy Recovery DLC out now.</p>
<p>Speedy Recovery brings with it a new game mode, where you take command of an "extraordinary fleet of innovative and unorthodox ambulances". As incidents pop up via a new 'Dispatch' button, you use your new fleet of vehicles to deliver patients to hospitals all over Two Point County while you also cure their ailments. Actually sounds like a pretty great little expansion, much more interesting than the previous additions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k0lBqtnnDx8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4525637be0d9f906fa4435b2f9d52235.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k0lBqtnnDx8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it you get three new locations and features three new, fully animated treatment rooms. There's also 19 new illnesses, although only 6 are new visually like Under the Weather, Hive Mind and Snow Problem and they come with their new curing machines like the Honey Trap.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/two-point-hospital-speedy-recovery?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1901750/Two_Point_Hospital_Speedy_Recovery/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hyperbolica is a new Non-Euclidean adventure out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love games that might split your brain in half? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256230/Hyperbolica/" target="_blank">Hyperbolica</a> might just do that with the mind-bending world design based on Non-Euclidean curved space.</p>
<p>It's a thoroughly quirky adventure, with a layout that's similar to HyperRogue that shares the hyperbolic geometry style to it. However, these are vastly different games. While HyperRogue is a roguelike, Hyperbolica is a story-based adventure filled with exploration, mini-games and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4iLBN-30lQE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5bd2f9d0de175e84081c110610d01df9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4iLBN-30lQE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said to expect "With thousands of lines of dialogue, hours of unique gameplay, hundreds of NPCs, puzzles and games galore, and secret achievements, I hope Hyperbolica scratches that Non-Euclidean itch in the indie game community!".</p>
<p>Also in their own words on how to describe the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How is hyperbolic space different?</strong><br/>
Hyperbolic space allows exponentially more volume to fit in the same 'space' than you'd normally expect. This allows you to explore enormous areas while taking very little time to walk anywhere. You'll find that building a mental map of your surroundings becomes impossible. Lines can no longer be parallel. Traversing the map can result in unexpected rotations. And many more strange consequences that will make you question reality. You'll also explore spherical space, which has the opposite outcomes. For example, a reverse-perspective: Objects appear larger the farther away they are.<br/>
<br/>
It's a difficult concept to explain, and first-hand experience really is the best way to understand and build an intuition about these interesting geometries. Hyperbolica was created specifically for this purpose, to break the mold and to have a fun experience in an alternative universe different from our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the basic idea although it wasn't for me as the first-person perspective did actually hurt my eyes and brain a bit. Thinking it might be better in VR, since it advertises it, I tried that out I couldn't get the VR support to work at all. The Native Linux version would only launch normally, and with Proton it just gave a Unity error box.</p>

      <title>AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D releases April 20, more Zen processors on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has given a short and to the point video update on their latest products, including the exciting AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D processor. This will feature 8 cores, 16 threads, a base clock of 3.4GHz with a boost up to 4.5GHz, with a "default" 105W TDP, 96MB of L3 cache and based on the TSMC 7nm FinFET.</p>
<p>They've confirmed not only a price now of $449 which sounds reasonable for such a powerful unit, but also the date of April 20 for the public release. I've been waiting on upgrading from my ageing Intel processor and that might very well be a good time.</p>
<p>Not only that, more "mainstream" processors will be launching too. Here's the newer models:</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow, I didn't think I would be playing a fresh version of Space Invaders in 2022 but here I am sucked right into the new Beat Invaders from developer Raffaele Picca. <u>Note</u>: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>An arcade classic, reinvented for the modern era with neon visuals and a seriously good soundtrack that makes the action really come alive. This is a very musical game. The enemies movements and firing rates change with the music's beat and tempo too, so you end up getting completely absorbed by it. Especially in the later game, where the music gets faster and more complex leading to a thorough challenge.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6GscXmUNIqo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6d2c7a55e8b2a819143ad4561aa818d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6GscXmUNIqo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm completely hooked and I'm also amazingly <em>terrible</em> at it. I have absolutely no rhythm and I just generally always sucked at this type of game and yet I want to come back and play more — so it's absolutely doing a lot right for me to think that. With the upgrade system it's a good one to repeatedly play too, giving you a number of extras to unlock. Like everything though, I want more!</p>
<p>Tested working great on Steam Deck and my main Linux desktop, with performance looking good on both. The only minor annoyance was on the Plasma desktop, where fullscreen mode did not cover the panel leading to the very bottom of the gaming being cut-off.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Retro Space Invaders style gameplay with a next level roguelite action twist.</li>
<li>Upgrade your ship’s attack and defence systems between enemy waves.</li>
<li>Mini-events, Booster pickup items and different event waves make for challenging combos.</li>
<li>Improve your ship’s sub-system, unlock new weapons and convoy gadgets between runs.</li>
<li>Boss battle!  The chief music-hater makes his appearance, and it ain’t pretty!</li>
<li>High score challenge!  Compare your scores to your friends playing <strong>Beat Invaders</strong>, and try to beat their records!</li>
<li>Full mouse, keyboard and controller support.</li>
<li>Atmospheric electronic and vocal soundtrack with 22 tracks that sets the pace of your adversaries, making each round unique to its song.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Action-shooter The Ascent is Steam Deck Verified, adds a little tweak for Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979690/The_Ascent/" target="_blank">The Ascent</a> is a solo and co-op top-down looter-shooter from Neon Giant and Curve Games. It got Steam Deck Verified, and so the developer made a fun little tweak for players on Deck.</p>
<p>"The Ascent is a solo and co-op Action-shooter RPG, set on Veles, a packed cyberpunk world. Welcome to The Ascent Group arcology, a corporate-run metropolis stretching high into the sky and filled with creatures from all over the galaxy. You play as a worker, enslaved by the company that owns you and everyone else in your district. One day, you are suddenly caught in a vortex of catastrophic events: The Ascent Group shuts down for unknown reasons and the survival of your district is threatened. You must take up arms and embark on a new mission to find out what started it all."</p>
<p>In the game you use what they call a Cyberdeck, which allows you to hack various things in the game. For Deck players, they replaced it with a Steam Deck model. It's a really tiny change but still pretty fun to see developers do things like that, a nice little bit of fluff. From the developer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4914014891647341726gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4914014891647341726gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I played through a bit now myself and even on the default Ultra settings, it gives a mostly solid 30FPS which is quite impressive really.</p>
<p>Seems like a game that I could happily blast my way through. Here's a video of it on Deck:</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s some of the latest Steam Deck Verified titles including the popular Valheim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues going through the almighty Steam library to tag games through their Deck Verified certification for the Steam Deck. Let's have a look at the current numbers and what's new.</p>
<p>Currently across games, software and DLC there's a total of 1,352 that are either Verified (740) or Playable (612). Thankfully it's easier than ever to track, since Valve have the official categories available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=DeckCompatDate_DESC&amp;category1=998%2C994%2C21&amp;deck_compatibility=2%2C3&amp;os=win%2Clinux" target="_blank">Steam</a> and you can sort it by the time the latest compatibility happened.</p>
<p>Here's some of what's newly added:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Hat in Time (Verified)</li>
<li>Charlie Murder (Verified)</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5 (Playable)</li>
<li>GROUND BRANCH (Playable)</li>
<li>Kentucky Route Zero: PC Edition (Verified)</li>
<li>SLUDGE LIFE (Verified)</li>
<li>Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy (Verified)</li>
<li>Splitgate (Verified)</li>
<li>Super Hexagon (Playable)</li>
<li>THE KING OF FIGHTERS XV (Playable)</li>
<li>Tacoma (Verified)</li>
<li>Valheim (Verified - previously Playable, also swapped to Native from Proton)</li>
<li>Wreckfest (Verified)</li>
<li>Yes, Your Grace (Verified)</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you missed it, I did a quick video previously of Valheim running:</p>

      <title>Double Fine say Psychonauts 2 for Linux and macOS still coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While they're now pretty late on it, Double Fine say that the Linux and macOS dedicated builds of Psychonauts 2 are still actually on the way.</p>
<p>Must admit, I'm quite surprised at this point. It was crowdfunded on Fig back in 2016, with a full launch in August 2021 and in their latest <a href="https://www.fig.co/campaigns/psychonauts-2/updates/1504" target="_blank">Fig update</a> they said this under the rewards section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- If you are getting a physical copy of the game, <strong>we need to know if you want it on PC, Mac, or Linux</strong>! Yes, those last two things are real and we have been working on them at the studio. We take their quality seriously and have been doing our utmost to make sure that Mac and Linux versions meet our personal standards. You <em>do </em>need specify a version though; the game is coming on a nifty flash drive and we can't fit all three versions on on stick unless it was a big, like... baseball bat sized USB. So definitely tell us which you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam Deck, Valve has actually put the game through Deck Verified already using the Windows version in Proton giving it a "Playable" rating noting some text needs a manual bring-up of the keyboard, and the gamepad doesn't work everywhere needing touch input. Hopefully Double Fine will also look to fix those issues while they're at it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ghO7GcYfrjc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/727c1fc25ac1ba06a3ea57a355bcacc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ghO7GcYfrjc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Still fully expect this to be the last ever native Linux port of a Double Fine game, since they're now part of Xbox Game Studios.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update fixes buying games for some, touch input on &#39;Digital&#39; keyboard theme</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released the latest small update for the Steam Deck to fix up a couple of nuisances, a few of which were definitely annoying me.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3131696199140347447" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added fast scrolling to library views when holding up or down</li>
<li>Updated 'Download updates while playing' toggle to include a warning that downloading while playing games can severely impact performance</li>
<li>Updated UI text in various languages</li>
<li>Fixed 'Digital' keyboard theme touch input issues</li>
<li>Fixed Library sort order not saving when going away and coming back</li>
<li>Fixed issues with popup windows, enabling payment methods that open popup windows</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Digital keyboard theme issue was quite annoying, since it's the one I currently use. I was wondering why touch input suddenly stopped working. Good to see Valve has fixed that now as it's much faster to using touch input typing than moving the thumbstick around.</p>
<p>As for the last mentioned fix, that was perhaps even more annoying. Some payment systems require extra authentication, which needed a pop-up browser window to load these checks which didn't work and was reported to Valve by me on March 2 (it's possible others notified them before). A very essential fix of course, they need people to be able to actually buy stuff on Deck.</p>

      <title>Lorn&#39;s Lure: Prologue gives us a taste of its retro-styled climb-anywhere adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lorn's Lure: Prologue is basically a demo of a very moody looking first-person adventure, where you control an android being led through some vast structure while climbing all over the place.</p>
<p>"Lorn's Lure: Prologue is an atmospheric narrative first-person platformer with novel climb-anything mechanics and modernized retro 3D graphics. Leaving his home colony while tracking a mysterious glitch, an android finds himself in the midst of a vast and dangerous structure, completely hidden from his people's knowledge. Unable to go back, you must keep going to find out where he is being led."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OuJGTNFIpgg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e2699b044c64f83f2c66542611998ddb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OuJGTNFIpgg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After fumbling about in it myself for a while, I can safely say it suckered me right in. Brilliant atmosphere and there's really nothing I can think of that feels like it. Going to watch Lorn's Lure with great interest.</p>
<p>At a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark foreboding atmosphere</li>
<li>Retro 90s PC graphics, with a modern flair.</li>
<li>Uncover mysterious lore as you travel into the depths.</li>
<li>Jump, climb, slide, and scan your way around difficult challenges, using simple mechanics.</li>
<li>No "Parkour Ledges". Climb almost any vertical wall face using your pickaxes!</li>
<li>It's a tough game, but not frustrating! Mistakes are not punished by redoing lengthy sections.</li>
<li>Play fast or slow. Take in the sights as you traverse, or play as fast as a speed runner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prologue Features (compared with their older demo):</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller support</li>
<li>Completely new aesthetic</li>
<li>Quality, gameplay, and Audio settings, and a more robust main menu</li>
<li>High scores summary available from the level select menu</li>
<li>A secret unlockable challenge level</li>
<li>Fixes for design issues in the last demo</li>
<li>Many bug fixes that increase the quality level and smoothness of gameplay!</li>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 16: We Are All Doomed</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-15-square-cubed/" target="_blank">Part 15: Square Cubed</a></strong></p>
<p>The most appealing aspect of my QDI Advance 5/133 motherboard is its inclusion of AGP, PCI, and ISA expansion slots. This is what allows me to pair a GIGABYTE ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra AGP video card sold in 2001 with a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 WavEffects ISA sound card made in 1997. By having both dedicated MIDI and 3D acceleration hardware I can dip my toes into two different eras of gaming, straddling the divide between <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake III Arena</em>.</p>
<p>That said I have never been able to get Dave Taylor's original Linux port of <em>Doom</em> to run, as it was built with the deprecated a.out binary format rather than ELF. It would also lack any kind of music playback due to Linux not being supported by the proprietary DMX library used by <em>Doom</em>, although it was for this reason that the Linux source code was chosen for release in late 1997 by id Software to avoid infringing copyright with the DMX code bundled on MS-DOS.</p>
<p>Because of this, Linux users did not have long to wait for a better alternative to arrive, which by the turn of century proved to be LxDoom. LxDoom is derived from the influential Boom source port by TeamTNT, but it still functions very similar to the original <em>Doom</em> port for Linux. Installation is trivial using the lxdoom-1.4.4-0.i386.rpm and lxmusserv-0.94.2-0.i386.rpm packages available for download on SourceForge.</p>
<p>From there you can launch either the lsdoom or lxdoom binaries located in the /usr/games directory, the first functioning through SVGALib on a root console and the second displaying in an X11 window. The music was not working for me at first, but I resolved this by running the Red Hat sndconfig utility which created the proper MIDI sequencer device. This allowed the playmidi and KMid players to both have working playback as well.</p>
<p>Raven Software also released the source code to their <em>Doom</em> clone <em>Heretic</em> in 1999 with a source port to Linux coming soon after. Red Hat themselves archive RPM packages for Linux Heretic on their website, with the linux-heretic-1.03-2.i386.rpm, linux-heretic-vga-1.03-2.i386.rpm, and linux-heretic-fx11-1.03-2.i386.rpm packages all needing to be installed to have both vgaheretic and xaheretic binaries provided for SVGALib and X11 same as with LxDoom.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8990583241646899590gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8990583241646899590gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3555470241646896287gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3555470241646896287gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>As for the actual MIDI tracks produced, well, they have personality at least. After some reading I discovered that I am using a later budget variant of the Sound Blaster 16 which uses CQM Synthesis to emulate the functionality once provided by a dedicated Yamaha OPL-3 chip. Windows uses the Creative WaveSynth software synthesizer to improve MIDI playback, but on Linux I am left with a rough if workable FM synthesis outside of using something like TiMidity.</p>
<p>Now curious, I tried swapping the Sound Blaster 16 for a MediaVision Pro AudioSpectrum 16 SCSI with an actual YMF262-M OPL-3 chip installed. This required a little tinkering to find the right I/O, IRQ, and DMA settings as it is not an ISA PnP card. While with Windows 98 I could hear a subtle difference, on Linux it sounded much the same. Even more unusual is the fact that playing an identical MIDI file from playmidi, KMid, and lxmusserv does produce different results.</p>
<p>Regardless, launching either LxDoom or Linux Heretic with SVGALib from the command line is still an authentic experience you would be hard pressed to find outside of playing the games on MS-DOS. Because LxDoom is limit removing with Boom support you also have access to a great deal of custom level sets and total conversions alongside <em>Doom</em>, <em>Doom II</em>, and <em>Final Doom</em> however, including John Romero's <em>SIGIL</em> when loaded with the compatibility WAD file.</p>
<p>Sadly neither Linux Hexen or the later forked HHexen source ports support MIDI music playback through /dev/sequencer like LxDoom and Linux Heretic do, making <em>HeXen</em> lack for me the main appeal of playing the game on vintage hardware as opposed to just using a modern source port. <em>Strife</em> meanwhile did not see a reverse engineered Linux version emerge until almost a decade after these initial <em>Doom</em> engine source ports were first released.</p>
<p>All of the community ports have come a long way since then of course. LxDoom would later form the basis of PrBoom, which was the first <em>Doom</em> source port I spent a great deal of time with as it was packaged alongside <em>Freedoom</em> on Fedora. After covering six first person shooters in a row though, and another four before that, the time has come to broaden our horizons again, and welcome you all into the llama lair.</p>

      <title>Apex Legends now broken on Steam Deck and Linux desktops (update: fixed)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 15/03/22</strong> - It's now fixed, with no word again from anyone. The EAC file was just put back nearly ~9 hours later.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Even though <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a> was marked officially Steam Deck Verified by Valve on March 9, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">that we covered in an article</a>, it's now been updated and it's broken on Steam Deck and Linux desktops.</p>
<p>It's still not really clear what's going on. No announcement was made previously from any party. Valve didn't say anything, Respawn (the developer) didn't and EA (the publisher) also stayed silent. It just seemed to go through Deck Verified, and showed the whole world it worked as it was properly live on the Steam store and in your Steam Library on Deck. Now, a patch came in and it has removed the Linux Easy Anti-Cheat file so the game will boot you out telling you it's not working.</p>
<p>This is pretty <em>frustrating</em>. We've talked a couple of times now across articles and videos on issues with Deck Verified, and this certainly doesn't help. There's always going to be teething issues with a new platform of course but this isn't even a Top 100 title, Apex is constantly in the <u>Top 10</u> on Steam. To have it break like this even though it's Deck Verified? What the heck is going on?</p>
<p>It does bring up other questions now too like: how long is the lag between a major game getting an upgrade, and it going through Deck Verified again to check it works? What about smaller games, do they have to wait longer? The list of questions goes on.</p>
<p>Such a shame, as it became an instant favourite of mine and worked so nicely on Deck:</p>

      <title>Tile-based puzzler Bean and Nothingness looks sweet, now has a Linux version too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bean and Nothingness is one we missed from February that added a Linux version and it appears like it might be a great pick if you love tile-based puzzlers.</p>
<p>In the game you wield a special wand that can turn beans into monsters, which varies based on what recipes are available during each puzzle. It's pretty unique sounding and it looks quite sweet too but sadly it's gone pretty unnoticed. To progress you create, manipulate, and destroy these monsters in the right places and at the right times; they can both help you and hinder you as you try to solve each puzzle.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GZ7PRBcBfE0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99c7e4fba191b8cf29f181857e566b1a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GZ7PRBcBfE0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite a lot of content to play through too, with the developer saying there's over 180 puzzles where the difficulty ranges from easy to "extremely challenging" so it might be quite the brain-tickler further in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expect puzzles that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge you to come up with creative ideas</li>
<li>Require you to make efficient use of resources</li>
<li>Test your ability to manage "tactics"-like, grid-based interactions</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Features</p>
<ul>
<li>A colour-blind-friendly mode gives the beans distinct shapes.</li>
<li>Controller is supported, although the game is best experienced on keyboard.</li>
<li>Controls are customizable.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706090/Bean_and_Nothingness/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CD Projekt RED &#39;working closely with Valve&#39; as The Witcher 3 is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Witcher 3 got bumped up from Playable to Verified for the Steam Deck around the initial Deck release, and developer CD Projekt RED has released a statement on it now.</p>
<p>A game that was supposed to gain official SteamOS support back when the original Steam Machines released, with Valve showing a huge <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4826931991647248499gol1.jpg" target="_blank">splash image</a> on the Steam homepage to announce it coming. It was quickly removed, which Valve and CDPR stayed silent on afterwards. How things change huh?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/292030/announcements/detail/4712459761457742331" target="_blank">the announcement</a> the developer said they're "working closely with Valve on the compatibility and performance aspects of our games on the Steam Deck. The goal is to provide the best possible Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 experience on this platform, while keeping in mind its unique hardware characteristics" and they also said not to expect any updates for their "legacy" titles like the original Witcher game.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it running on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5z69VLgv_PQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d0627a627548c2f34d1561da0d31b3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5z69VLgv_PQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to know more developers are paying attention now. Let's hope this continues for a very long time.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile getting gamepad support, should work better on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not released yet but Path of Exile is getting a fresh Beta update to bring gamepad support, and the developer has asked people with a Steam Deck to get testing when it's up. One of the most popular free to play RPGs around, Path of Exile regularly sees over 30,000 players online at the same time each day.</p>
<p>Like a lot of developers, they of course want their game to work well on Deck. In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/238960/view/3135073898858179556" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the upcoming 3.17.3 Patch will bring Beta support for gamepads. It will stay in Beta until the 3.18 expansion. Once live, you'll be able to change the Input Method in the options simply to "Gamepad (Beta)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6211379651647253394gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6211379651647253394gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once it's up, I'll be giving it a test to see how it feels and will likely do a new video. Be sure to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on YouTube</a> for when that goes live.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Path of Exile on Steam Deck? Do you already play it on a Linux desktop? Let us know what you think in the comments.</p>

      <title>Valve sent the developer of Lutris a Steam Deck to help development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>News I'm sure many Linux fans will be happy to see — Valve <a href="https://twitter.com/LutrisGaming/status/1502786834908135424" target="_blank">sent over</a> a Steam Deck to the developer of <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>, the free and open source game manager.</p>
<p>One of the most popular applications for gaming on Linux, Lutris can help you manage games across various different sources including Humble Bundle, GOG, Steam, Epic Games, EA Origin, Ubisoft, Emulators and more. Currently though, getting it working on Steam Deck properly would involve using developer mode as it doesn't have a proper Flatpak package available from Flathub (the current one is not official and doesn't work well).</p>
<p>Having a Steam Deck to hand should help further development on the Flatpak, as well as hooking up anything special needed for the Steam Deck specifically.</p>

      <title>Minecraft launcher PolyMC version 1.1.0 is out now with an essential Steam Deck option</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://polymc.org/" target="_blank">PolyMC</a> is a fork of the popular MultiMC launcher for Minecraft, giving you an easy way to install and manage mods. This release also brings an essential feature needed on the Steam Deck. You might be familiar with PolyMC, as it was the launcher I featured in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/getting-minecraft-and-mods-on-steam-deck-is-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">my Steam Deck guide</a>, which now means you don't need to use the Beta version!</p>
<p>This new release brings with it bug fixes, a few feature changes and these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New option to close PolyMC after launch by @binex-dsk in #79</li>
<li>Now detects Java from environment by @muscaln in #46</li>
<li>New <code class="inline-code">Open page &amp; copy code</code> button in MSA login dialog by @Scrumplex in #88</li>
<li>Added StartupWMClass to .desktop file so DEs can behave by @danielhuang in #95</li>
<li>Added PolyMC news by @dada513 in #151</li>
<li>Added CurseForge and Modrinth mod downloader by @timoreo22 in #64 #129 #183 #205 #207 and @flowln in #193 #221</li>
<li>New CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for PolyMC logos and branding by @ZekeSmith in #149</li>
<li>Added MSA-Client-ID override in UI by @Scrumplex in #161</li>
<li>Added missing tooltip for instance export in #176</li>
<li>Added MSA Client ID change detection and prompt by @Scrumplex in #180</li>
<li>Added Matrix space link by @dada513 in #243 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam Deck, you absolutely need that option to close PolyMC after launch, otherwise it will flicker between PolyMC and Minecraft in Gaming Mode.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to mod Stardew Valley on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get Stardew Valley setup on the Steam Deck with mods? It's quite easy to do but there's a few steps you have to go through, here's a guide on what to do.</p>
<p>Unlike some games, Stardew doesn't offer up the Steam Workshop and instead uses the standalone <a href="https://smapi.io/" target="_blank">SMAPI</a>. The good news is that it works well on Linux too. First up, here's the usual video guide and below will be text for those that prefer to read:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CrrWtqdbvC4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/60c1c48bc69622fa24b9606491830a07.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CrrWtqdbvC4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>This video guide is linked in the official <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing_SMAPI_on_Linux#Steam_Deck" target="_blank">SMAPI Wiki</a>.</em></p>
<p>Text guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load up a web browser and head to the <a href="https://smapi.io/" target="_blank">SMAPI website</a>, then hit the big download button.</li>
<li>Extract the archive and load up your Downloads folder in the Dolphin file manager.</li>
<li>Open the Konsole terminal application, and drag the "install on Linux.sh" file into the Konsole window. Follow the onscreen instructions.</li>
<li>You can find mods on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley" target="_blank">NexusMods</a>, although you need to be registered and logged in to download.</li>
<li>Pick a mod, download it and then place the mod folder extracted from the archive download into your Mods folder in the Stardew Valley install folder. You can find the installed folder by right clicking the game in Steam, going to Properties, Local Files and clicking Browse Local Files.</li>
<li>Disable the SMAPI terminal, otherwise the game will not display properly in Gaming Mode (the main Deck UI). Do this by installing any text editor in the Discover Software Centre. In your Stardew installed folder, look for the file named "StardewValley" (with no extension) and open it up. Adjust where it says SKIP_TERMINAL=false to SKIP_TERMINAL=true and save.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can buy Stardew Valley for Steam Deck on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stardew-valley?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Verified has issues, Grand Theft Auto V edition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As I continue to use the Steam Deck that Valve sent over for both work and play, I tried Grand Theft Auto V and the initial setup was a massive nuisance. <u>See also</u>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/how-valve-can-make-the-deck-verified-program-better/" target="_blank">How Valve Can Make the Deck Verified Program Better</a></p>
<p>This is a game that has gone through verification, to get a Deck "Playable" rating. This means it should work well but may have some minor annoyances like small text or a part requiring the touch screen. Here though, it was far worse and this is the short story of a semi-eventful Saturday night where I just wanted to play a game that I picked carefully enough — or so I thought.</p>
<p>On first launch with Proton 7, what it was verified against, it tells you it needs to install the Rockstar Launcher before you can play. The annoyance begins here of course as I've already waited on a 100GB download. I was at least pre-warned on this since I read the compatibility note. Fine then, let's do it. Except during the launcher install Rockstar gave an error telling me that it simply couldn't proceed. It gave an option to retry with a button I clicked, but that totally <em>failed</em> again. Clearly not a good experience right away. Playable — apparently.</p>
<p>So the next step was of course to restart the game entirely. Hit the Steam button for the Overlay, tell it to exit the game. Then reload it. Hooray! This got it to install the launcher and my face lights up with joy and anticipation to drive around and do silly things. Now it tells me I need an activation code. What code? Nothing told me I needed a code when I purchased it on Steam. Thinking it's a launcher error, I reloaded and it then broke <em>completely</em>. The launcher just didn't load any more and it dumped me back into my Steam Library. Tried three times, same problem. Tried a reboot, the issue persisted.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm annoyed. I think anyone would be. I decided to swap it over to Proton Experimental (tip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">here's a guide on swapping Proton</a> versions on Steam Deck), and that actually worked! I could get the launcher to load without fail through multiple tries but I still needed a code. Of course, normally, the desktop Steam client would've had a pop-up to tell you that you have a CD Key and the game might ask for it - no such thing happens on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Searching around, the CD Key can be found in the COG icon menu of the game in your Steam Library. Then go to Manage and the CD Key option is in there. Valve even give an option to copy it, which I did. Going back to the game, I couldn't figure out how to paste it in as the field just wouldn't get focus. After randomly clicking inside and around the input field, <em>eventually</em> i got the Steam Deck Keyboard to work with it but the paste button did nothing. A couple tries of this and eventually it pasted the key in properly. That was about <u>30</u> minutes after first clicking play.</p>
<p>For me, I don't really think any experience like that should be in the Playable category. Did no testing ever find any of these issues? How deep and repeated is the Deck Verified testing on each game? We really have no clue.</p>
<p>Thankfully, at least when it comes to performance, GTA V runs rather swimmingly on the Steam Deck so I've no complaints at all there.</p>
<p>I can name other titles where there's more issues like performance being problematic and yet they have a fully Verified tag on them. Vampire Survivors goes into single digit FPS towards the end of a battle when performance is most important, Horizon Zero Dawn can do too in places (even LinusTechTips noted that too, and we got a shout out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNt_ReLwk40" target="_blank">their recent video</a>) and there's others. Borderlands 3 is another Playable that in places drops hard and stutters a lot. <em>The two previous were mentioned in my initial <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck review</a> in case you missed it.</em></p>
<p>The thing to remember is that for something to succeed we also need to talk about shortcomings and general issues. This is not an attempt to derail the hype and momentum, more of a wish to see things get better.</p>
<p>Really, Valve needs to take another look at how they run Deck Verified if trust in it is to be a real thing. Otherwise, like my friend Nick from The Linux Experiment said in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/four-nerds-talk-about-steam-deck-valve-linux-and-more/" target="_blank">big collaboration video</a>, the green Verified tick will end up meaningless if strict standards aren't followed. The same of course applies to the Playable category too.</p>
<p>Additionally, could we please stop slapping a launcher on everything?</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a 15FPS option, new keyboard themes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has a fresh upgrade out for the Steam Deck giving you even more performance control, plus you can now buy new keyboard themes in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/c/keyboard" target="_blank">Points Shop</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I think Valve could improve is getting to the various sections on Steam. The Deck interface is quite limited overall, with very few shortcuts to the many parts of Steam available. The Points Shop for example, you can access that by going into the main Settings, go to Keyboard and there's a Points Shop button there to go direct to the Keyboard section. Additionally, when you buy a new Keyboard theme, they don't show in the list until a reboot it seems but you can equip them directly from the store page.</p>
<p>Here's two of the new keyboard themes:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12961985211647076883gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12961985211647076883gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15503162071647076884gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15503162071647076884gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Added 15 fps option to the Framerate Limit slider in the QAM performance menu.</li>
<li>Added progress information to SD card format operations.</li>
<li>Added first batch of keyboard themes to the Points Shop.</li>
<li>Added gamepad support to the Steam Points Award dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed "Use Touchscreen" flashing on some web pages.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the Software Update UI would stop making progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Controller Configuration</p>
<ul>
<li>Added numeric display of values to Setting sliders.</li>
<li>Added the ability to manually enter a specific value on Setting sliders.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the last change of a Setting slider wouldn't save.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where physical inputs sometimes disappeared while editing Action Set Layers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine 7.4 changes the default theme and more PE conversion work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another couple of weeks and even more work has been done on the Windows compatibility layer <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.4" target="_blank">Wine in development version 7.4</a> that's out now.</p>
<p>This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>'Light' theme enabled by default.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d library.</li>
<li>WineD3D, D3D12 and DXGI modules converted to PE.</li>
<li>More large scale cleanups to support 'long' type.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As we explained previously: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>Only 14 bugs were noted as solved with this release and no notable games were listed in the notes on it.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher now on Flathub, even easier to run Epic Games on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher, the community-made open source app for the Epic Games Store, is now available as a Flatpak on Flathub making it even easier to install and setup on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Work that had been ongoing for a while, with multiple upgrades and tweaks needed to get there. Initially it had a problem finding Proton and Wine versions installed that I spoke with the developer of Heroic on today and now it's solved. Thanks to this, it makes getting both Epic Games and GOG onto the Steam Deck and Linux desktops just a few button clicks away.</p>
<p>Here's a short and to the point updated video guide for the Steam Deck including SD Card access:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HrTg0mDm2nA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46f2f00a2fc786d2a3fbcfcebdcd904c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HrTg0mDm2nA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><u>Text Guide:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Load up the Discover Software Centre (in desktop mode) and search for Heroic Games Launcher if you're on a Steam Deck, or install direct from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl" target="_blank">Flathub</a> if you're on desktop Linux.</li>
<li>Install it, launch it and login with either Epic or GOG.</li>
<li>Pick games, install, done. Yes it's now that <em>easy</em>.</li>
<li>Adding to Steam: open the Games menu at the top of Steam -&gt; Add a Non-Steam Game, find Heroic and add it.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>SD Card access on Steam Deck:</u></p>
<p>Either run this in terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --filesystem=/your/sd/card/address/ com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl</code></p>
<p>You can find the correct address using the Dolphin file manager, scrolling down to the Removable Devices and opening Primary. Near the top of the window where it lists the folder name, click next to it and the address will appear for you to copy. For example mine is "/run/media/mmcblk0p1/", which might be the same across most Decks.</p>
<p><em>Or</em> you can install <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal" target="_blank">Flatseal</a>, which allows you to adjust permissions of Flatpak packages. With that, you can load it and pick the Heroic Games Launcher, scroll down in the right panel to Filesystem and add a new entry in the box with no trailing slash.</p>
<p>When you've enabled SD Card access, make sure to <strong>reload</strong> the Heroic app so it picks up the new permission.</p>
<p><em>Enjoy all the free games Epic keeps throwing at you.</em></p>

      <title>Thoroughly odd sounding free adventure Mondealy: Day One arrives on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1591570/Mondealy_Day_One/" target="_blank">Mondealy: Day One</a> from developer uglycoal seems pretty quirky and it's also free, although something of a prologue / demo for an upcoming bigger game.</p>
<p>"Assume the role of Michael, an ordinary guy who discovered the underground pathway leading into Dargratt - the unexplored underground kingdom. Michael meets the royal family through an odd set of events and coincidences, and now it is up to them to decide what is going to happen with him."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QPjZWUs4Giw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/775af31bc8b39865ed737e9229b3ef90.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QPjZWUs4Giw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spend a day in the underground kingdom - meet, explore, unravel!</li>
<li>Meet flamboyant and deep characters - Inhabitants of both worlds, the one above and the one beneath, who are eager to share their stories and vision with you. While they may ask you for help, it is up to you whether you are willing to help them or not.</li>
<li>Explore both the game's worlds - the underground city and nearby districts, the castle with its inhabitants, the mysterious home town on the surface as well as the characters' residences await exploration. Things might look ordinary, but how ordinary are they, and what lies beneath?</li>
<li>Uncover a portion of the main storyline and side quests - You will gain access to the introduction of the game, which will gradually immerse you into the underworld with its laws, beliefs, events, and inhabitants. The more you investigate - the more you learn, and be rewarded with additional stories to tell and events to experience.</li>
<li>In-game gallery - The in-game character gallery will allow the most dedicated and curious players to learn more about the characters you can meet while playing Mondealy. Discover how they were created, their history in-game, and the inspiration behind them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can grab it free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1591570/Mondealy_Day_One/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, with the developer noting the full version will also have Linux support.</p>

      <title>Getting Minecraft and mods on Steam Deck is nice and simple</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get Minecraft working easily on Steam Deck or a normal Linux desktop without much fuss? Here's one way you could do it and it makes it easy. For this I picked the PolyMC launcher (a fork of MultiMC) available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.polymc.PolyMC" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, as the current official Minecraft launcher Flatpak doesn't save your password on Steam Deck and PolyMC of course deals with modding too.</p>
<p>Here's a recent video guide for you, with text steps below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6E2Enr5S78k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ddfde8cd9283915b3fd307e2e4fda743.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6E2Enr5S78k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You will find this video also on the Steam Deck section of the <a href="https://polymc.org/wiki/installing/linux/steam-deck/" target="_blank">PolyMC Wiki</a>!</p>
<p>Text steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install PolyMC from the Discover Software Centre on Steam Deck, or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.polymc.PolyMC" target="_blank">Flathub</a> directly for desktop Linux.</li>
<li>Launch PolyMC and add your account in the top right corner. <em>It supports both Mojang and Microsoft logins.</em></li>
<li>Go into the main PolyMC Settings, click Minecraft in the left panel and click the option to close PolyMC when the game window opens. Otherwise, loading in Game Mode / Deck UI on Steam Deck it will flicker between the two windows.</li>
<li>Ensure in the PolyMC Settings that Java is set to the latest version, which is needed for the latest Minecraft.</li>
<li>Click Add Instance in the top left, then pick either normal Minecraft or find some mods with the built-in search and it installs everything you need for you.</li>
<li>To be able to launch directly from Steam: go to the Games menu up the top -&gt; click add a Non-Steam game and then find PolyMC in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some YouTube comments suggested trying out some optimized modpacks, but really I didn't see a big enough difference in terms of performance or power use to make them actually worth it on Deck compared with vanilla Minecraft when testing on the same map seed. Controller mods were also suggested, but they're rarely updated and often only work with specific Minecraft versions so sticking with Steam Input and just adjusting a few keys is the best choice for that.</p>

      <title>Space Crew: Legendary Edition gets Steam Deck fixes, noted as Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1176710/Space_Crew_Legendary_Edition/" target="_blank">Space Crew: Legendary Edition</a> is another game that has been updated for the Steam Deck, with official verification noting it as Playable.</p>
<p>Deck Verified for this title was done a while ago, so with these fixes it should be upgraded to Verified as the notes from Valve talked about the Launcher and Text Input. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1176710/announcements/detail/5242758619716585654" target="_blank">release notes</a> are clear that the developer solved both issues with the virtual keyboard now automatic and launcher features now directly in the game. Nice to see another developer act to improve their game!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yu4aHIiSNH0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/322882f16d5cf1659263057238bb137c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yu4aHIiSNH0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's in the Legendary Edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brand new campaign – Players will take on a droid army led by rogue androids previously allied with the United Defence Force. Battle against a whole host of new Enemy Champions and ships across new missions, with new gear, liveries and upgrades available for victorious Captains to unlock.</li>
<li>Away Team missions – Leave your ship and venture on foot for the first time with three of your crew onto outposts and large vessels in the all NEW Away Team missions. Selecting the right team will be critical for survival as Away Team missions consist of exploration, puzzles, or combat… sometimes even against the clock!</li>
<li> Legendary Crew members - Build and personalise your ultimate crew by discovering and rescuing legendary crew members with amazing abilities and superior stats, to bolster your efforts against the enemy threat.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Even Xbox Game Studios are talking about Steam Deck compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes, even a fair few games that Microsoft / Xbox publish will work out of the box on the Steam Deck. As Xbox Game Studios announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/3090835/view/3112553992726030833" target="_blank">post on Steam</a>, it shows just how much of a shift the Steam Deck is causing for Linux gaming as a whole to have them talk about it.</p>
<p>Contrary to what some other sites will tell you though, Microsoft didn't mark them as Verified, Valve did. As another point, I've seen a few other journalist say some games "won't work", but even the official post says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's up to our studios how they fit Steam Deck integration for their games into their busy schedules, and with a lot of great stuff already in the works some titles may take longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft aren't telling studios not to, or that they <em>won't</em>: just that some will take time.</p>
<p>Here's what's Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>DEATHLOOP</li>
<li>Psychonauts 2</li>
<li>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</li>
<li>The Evil Within</li>
<li>Fallout Shelter</li>
<li>Prey</li>
<li>Battletoads</li>
<li>Max: The Curse of Brotherhood</li>
</ul>
<p>Playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea of Thieves</li>
<li>Fallout 4</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 4</li>
<li>Quantum Break</li>
<li>State of Decay: YOSE</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiously, Microsoft has listed these titles as currently unsupported due to anti-cheat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gears 5</li>
<li>Halo MCC</li>
<li>Halo Infinite</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator X</li>
</ul>
<p>Last we checked, Halo Infinite was not due to anti-cheat but just issues with VKD3D-Proton. It should hopefully eventually get working properly. As for the Halo Masterchief Collection, that works in single-player but not the main online multiplayer and I even showed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary-single-player-works-fine-on-linux-with-steam-play-proton/" target="_blank">Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/halo-2-anniversary-on-linux-steamplay/" target="_blank">Halo 2</a> plus <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/07/halo-3-and-halo-reach-may-need-this-audio-fix-on-linux-with-steam-play-proton/" target="_blank">Halo 3 and Halo Reach</a> working on a normal Linux desktop some time ago.</p>

      <title>Four nerds talk about Steam Deck, Valve, Linux and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I had the absolute pleasure of a very long and relaxed chat with some other Linux content creators: Nick from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheLinuxExperiment" target="_blank">The Linux Experiment</a>, Jason from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LinuxForEveryone" target="_blank">Linux For Everyone</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GardinerBryant" target="_blank">Gardiner Bryant</a>. Talking through various points including Linux, Valve, Steam, Steam Machines, Steam Deck and more.</p>
<p>First up, a short teaser clip on the Steam Machines and what happened:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8R9fgu8WKlk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bef5d66502f4d30225a83a668dd1a1dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8R9fgu8WKlk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a companion clip, there's also the complete opposite that I thought would be good to show next to this on how the Steam Deck has changed our gaming because the experience is just so different:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PoG1yQr4D2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/600c8c7d9784e50174ef89b408af9c9b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PoG1yQr4D2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Finally, you will want to grab a drink and snack for this one, as here's Jason's edit of the full thing. One key point is that Jason was recording, and doing everything directly from his Steam Deck which overall worked pretty well.</p>
<p>Strap yourself in, it's a bit of a ride:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lzjmPmfLB-o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70c7184dda445232bd980e8311c93264.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lzjmPmfLB-o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you prefer podcast form, Jason <a href="https://www.linux4everyone.com/57-steam-deck-dream-team" target="_blank">has you covered</a> too.</p>

      <title>Windows drivers roll out for Steam Deck but Valve won&#39;t support it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out of the box, the Steam Deck comes with SteamOS 3 Linux and overall apart from early quirks and bugs it does work very well but they're now providing Windows drivers — with a big caveat.</p>
<p>This was announced <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3131696199122435100" target="_blank">on Steam</a> today, for those who do want to put up with Windows (not me). There's a few notes they included on it but the biggest and most important is that Valve will not actually be supporting Windows on Deck in any way. It was put very clearly as Valve said "we are providing these resources as is and are unfortunately unable to offer 'Windows on Deck' support".</p>
<p>People are free to do what they want with it, unlike more traditional "consoles" but the point is that for official support, you need to use SteamOS.</p>
<p>The quick notes Valve included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For now you can only perform a full Windows install. While Steam Deck is fully capable of dual-boot, the SteamOS installer that provides a dual-boot wizard isn't ready yet.</li>
<li>Also for now, you can only install Windows 10. Windows 11 requires a new BIOS that is currently in the pipe (which provides fTPM support) and will be shipping soon.</li>
<li>Drivers are provided for GPU, WiFi, and Bluetooth. Audio drivers are still in the works with AMD and other parties - but you'll still be able to use Bluetooth or USB-C audio with Windows on Deck.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Atmospheric puzzle game The Last Cube is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I remember playing the demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/903630/The_Last_Cube/" target="_blank">The Last Cube</a> and being quite amazed at how good it was, and the full game is out now. The game features, as the name might suggest, a Cube — that's you. Rolling around on your sides to get through the map and various puzzles. How Improx Games managed to make such a thing entertaining is still a mystery, it has such wonderful design to it.</p>
<p>The Last Cube features a sticker system, allowing you to stamp abilities onto your cube's sides. Some will allow you to dash through barriers, others will create makeshift stairs, and some grant the ability to spin in place for easy manoeuvring in tight places. Positioning your cube to acquire the desired stickers on the correct surface can range from pleasingly simplistic, to masochistic head scratchers as you scramble through The Last Cube's 100+ puzzles. New mechanics are introduced at a breezy clip, rapidly expanding one's perception of what your cube is capable of.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ldkEU6NMP4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/208517107e0b1cc9501ea254564a8370.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ldkEU6NMP4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We’ve spent five years putting together The Last Cube, so we’re very eager to see how quickly people can solve our most intricate brain teasers," said Max Samarin, creative director at Improx Games. "There’s a lot to unpack in the game, between the mandatory puzzles, the hidden ones, and uncovering the lore of the Cube Planet."</p>

      <title>Crown of Pain could turn into the next great match-3 RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you like Match 3 games? Well, I do! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651090/Crown_of_Pain/" target="_blank">Crown of Pain</a> mixes together the idea of matching tiles but blends in turn-based RPG battles too.</p>
<p>Now in Early Access from Jagit Games, Coldwild Games it might be a little rough going in with not enough of an explanation for now but you can quickly piece together what tiles will help. Visually quite simple with the pixel art, but the atmosphere is good enough to pull you in for that "just one more run" feeling that I got from a great many other games.</p>
<p>The main gameplay consists of building up a team of heroes, then battling through the tile-matching section where matching the right tiles together will launch attacks, or managing to get combinations together for special abilities. As you progress, you also get to upgrade each individual hero too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uVmp7ohlSPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6fcbeb515e23fc7d48c80c8618c3836a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uVmp7ohlSPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's simple and effective, exactly what you want in a blending of these two genres together. Can't wait to see how it evolves during Early Access which the developer said could continue up to a year for the full release. As a debut game from Latvia-based solo dev Jagit Games it's good.</p>

      <title>Netherguild brings a turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawling demo to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Netherguild is a turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawler, where you command expeditions below the earth in a desperate attempt to cure a strange plague. A proper demo is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1464220/Netherguild/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> (also <a href="https://superobot1.itch.io/netherguild" target="_blank">itch.io</a> as before). Giving you a chance to explore, camp, and fight as far as you can before heading back to resupply.</p>
<p>I've had a lot of fun with this one at various points in its development, covering it here on GOL some time ago.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xWMuahIgERw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e59e9a64055d0ead79953b2ba9537bc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xWMuahIgERw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn based combat</strong> that gets more intense the further you delve.</li>
<li><strong>Oddities:</strong> Underground text based encounters provide you with choices and opportunities that affect your expedition.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Management</strong> over the course of your runs, in the form of HP, food (which provides healing when eaten around bonfires as well as buffs and debuffs), and limited use abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Random characters:</strong> 4 classes with at least 3 backgrounds each. Different backgrounds mean different skill trees, character personalities and more.</li>
<li><strong>Original fantasy world:</strong> Low fantasy with no magic, but not grimdark!</li>
<li><strong>Cute &amp; Unique Voxel Aesthetic</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due for an Early Access release later this year, where the developer estimate another few years work until it's properly finished but what's already there is a lot of fun and you can play it through many times. Absolutely worth a look.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get the EA App on Steam Deck with Bottles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another guide for you today. For those of you who want to use the EA App on the Steam Deck (or a Linux desktop!), here's one of the possible ways to do it using <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>.</p>
<p>Bottles is a free and open source application with one purpose, to make managing Windows games on Linux a little bit easier. It's going through plenty of development and is improving at a rapid pace, so I decided (after many requests) to take it for a spin. First up, here's the video guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZddR273hKEg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af0581744b91c5c8dcb568fc925a4ee4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZddR273hKEg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the Bottles application from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.usebottles.bottles" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On Steam Deck, it's available via the Discover software centre.</li>
<li>Load it up, and hit the "Create a new Bottle" button and give it a name.</li>
<li>Once done, go into the new Bottle by clicking it and head to the "Installers" menu and pick the EA Launcher.</li>
<li>Wait a while, and once done it should launch. That's it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottles does thankfully make the setup really easy, since it handles the management of everything for you.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the video though, the EA App is pretty terrible overall and likes to freeze up but once going properly it's generally okay. As for the performance test of Battlefield V, well that speaks for itself. Like most games running through Wine / Proton, they need to build up a good shader cache before they go from a stuttery mess to butter smooth and that can take a while.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="http://https://www.humblebundle.com/?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Choice</a> currently has Mass Effect Legendary Edition which you can install with this method.</p>

      <title>Blender 3.1 is out with better performance, new advanced features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blender, the all-in-one tool for 3D creation including modelling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and more has a big upgrade out with <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-1/" target="_blank">version 3.1</a>.</p>
<p>Full release notes can be seen on the <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/3.1" target="_blank">Blender Wiki</a> with a couple of highlights including: exporting .obj files is now orders of magnitude faster, playback in the 3D Viewport is now much faster, Geometry Nodes performance is much better with many nodes now multi-threaded, a new Point Cloud object can be rendered directly with Cycles to create sand, water splashes, particles or even motion graphics and lots more.</p>
<p>Here's their fancy overview video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BCi0QRM1ADY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cf3e93e4e51dc8068a2b8fe02fed2c0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BCi0QRM1ADY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Fun fact: a bunch of recent videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube</a> were fully edited in Blender. My usual go-to is Kdenlive, but it has been failing me with well-known problems of it inserting audio crackling and random pops that don't exist in the source files. Learning Blender video editing didn't actually take too long and it's pretty good overall, just some quirks you need to learn compared to other editors.</p>

      <title>Google plans their own version of Wine to run Windows games on Stadia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stadia is something we don't really talk about here too much now, as Google has let it slide considerably from the original aim but it's still going and it seems Google still has some interesting plans for it.</p>
<p>There's an upcoming <a href="https://gamedevsummit.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Google For Games Dev Summit</a> on March 15, which includes Android and Stadia. For the Stadia service that runs on Debian Linux, Google has a few talks including "Play Testing Made Easy on Stadia", "Stadia Adventures in slow server code on Unity" and "Profiling on Stadia" but the perhaps bigger one is titled "How to write a Windows emulator for Linux from scratch?" that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detailed overview of the technology behind Google's solution for running unmodified Windows games on Stadia. This is a deep technical walkthrough of some of the core concepts with the goal to allow curious programmers to better understand such technologies and potentially to build their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't know yet if it will be open source but the bigger question perhaps is why they didn't go with all the existing code that has already proven itself? We are of course talking about Wine / Proton, DXVK and VKD3D-Proton which powers Windows games on Linux desktop and the Steam Deck. It's already shown to have great performance.</p>
<p>It's an obvious move for Stadia though to help increase the game library, the same reason Valve created Proton from Wine to bring more games to Linux systems. We'll be taking a look over the talk on March 15 and will make some notes for you.</p>

      <title>Mesa drivers version 22.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More open source goodness coming at you, as Mesa version 22.0 is officially out now for Linux open source graphics drivers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-announce/2022-March/000665.html" target="_blank">release announcement</a> was short and sweet, noting Vulkan 1.3 support as one of the big features. The <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/22.0.0.html" target="_blank">release notes</a> do give a little more info, although they're still aimed at quite a technical audience. New features noted include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>lavapipe, radv, anv KHR_dynamic_rendering</li>
<li>radv EXT_image_view_min_lod</li>
<li>VK_KHR_synchronization2 on RADV.</li>
<li>OpenSWR has been moved to the Amber branch</li>
<li>radeonsi, zink ARB_sparse_texture</li>
<li>d3d12 GLES3.1 (shader storage buffers, images, compute, indirect draw, draw params, ARB_framebuffer_no_attachments, ARB_sample_shading, and GLSL400)</li>
<li>radeonsi, zink ARB_sparse_texture2</li>
<li>zink EXT_memory_object, EXT_memory_object_fd, EXT_semaphore, EXT_semaphore_fd</li>
<li>anv VK_VALVE_mutable_descriptor_type</li>
<li>Vulkan 1.3 on RADV, Anv.</li>
<li>radeonsi, zink ARB_sparse_texture_clamp</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As per usual, the Mesa team recommend people looking for stable drivers wait for at least Mesa 22.0.1.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s already over 1,200 titles either Verified or Playable for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there are issues with the Deck Verified system, Valve continues on noting down more titles as being either Deck Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>As of publishing time there's now 1,214 going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=DeckCompatDate_DESC&amp;deck_compatibility=2%2C3&amp;os=win%2Clinux" target="_blank">Valve's own list</a>, which is a huge number for a gaming device that has only just recently released. With 660 Verified and 554 Playable. One of the biggest titles to appear recently of course was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>, the massively popular Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Remember though: not being Verified or Playable doesn't mean it won't work, it just means it hasn't been through Valve's formal certification yet.</p>
<p>For games to be fully Verified they need to hit these marks:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Input - The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.</li>
<li>Display - The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.</li>
<li>Seamlessness - The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.</li>
<li>System Support - If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are still some lingering questions I have about it, now I've been testing for multiple weeks: like how they test the performance? As I've been through multiple games that are fully Verified that drop well below 30FPS. I hope this is something they will improve as testing continues.</p>
<p>Also, today, I <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1501622109356929034" target="_blank">had a chat</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/killyourfm" target="_blank">Jason Evangelho</a> from Forbes / Linux4Everyone, <a href="https://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP" target="_blank">Nick</a> from The Linux Experiment and <a href="https://twitter.com/gardiner_bryant" target="_blank">Gardiner Bryant</a> who have all also been reviewing the Steam Deck. Expect some videos and audio over the next few weeks from our chat on the Steam Deck, Valve, Linux and plenty more.</p>

      <title>Steam had a massive year in 2021 with 132 million monthly players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With competition everywhere, Valve still manages to keep on growing at a rapid pace with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3133946090937137590" target="_blank">new yearly review up</a>. Going over what happen through 2021 and a little of 2022, it's clear that Valve are doing well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam’s ongoing success is ultimately driven by two factors: the games available to players, and the quality of experience players can have with those games. In general, we direct our energy towards two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure PC games can quickly and easily ship on Steam, minimizing friction and maximizing developer control.</li>
<li>Provide games with a rich, ever-improving ecosystem of tools and features so that Steam is the best place for customers to own and play the game.</li>
</ul>
<cite>Valve</cite></blockquote>
<p>Releasing some status, Steam now has 132 million monthly active users which (on our updated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>) puts the monthly Linux active user count around 1,346,400 and daily active Linux users around 703,800.</p>

<p>It's not just the number of people using Steam that has grown, it's also the amount of hours played with Valve saying there were "almost 38 billion hours on Steam in 2021 - a 21% increase over 2020". Player spending rose a lot too by 27% compared with 2020 and that's also with 2.6 million first-time purchases during "each month of 2021".</p>
<p>Steam also delivered "nearly 33 exabytes of content to customers in 2021, a 30% increase on top of the already substantial growth of 2020" — some absolutely insane numbers there.</p>
<p>The rest of it is an overview of all the things previously announced and released, of which they did a lot.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper is a great blending of Minecraft, Terraria and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Possibly one of the best starts for a game I've seen in Early Access for some time, Core Keeper seems like an absolute delight so far. <u>Note</u>: personal purchase.</p>
<p>"Drawn towards a mysterious relic, you are an explorer who awakens in an ancient cavern of creatures, resources and trinkets. Trapped deep underground will your survival skills be up to the task?</p>
<p>Mine relics and resources to build your base, craft new equipment, survive, and power up the Core. Defeat giant monsters, discover hidden secrets, farm crops, cook new recipes and explore a procedurally generated underground world in a mining sandbox adventure for 1-8 players."</p>
<p>It feels like a great blending of Minecraft and Terraria with a view more like Stardew Valley and that's probably the easiest way to describe what to expect from it overall.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BIYcsYVxzPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ea0bcd27bddb6575af1ec256495fd2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BIYcsYVxzPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those planning to play on Steam Deck, just note that the Deck's built-in Vsync tool does not work with it. You need to use the in-game Vsync. I've seen this same issue across UT99, SuperTuxKart and Teardown. Apart from that it worked great on Deck, with text inputs bringing up the keyboard correctly too. Honestly, it feels like one of those games made for the Steam Deck. Swapping from Deck to my main Linux PC was also without hassle thanks to Steam Cloud integration, where it also works beautifully.</p>
<p>Core Keeper is going to end up a favourite, I can see it now.</p>
<p>The developer said the expect to leave Early Access by the end of 2022 but they have a lot of plans, so it's entirely possible it will keep going into next year.</p>
<p>You can find Core Keeper on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Factory building sim shapez.io got mod support recently</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapezio/" target="_blank">shapez.io</a> is a game about building an ever-expanding factory, that cuts up various shapes to make other shapes. It's gloriously engrossing and time consuming and now there's modding involved too.</p>
<p>You could already easily put tons of hours into it, now maybe even more so. This is not using the Steam Workshop though, instead they're using the standalone cross-platform <a href="https://shapez.mod.io/" target="_blank">mod.io platform</a>. It does involve downloading files manually for now, with an in-game browser to come later.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_f-GPs6xZ0o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6fee0f43563bc1b91af62cac5902fe08.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_f-GPs6xZ0o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One mod that looks worth trying is <a href="https://shapez.mod.io/shapez-industries" target="_blank">Shapez Industries</a> which adds in six new shapes, multiple new buildings, a whole new research mechanic and a good bunch more. This is going to be completely terrible for my free time.</p>
<p>shapez.io has gone onto be one of the best reviewed games on Steam now too! An Overwhelmingly Positive user review score from 6,685 people puts it around number 210 of the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">top 250</a> games on Steam — a pretty amazing achievement for any game.</p>
<p>Trying it out on Steam Deck it works out of the box but it's a little but fiddly to place things down, hopefully the developer can make it work a little better in a future update but it's doable. Works just fine on desktop too.</p>

      <title>Horror-mystery novel Scarlet Hollow has Episode 3 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With 7 episodes planned in total, episode 3 for the well-reviewed Scarlet Hollow from Black Tabby Games is out now.</p>
<p>Even as someone who doesn't usually like playing through Visual Novel styled games, I can safely tell you this is one that manages to push through. It's genuinely interesting, with some pretty great writing and surprising events that will hook you right in. You can try it free too, since the first episode has no price attached. Pretty great artwork too overall.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z6EGyuIqpZ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53519a06af34be983ba18a6b1de40bd7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z6EGyuIqpZ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A heavily branching narrative where your decisions (actually) matter. The relationships you forge and the decisions you make will dramatically alter your journey.</li>
<li>Terrifying and funny. Charming characters and snappy dialogue flip to pulse-pounding dread and horror at a moment's notice.</li>
<li>Trait-based dialogue and role-playing. Scarlet Hollow's dialogue system is driven by role-playing elements that let you choose who you want to be. Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless? Can you talk to animals? 21 different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds.</li>
<li>A dynamic relationship system that reacts to your every choice and changes how your story unfolds. People won't just like or dislike you. Become friendly rivals, bitter adversaries, best friends, or mild acquaintances with everyone in town based on how you approach the story.</li>
<li>No jumpscares. All of the horror in Scarlet Hollow comes from building tension and dread (and some disturbing imagery).</li>
<li>Original monster designs inspired by Appalachian myths and cryptids. You won't find any predictable vampires or zombies here.</li>
<li>Touching romance. Whether you're into goths, dads, paranormal investigators, mysterious recluses, or lo-fi beats to study and water your plants to, we've got all your bases covered.</li>
<li>Hundreds of meticulously hand-drawn and traditionally inked backgrounds. Every background in the game is drawn by hand and inked on massive 19x24 inch paper.</li>
<li>Countless immersive sprites. Each major character has dozens—and often hundreds—of hand-drawn sprites that interact with backgrounds and capture a full range of lighting, emotion, environment, and outfit changes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck software updated with lots of controller configuration fixes </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue working quickly to fix up issues that are flowing in against the Steam Deck software, with a new update out now and ready to download onto your Deck.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3131696199119390708" target="_blank">what's new and fixed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue causing the first notification toast displayed after boot to render incorrectly</li>
<li>Updated game status to be more accurate when local files haven't been synchronized with the Cloud files yet</li>
<li>The screenshot management link from an app details page will now take you to the media page filtered to all screenshots for that specific app.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Controller Configurator
<ul>
<li>Fixed haptics being applied to Right Joystick movement when loading a configuration authored for a Steam Controller</li>
<li>Fixed case where Right Joystick would be set to the wrong output when loading a configuration authored for a Steam Controller</li>
<li>Fixed bug w/ Trackpad Rotation setting not sticking</li>
<li>Fixed bug where changing a setting in an action set layer could cause the config to show up blank</li>
<li>Fixed cases where the cursor visibility options in the Action Set page could end up blank</li>
<li>Fixed case where Joystick mode would be erroneously applied instead of Mouse mode when converting a Steam Controller mouse and keyboard configuration to other input types including Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed issue that caused the Steam menu to briefly display content from when it was previously visible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There should also be a firmware update upcoming, which fixes a charging issue I found with USB-C hubs. More info when I have it, waiting on Valve at the moment.</p>
<p>Here's another funny one for you: during last night's livestream on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Twitch channel</a>, one of my SD Cards would not be picked up in Gaming Mode. It worked fine in desktop mode that was shown to everyone watching, but Gaming Mode just wouldn't even show it at all. I tried pulling it out and putting it in to no avail, then, I engaged "nostalgia mode" and gave it a wipe and blew on it — <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux/clip/FrailBlazingSharkHeyGirl-3UCOs5X7_F1UKh8x?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time" target="_blank">this worked</a>!</p>

<p>The day we've all been waiting for right? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a> from Respawn and EA has now been officially Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Absolutely huge news for both Linux desktop gaming with Proton and for the Steam Deck, to have one of the biggest and easily best battle royale games now fully Verified. It's hard to properly express just how big this is — simply massive. Just on Steam it's constantly in the top 10 most played, with a peak player count today alone of 281,993 people.</p>
<p>You can see it happen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/history/?changeid=14171059" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, plus it now already shows on the Steam store directly as a Verified title and on the Steam Deck clearly too.</p>

<p>I've already been playing it for several days now, as have many others and I've shown it off plenty live on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Twitch channel</a>, which led to some <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux/clip/LovelySteamyRamenHoneyBadger-xWizyNxhMgxFlb4p?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time" target="_blank">fun moments</a>.</p>
<p>You can also see some of my early preview Steam Deck gameplay below (from before the shader cache was full, it's now really smooth):</p>

      <title>An update on installing Epic Games on Steam Deck, plus accessing the SD Card</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a short update to my previous guide on installing the Epic Games store on the Steam Deck using Proton, plus how to enable access to an SD Card.</p>
<p>My original guide was included in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">this article</a> in a <a href="https://youtu.be/UvuGAQDagWE" target="_blank">video</a>, which has gone on to see a lot of people happy with it. It's now been used across PCGamer, Gamespot, CNET and no doubt others who decided to use it. CNET even ended up making their own video, which I had to poke them to actually credit me for — so that was fun (they now have).</p>
<p>There's better ways to do it, including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heroic-games-launcher-now-works-nicely-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">using the Heroic Games Launcher</a> but for those who wish to continue this method, here's an update on fixing it when it dies and to access the SD Card:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UiUvAOatu9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ed47e248e9dcb5c9db935a90f327013.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UiUvAOatu9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide notes:</p>
<p>The initial install using this method gives us a Win32 folder where the Epic Games launcher file resides. After an EGS update, there's now a Win64 folder. You need to edit your shortcut in Steam to point to Win64 instead by just editing the text on both lines, and that will fix it not opening.</p>
<p>As for the SD Card, that cannot be access by default with this method as Proton runs inside a container. However, you can tell it to allow it by adding this as a launch option in the right click -&gt; Properties section of the shortcut:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">STEAM_COMPAT_MOUNTS=/your/sd/card/address/ %command%</code></p>
<p>You can find the correct address using the Dolphin file manager, scrolling down to the Removable Devices and opening Primary. Near the top of the window where it lists the folder name, click next to it and the address will appear for you to copy. For example mine is "/run/media/mmcblk0p1/", which might be the same across most Decks.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow GamingOnLinux on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, plus <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Twitch</a> where I'm doing regular direct-capture livestreams from the Steam Deck with a capture card.</p>

      <title>Fan game Sonic Robo Blast 2 gets a new tutorial, various improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a Sonic fan and love checking out fan games? What about a 3D game made with the Doom Legacy port of Doom? <a href="https://www.srb2.org/" target="_blank">Sonic Robo Blast 2</a> is a quality addition to the collection that's quite unique. It's not just another 2D platformer like the classics, instead attempts to be a full 3D recreation.</p>
<p>You control movement with WASD and spacebar to jump, with camera being moved with either mouse or arrows. It's genuinely good and available free. As someone who grew up with Sonic, I appreciate this. Hopefully you will enjoy it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12822019531646759651gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12822019531646759651gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new in version 2.2.10:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The file limit has been massively increased. (The skin limit is still 32, though!)</li>
<li>The tutorial has been redone for the new default controls.</li>
<li>Many new additions to Lua, including bot features, an improved input library, easing functions and more.</li>
<li>Blending modes for midtextures and FOFs.</li>
<li>Multi-tagging and more convenient slope copying for non-UDMF maps.</li>
<li>Generalized slopes for UDMF maps.</li>
<li>The ability to load folders for easier addon development. No need to compile your resources into a PK3 until you’re ready to release your work!</li>
<li>A couple of updated graphics, textures &amp; sprites.</li>
<li><em>Way</em> too many bug fixes to list here.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Budgie 10.6 is out now and looking fresh</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux desktop <a href="https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.6" target="_blank">Budgie 10.6</a> is out now, as the first release under the new Buddies Of Budgie organization and it's really looking good. This release brings a bunch of styling changes, as the team has been focusing a lot on the little things to make the experience smoother.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16848450531646754669gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16848450531646754669gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Budgie 10.6 is not just a reflection of our organization change for the development of Budgie, it reflects an expansion on Budgie 10.x series with new features and re-architectures, applying the lessons learned from those into our next generation version of Budgie. Buddies of Budgie views Budgie Desktop as a platform rather than a product. Distributors of Budgie Desktop and users should not feel like their choice of theming, applications, or default styles should be at odds with the goals of the project.</p>
<p>Budgie 10.6 aims to eliminate the divide between traditional "downstream" consumers of Budgie and the development organization itself, enabling those downstreams like Ubuntu Budgie to get more intimately involved in its development.</p>
<p>Applying one of our core pillars of being a platform rather than a product, the goal with Budgie 10.6 and future releases of Budgie is to provide a macrocosm, or a minimal set of tightly coupled components, and leave the rest of the ecosystem up to the decisions and values of downstream consumers, be that distributions or end users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the release highlights includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application grouping in the Icon Tasklist on the bottom bar</li>
<li>Theme improvements</li>
<li>Notification System Rewrite</li>
<li>Elimination of some legacy queue_layout calls in the window manager, which should reduce unnecessary redraws</li>
<li>Use of tabs instead of spaces, general reformatting of some code</li>
<li>Reintroduce support for GNOME 40, to enable Ubuntu LTS support</li>
<li>Moved from Weblate to Transifex for translations</li>
<li>Renamed Budgie Desktop View schema to support its rebrand</li>
<li>Renamed GNOME Control Center references to Budgie Control Center</li>
<li>Ensure gschema override for switch-input-source* is formatted correctly, which fixes a gschema compilation warning.</li>
<li>Fix SEGV when input source was switched by Alt+Shift_L, caused by using a non-ibus input method.</li>
<li>Fixes to expanding Raven thumbnail causing Raven itself to resize</li>
</ul>
<p>You can support development on their <a href="https://opencollective.com/buddies-of-budgie" target="_blank">Open Collective</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets closer to a Flathub release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>If people want to run the app directly on a Steam Deck in the Game Mode / Deck UI though, one other addition is needed. After testing various launchers and games that use extra screens, Gamescope that handles the display of windows gets confused and madly flicks between them. It was a problem for the PolyMC launcher for Minecraft (<a href="https://youtu.be/6E2Enr5S78k" target="_blank">tutorial video</a>) that needs a setting ticked to close the launcher, and it was also a problem for the SMAPI modding client for Stardew Valley (<a href="https://youtu.be/CrrWtqdbvC4" target="_blank">tutorial video</a>) that needs a config file change to hide it.</p>
<p>After speaking to the Heroic developer today, they're going to look into a setting to have the launcher get out of the way when you run a game. So hopefully the Steam Deck experience will be great.</p>

      <title>Linux sticks above 1% still on the Steam Hardware Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a few days delay, the Steam Hardware Survey has now been updated with the latest numbers and Linux is still just about holding above 1%.</p>
<p>It has seen another small drop though of 0.04% so the Linux user share is now at 1.02%. As you can see on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6605716191646739502gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6605716191646739502gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As a reminder, this survey is opt-in and currently it isn't clear how the Steam Deck that uses SteamOS 3 Linux will affect it. Valve couldn't give a clear answer when asked about it during <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">my original review</a>. I was told it would show up as Linux, but when asked if it would show the survey in Gaming Mode / Deck UI, it didn't sound like it would yet as it's not a priority to add it in. Which is fair, Valve have a huge amount they need to get fix up right now with various bugs and quirks.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 15: Square Cubed</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-14-return-to-na-pali/" target="_blank">Part 14: Return to Na Pali</a></strong></p>
<p>John Carmack's generosity in releasing his older source code resulted in a proliferation of free first person shooters in the 2000s with almost all of them based on some variation of the <em>Quake</em> engine. This proved to be a boon to Linux gamers, but Dutch programmer Wouter van Oortmerssen rejected this path to forge <em>Cube</em> based in the same "just for fun" spirit with which Linus Torvalds first began work on the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Unlike Torvalds though<em> Cube</em> was helped by Oortmerssen's deliberate rejection of the open source model, which often clashes with the auteur nature of independent game development. The source code is available under the zlib License for anyone to modify, but the distributed game itself is his own curated creation, with his singular vision proving to be what happens when you mix <em>Doom</em>, <em>Quake</em>, and <em>Serious Sam</em> in a blender.</p>
<p>In the end I had to use the oldest binaries still available from SourceForge, those contained in the cube_2002_10_20.zip archive, as every later packaged version of the game was built against libstdc++5 which is too new for my Red Hat Linux 7.3 installation. This places me in the curious position of being on the opposite end of the glibc 2.3 compatibility problem, as this is the main library which causes issues when running certain Loki Software games on newer systems.</p>
<p>I did try building the final <em>Cube</em> source code myself on Dianoga, but was not able to provide the ENet development libraries that <em>Cube</em> requires. The last released binaries do still run on my modern Arch Linux computer, although I had to modify the launch script or it would complain "Your processor does not have a supported Cube client" upon discovering I was starting the game under x86_64. Overriding the check resolved this, but it still suffers from a video memory leak.</p>
<p>While <em>Cube</em> never became the slickest game, this early version from 2002 is even rougher around the edges. I actually found the game easier to play after familiarizing myself more with the final release and then going back, as the monsters in their earlier incarnations do not telegraph their attacks as much and simply transform into meaty chunks when killed, not giving me as much feedback to aid in developing viable counters.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17486903391646348822gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17486903391646348822gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6762443161646348288gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6762443161646348288gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Single player consists of two modes, "SP" which plays like a standard first person shooter campaign where you progress through levels unlocking areas until all the monsters are killed, and "DMSP" which takes the form of a horde mode but with there still being a finite number of enemies to eliminate on a map. These work, but it is way too easy to end up with just one or two monsters left on a level, forcing you to scour the entire map again in search of them.</p>
<p>Limitations like this make "DMSP" more enjoyable than the "SP" mode, as the tighter formula of stock up, hold your ground, then hunt down the stragglers, rinse and repeat, plays more to the game's strengths with the chaotic gunplay and monster infighting. More remarkable than <em>Cube</em> itself is the engine that powers it, due to its advanced in-game level editing abilities but also the engine's conspicuous simplicity.</p>
<p>Levels are actually displayed using a 2D height map similar to that of the original <em>Doom</em>, having most of the same restraints such as no rooms over other rooms, but with <em>Cube</em> also supporting slopes and 3D modeled polygonal assets. The result is a delightful blend of both the old and the new, which along with all the map data being interpreted on the fly makes for an easy yet powerful creative tool for constructing levels or even entire new games.</p>
<p>The performance of the <em>Cube</em> engine was also quite acceptable, feeling fluid for me except for in the most intense situations even when using default settings. There were some graphical glitches, mostly along the seams of walls, floors, skyboxes, as well as the edges of water, and there were a few broken transparencies with projectile sprites. Overbright lighting also gets disabled, which is odd as the game documentation states that my video card should support it.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the engine resulted in a number of forks, the most notable being<em> AssaultCube</em>, a standalone tactical spin off which still sees active development. There is also the sequel <em>Cube 2</em>: <em>Sauerbraten</em>, which brings the same editing features of <em>Cube</em> to a full 3D game engine, and was last updated in 2020. Having put my Rage 128 Pro through its paces running three different OpenGL game engines on Linux, let us now try to exercise my Sound Blaster 16 instead.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm flibit. I work on a lot of games... and I mean a LOT:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Ports" target="_blank">Over 70 PC and console ports shipped in 10 years as a one-man team</a></li>
<li>Active maintainer of over 150 SKUs across said 70 titles (as in I still update them today)</li>
<li>Lead developer of a <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">middleware with 9 platforms actively supported, including consoles, with more on the way</a></li>
<li>Lead developer of <a href="https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FAudio" target="_blank">FAudio</a>, which is why Proton has working audio for a huge percentage of the catalog</li>
<li>Co-maintainer of Linux/Switch/Xbox/Stadia versions of <a href="https://libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a>, which has WAY more platforms that all have to be able to pass cert at any moment (you might recognize me from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/sdl-2022-will-default-to-wayland-on-linux/" target="_blank">Wayland work in SDL</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
In short: I'm responsible for making sure that new versions of games are performant and reliable, and this means passing many of these versions through certification programs. A new Steam Machine directly from Valve was an exciting prospect, but it hasn't come without its problems. Today we're going to talk about just one of them:</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I've been infamously critical of the Steam Deck from day one. From just about every angle imaginable you could be forgiven for thinking I entirely disagree with the way the Deck's software has been developed, advertised, presented to developers, and so on. I could go on for quite a while about all of these things.</p>
<p>Much of it is about the software and there are a number of reasons why, the main two being:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software side of things is where I'm most comfortable giving my opinions</li>
<li>A lot about the Deck is genuinely good from a software guy's perspective (the hardware is great, the price makes sense, and with people so desperate for new hardware I get why they were so eager to get it out the door at any and all costs)</li>
</ol>
<p><br/>
However, another reason is that we as developers didn't have a great look at how our software would interact with the Deck ecosystem until the device was pretty much already out. Because of this, it wasn't a huge surprise to see that there were <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-verified-and-playable-hit-a-thousand-games/" target="_blank">issues regarding the Deck Verified program</a>, across many different kinds of titles on Steam.</p>
<p>While not surprising, it is still disappointing - with the Deck becoming so influential so quickly, this has had a profoundly negative impact on some developers, particularly small developers, who in many cases put in exceptional amounts of work to prepare for the inevitable second generation of Steam Machines, only to be slapped in the face at the 11th hour with a number of results that anyone with a cursory knowledge of the game would know is invalid, including but not limited to native games that are inexplicably labelled as Proton-by-default, or native games that are marked completely unsupported because they only tested Windows binaries without even bothering to try the native ones, and a whole mess of things in between depending on what the cert process was like that day. This has caused problems at the other end of the spectrum as well, with reviewers regularly running into popular AAA games that were mysteriously labelled as Verified when they didn't actually work in reality. This might sound really harsh, but there's something important to consider here:</p>
<p>While not <em>intentionally</em> malicious, it's a good example of how one centralized superpower's decision making can affect an entire industry, whether they were part of the intended equation or not. You might recognize this narrative from the release of the original Windows Store! Given that WinRT and Windows Store were the catalysts for basically everything you're seeing on this website today this is not the comparison we want to be making, so how do we correct this?</p>
<p>Before we dive in we must address a possible conflict of interest, so let me make one thing absolutely clear: I do not in any way expect my titles to be given priority just because they're native, but I <em>fully</em> expect my work to be given the chance it deserves, and any organization that intends to insert itself between myself and the customers should expect to put in as much care into the product as the authors have. Similar to games in general, a select few AAA titles does not speak for an entire library. I and many other developers are doing our best to create an out-of-the-box catalog that directly targets the Deck platform and operating system with as few layers as possible to produce performant, energy-efficient software whose design is not dictated by a totally unrelated megacorporation, which is allegedly the long-term plan for this in the first place.</p>
<p>Developers, and independent developers in particular, are just as interested in expanding the PC beyond Windows as Valve is, and as early investors (some investing a decade or more in advance!) the Steam Deck's launch has not met our expectations. It is in everyone's interest to avoid another Windows 8 situation, and that means trying to fix this quickly and effectively for <em>all</em> developers, not just the highest-profile titles. Since launch was *checks notes* less than a month ago, there's still a chance to make this work! Even better, despite all the issues, Valve have continued to develop the platform in a largely transparent way, at least after the hardware launched: In addition to having their developer documentation be available to the public, they've also continued publishing source code for the Deck specifically, including the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-open-sources-steamos-devkit-client-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">recent release of the devkit tools</a>. This was a significant factor in choosing to make this critique public; Steam Deck is a rare opportunity for developers to be transparent about how these processes work with end users. In addition to building a positive relationship with customers in a way that can't be replicated outside of the PC, we can also make end users far more informed of the reality of game development on Steam, and the Steam Deck in particular. Informed customers are happy customers, even if the information isn't always pleasant.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let's dig into the Deck Verified program, how it relates to traditional certification programs, and what can be done to clean things up and get everyone back on the same page. If you want a good starting point as an end user, Valve's documentation for this is public and <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/compat" target="_blank">you should definitely read it</a>.</p>
<h3>What is Console Certification?</h3>
<p>For those unaware, console certification (known usually as "cert", sometimes other names like "lotcheck") is when you submit a (hopefully) final build to the console vendor so that they can run a series of <em>extremely</em> strict checks to make sure your game is stable and has a fully working user experience. With devices getting more sophisticated and operating systems getting simpler for developers this has gotten slightly easier, but by no means is it easy <em>period</em>: Ask any Nintendo licensee what it's like to make controller support fully robust and you'll most likely get a look of utter defeat and bottomless trauma. Look to the Nintendo <em>catalog</em>, however, and you'll see why these procedures are in place.</p>
<p>Going through cert is a lot like paying your taxes. You know you have to do it, nobody really likes doing it, we can complain about how it might get convoluted at times, but at the end of the day it's an essential part of what makes everything work even if it doesn't feel like it half the time. And you sure as hell would not want the review process for this paperwork to be rushed and later revealed to be part of some temporary experiment. Oh, and before anyone makes the joke, <a href="https://bethesdagamestudios.com/" target="_blank">yes rich people casually bypass it constantly</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the games business likes everything to be fast, and I mean <em>fast</em>. Customers, investors, and industry insiders alike are often guilty of (perhaps unknowingly) pressuring studios to get the product out now and then finish it later. Cert happens to be the exact one thing that people acknowledge is a big pile of red tape and bureaucracy, and it is a tremendous waste to not capitalize on this! You literally have full carte blanche to take your time and be very thoughtful and meticulous about how you want things to work, and it is extremely important that you take advantage of this.</p>
<p>There had to have been a lot of pressure to showcase big games working out of the box, but there's a big difference between a recommended showcase and building a trustworthy bureaucratic process that people can rely on in the long term. Mix these two up and you're just building up a huge amount of debt that, if not paid back very quickly, will leave players and developers wondering why you even have a cert process at all, which is an attitude that's anything but trivial to turn around. It's hard to build a reliable Trust System(TM), but it's much harder to build one right after making a system that turned out not to be trustworthy. Correcting this quickly will be really important as the rest of the platform begins to stabilize and more people have a Deck in their hands (author's note: there is absolutely no way I'm not wording it like this for all eternity).</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of platforms and a lot of cert submissions from various companies, including the oldest in the industry to companies who only became a major platform within the last few years. Some vendors do things better, some do things worse, but they all have a lot of in common and in general these would be great things to copy for your own program:</p>
<h3>0: Each SKU gets its own review</h3>
<p>Look, I know it seems obnoxious for me to have this in the article, but when you are testing two different SKUs, each one should be tested separately. When you look at how things are executed now, you could be forgiven for alleging that Valve tried to get by with Wine-only, only to fail horribly and get caught immediately, but regardless of the real story we can at least be sure that native is part of the process <em>today</em>, which is great!</p>
<p>Problem is, from what I and other developers have observed, the results are still just a mishmash with no sort of clarity as to what notes are for what build. Specific devs working on a game might know that the Windows build has patented codecs in it while native does not, but a manager looking at these results probably won't know what this means. Two tables for two SKUs is not a huge ask, especially if you aren't going to let developers tell you what you should test and deploy. (As an aside: People who phoned in their Linux versions will choose Proton from a drop-down themselves, saving you a lot of time coming up with wacky schemes to try and autodetect... even those who did a pretty good job will <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/feral-interactive-have-no-plans-to-update-their-linux-ports-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">still do this work for you</a>, so if there's not going to be any effort to improve the native versions at all, why not let them make that choice directly?)</p>
<h3>1. Actual notes with test results</h3>
<p>Currently when you get test results, you get a series of items with PASS/FAIL on them, with some automated text when there's a FAIL. This is <em>very</em> typical for cert processes, however the automated text is not helpful at all, and that's assuming there are any notes to begin with. To emphasize my point, I can even disclose a private test result because there's nothing private about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test failed due to the title not providing external gamepad support for the primary player. We highly encourage providing support for externally connected gamepad to offer the player with the option of playing using the gamepad of their choice. Partial controller support is available but the following actions are not available via the default controller configuration: [Space, Escape]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can even see where the autogenerated part starts and ends! In this entire paragraph, the game-specific notes are two words long. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/blob/master/issue_template.md" target="_blank">End users are held to higher standards than this</a>, so why not the cert program?</p>
<p>This is a pretty severe contrast with competitors' processes, where we get reasonably good notes including screenshots, diagnostic information, and sometimes even video! This information is not difficult to produce if you're a human testing a game, especially if these are things you can get from the OS out of the box. (So okay, maybe video is out of range for Steam right now... having played on an Xbox recently I would love for this to change though.)</p>
<p>With good enough notes, you would also be able to find common patterns and make the official test suite more robust, and eventually build an entire conformance test suite for developers to reference before they've even submitted. Relying solely on the existing framework is a one-way ticket to stagnation, which is the opposite of what anyone wants for their product.</p>
<p>This isn't just about being thorough, it's also about clarifying things that can be interpreted in many ways: When a bunch of native games started to get labeled as Proton titles, you can imagine the panic at my office when I had to explain to my own clients that "yes I actually tested on real hardware, yes the Linux version is optimal, no I don't know why Valve is blocking my build, no you should not delete the port" over and over again basically since all results became public. It would have been nice if the experimental test data had been marked as such, even a "this is temporary, we plan to migrate verified titles to native closer to release" would have saved me a lot of trouble and, to put it bluntly, a whole lot of money I'll never see again. Those opportunities and resources could have been used to make more games, and sadly some of these effects are likely irreversible. Preventing these outcomes is important for the future of the platform.</p>
<p>Finally, making the notes public would be useful as well - while some of the technical notes might include things like NDA'd symbols in a stack trace, in all my years of doing console builds I have never at any point run into high-level notes that were sensitive or required to be private, with the exception of spoilers which are trivial to mask (as Steam already does elsewhere). If a game is only unsupported because of codecs, for example, that is useful information for everyone!</p>
<h3>2: Running cert behind our backs is the last option, not the first</h3>
<p>Again, I get it, Steam's strength is in its back catalog (I even gave a whole presentation at MAGFest about this), but even the older games that are popular still have someone keeping an eye on them, so it should be no problem to let them submit to cert themselves. This one is hard to compare to other vendors because they aren't releasing games before they get certified, but a big part of the cert process is communication between the console vendor and the app vendor. This back-and-forth process is essential in getting good data, for a number of reasons including but not remotely limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>App vendors can get clarification on strange test results</li>
<li>Console vendors can get clarification on unusual (but not broken) program behavior</li>
<li>In rare instances, a developer can file a waiver stating that a cert rule may not be strictly relevant (for example, if the control scheme is deliberately unusual and has clear disclaimers on the store page)</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's basic, basic stuff. The one that I know Valve cares about:</p>
<ul>
<li>App vendors can provide feedback on the certification program</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
You have this entirely new platform, with a slightly stricter ruleset than your existing one, and the data set is unspeakably huge with variety that no program in the world is going to be able to automate. You're on record, multiple times, across multiple decades, as saying that human feedback matters a huge deal, and these statements were recorded during a time when everything seems to be getting automated (whether it even makes sense or not). You have a very large subset of games with active developers, who actively target roughly the same platform (natively even!) and would be very proactive if given the chance to be a part of the program, from submitting builds to providing feedback on your program before it's even out. Some of them even had the hardware over half a year before it was available to the public.</p>
<p>Why, <em>why</em>, <strong><em>why</em></strong> was the answer to withhold the submission process to this very day and secretly shotgun blast the catalog with experimental procedures a month before launch? I'm sorry to be so harsh here, but the results have been horrific: It completely ignores the human element of cert (arguably the best part), blocks proactive developers from contributing to the platform, annoys people who are actively watching random, clearly abandoned games get pushed to the front of the queue, and wastes the effort of people who had the working program in their hands from the start and, to put it bluntly again, deserved the spotlight at launch a whole lot more. As a reminder, this isn't about me, there's a whole group of early investors who feel cheated by the current system and these will likely be the experts you will need to have readily available for the alleged long-term plans.</p>
<p>Looking at the cert results, the dates of the tests, and the runtimes being used, I can only assume the timing had something to do with the release of Wine 7, which would be fine for Windows games but completely ignores the breadth of native games that could have been a part of early cert prototypes. I can only hope I'm wrong here, but I can't help but look at the timeline and wonder why people had the hardware for all that time when the paperwork came so late.</p>
<p>Right now a lot of discussion is about the OS and bugs, but my guess is when people call the Deck "rushed" years from now this is what they will be talking about. Sure, the OS bugs are rampant, but they will probably be fixed eventually. As of now I'm not as confident about the cert results and I'm not alone here.</p>
<h3>3: Cert results should not be silent and on an unspecified timer</h3>
<p>The Deck Verified program's results have the potential to be hugely influential in customers' purchasing decisions, whether they have the hardware or not. The data that comes out of this should be given a lot of care, and more importantly a lot of attention from everyone involved in maintaining the game.</p>
<p>Out of the five products that have been given ratings on Steam that I have partner access for, I have received a single notification for one of them. Developers with less than 70 games under their belt have similar ratios as far as I can tell. (So yes, for the past couple weeks I have had to go game-by-game to manually search for test results for dozens of games, just in case results were sent without a notification. No, the recent per-organization view didn't help, because I'm also in dozens of separate organizations.)</p>
<p>This would be less of a problem if 100% of the testing I'm able to see wasn't being done in secrecy - I have dozens of titles I could submit and actively wait for results on, but I'm also not sure if I'd even get the notes back in time. If you want something to shotgun-blast, this is the place to do it. Send the message to everyone in the organization, and be explicit about who the data is for. I'll even write the multiplat one for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These test results were based on both your Linux and Windows versions. We strongly recommend forwarding this information to the appropriate engineers <u><em><strong>immediately</strong></em></u> so that the appropriate changes can be made. The sooner the results are verified by your team, the sooner they can be published!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Send that every 12 hours to every account in the org until you get a response or the results are published, then you'll have a legitimate reason for the timer. To get back to the taxes comparison: It sounds obnoxious, but having constant reminders for something this important is trivial to justify, no matter how much you might hate it at the time.</p>
<p>This would mitigate the other problem which is that nobody seems to know how long we actually have until the results get published. Is it a week? Two weeks? Are we even supposed to know about it in advance? When I ask around, the answer is always different, and the docs aren't much help with "approximately a week" as the official timeline. Until looking it up for this post I honestly thought it was twice as long for manually submitted results (and for secret results it seems to just be zero), because in my experience a cert back-and-forth being a week is unrealistic even for the biggest console vendors who have invested far more in this area.</p>
<p>For end users that might see "a week" and think that's a lot, it actually is even less time than I'm making it out to be, because the timer doesn't stop if a back-and-forth starts! That's right, if you get marked "unsupported" and the timer hits zero before you've had a chance to figure out the problem, up on the store page it goes, regardless of the test result's accuracy. This is a direct contradiction to the same sentence that says how long this process is (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you take no action</strong>, after approximately a week your review results will automatically be published and show up on your game detail page as the "results of Valve's testing" (see Steam Store on Deck section above).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't without reason, it's just not the <em>best</em> reason: From what I can tell, "action" is defined as one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resubmitting to cert</li>
<li>Publishing the results</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
You can optionally file a ticket to get clarification on the results, but this appears to be completely disconnected from the process itself (in fact, it's just using the end user support system, not a direct contact form, so there's no guarantee the person you get in touch with has anything to do with your test results). I filed tickets for two titles and, after getting no response, I bit the bullet and put both games back on the queue with zero notes to work from. This is a massive waste of everyone's time: As a developer I have no idea if I did anything wrong and therefore can't spend my time making the game better, and Valve now has to go through the entire process for literally the same build only because I'm crossing my fingers and hoping the cert process is nicer to me this time. For a catalog as big as Steam's (or even mine, honestly), this time adds up <em>very</em> quickly!</p>
<p>If you want to point to exactly one scenario where taking advantage of "the bureaucracy" would prevent a whole lot of headaches, this is the one to cite. I know putting hard deadlines on anything sucks, but because cert is the inverse of the rest of the industry the solution is surprisingly simple: Just pick a stupidly huge number that's impossible to object to. Forget "approximately a week", make it 30 days from the timestamp of the first e-mail and then permanently kill all timers the moment you get a response of any kind. Nobody in their right mind is going to ignore 60 copies of the same e-mail, particularly for something that actually matters, unless they're long gone. At that point you have a pretty solid excuse to publish behind their back.</p>
<p>Lastly, having direct contact with the cert tester is really important because they will understand the notes better than anyone else, and it avoids getting lost in the monolithic beast that is public Steam support.</p>
<h3>4. Probably more?</h3>
<p>The Steam Deck is very new which means it's extremely volatile, whether it be the technical details or the boring, bureaucratic stuff. Looking at its current state, the team involved is probably going to be in crunch for pretty much the rest of the year, which is awful to think about. While I can't act like I can make decisions for anyone but myself, I would like to suggest that if there's one thing they should slow down on, it's the Deck Verified program. To carry out even a subset of changes that I've suggested will take a <em>lot</em> of work, but if Crunch Mode continues unchecked, that delta between what's in production -&gt; what needs to be in place is going to get bigger, which means it's going to be more work and therefore be harder to pull off. I would very happily accept a delay in getting my catalog certified if the results are something that my customers can trust without having to sift through user reviews and databases like ProtonDB, all of which are far more likely to have errors or omissions in their entries. Not that they do this on purpose or anything, it's just the difference between end users and trained QA.</p>
<p>Even an "open" platform like Steam deserves to have the latter, and I will continue to do my best to support a program that demonstrates great care in its quality assurance, because it's absolutely possible to have such a service available to PC gamers and nothing would be more satisfying than having GNU/Linux be at the center of it.</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt got upgraded, here&#39;s how to use it on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> is a very helpful application that can help you install extra compatibility layers on Linux and Steam Deck. It just had small new release, so it's time to take a better look. New in version 2.6.0 are translations for: german, finnish and spanish plus there's a new game list dialog.</p>
<p>It enables you at a few button clicks to download and automatically install GE-Proton (previously called Proton-GE), Luxtorpeda, Boxtron or Roberta for Steam. On top of that you can do Wine-GE, Lutris-Wine or Kron4ek's Vanilla Wine-Builds for Lutris. Need more? It will also handle installing Wine-GE or GE-Proton for the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>Why might you want to use it? Valve's Proton can have problems with certain games, while community-built tools like <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> have extra fixes that can help but they have less testing and do things at times legally Valve can't do and so Valve use other methods that will eventually get them working in full. As just one example. Here's a look at how to use it on the Steam Deck, which is the same on a Linux desktop:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6doaQNnHR60"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37b4fc871ab3188f385a1c60a2e0949c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li>Load the application.</li>
<li>Pick what you want to install, in this example it was Proton-GE.</li>
<li>In Steam:
	<ul>
<li>Linux desktop: right click and go to Properties.</li>
<li>Steam Deck: find the game in your library, go to the little COG on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select it from the drop-down</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun fact: during this testing I downloaded Persona 4 Golden just for it. Whole download done, and I launched the game with Proton 7 to see no videos. Then I quit, and Steam then decided to do an extra 1.67GB download. So I reloaded, and suddenly it had videos — but with the no sound issue. Valve absolutely need to improve that flow, as it should be giving Steam Deck and Linux players those needed files as soon as it detects you go to download it. I hope they improve that in the future.</p>

      <title>Albion Online now testing gamepad support and ready for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you need another MMO fix in your life, Albion Online is pretty good and has a lot of players. It's available as a direct <a href="https://albiononline.com/en/home" target="_blank">standalone</a> download and on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Looks like it might end up quite good on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Coming along with their latest patch that also started Season 15 plenty of other tweaks were done including automatic silver pickup, tweaks to randomized dungeons, combat balance changes and <a href="https://albiononline.com/en/changelog/lands-awakened-patch-6" target="_blank">various other</a> adjustments. The big one is of course the new gamepad support, which isn't quite finished yet.</p>
<p>On a Steam Deck it's <em>automatic</em>, but for the standalone and desktop PCs you need to enter a chat command of "#controller on" or "#controller off" to hook it up for now. More info in <a href="https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/161217-Controller-Support-Live-Testing/?postID=1206636#post1206636" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a test to see how it works:</p>

      <title>The itch.io app works on a Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own a lot of games on itch.io? I do, and a huge amount more from past charity bundles I've yet to go and claim so maybe the Steam Deck will help me and you get through them all.</p>
<p>Since the itch team provide a launcher app, I wanted to see how well it would work on the Steam Deck and there were a few requests to check it out. Thankfully, their native Linux build runs just fine in desktop mode. Here's a quick video look with the steps below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DuQGjUuw8_A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50e5b428aa9468051611b401b1513f85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DuQGjUuw8_A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's nicely easy to get set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to <a href="http://itch.io/app" target="_blank">itch.io/app</a> and hit the big download button.</li>
<li>Run the downloaded file from your Downloads folder.</li>
<li>Login and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the itch app itself does not like Game Mode / Deck UI. So, you will need to add the games individually, the same way you add anything to Steam. Either the Games menu up top, then add a non-steam game. Or the Add game button on the bottom left on the main Steam client window.</p>
<p>All itch games by default install into <code class="inline-code">/home/deck/.config/itch/apps/</code></p>

      <title>Silly physics co-op platformer Super Bunny Man might be worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I had honestly never heard of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/673750/Super_Bunny_Man/" target="_blank">Super Bunny Man</a> until a reader emailed it in but it seems quite popular, one of those games to have a proper laugh with a friend as you fail together.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access, a Linux version was added up on Steam back in September 2021! Somehow entirely missed here. There's a Very Positive user rating on Steam from over 2,000 people so the developer clearly has something a little bit special here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4v5aaIpPvfs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d0ee696712bcc17d3d960ef58c2ee6bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4v5aaIpPvfs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Honestly this looks like a genuinely good time. Think I might have to try it.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Story mode:</p>
<p>Play singleplayer, or get together with a friend (local or online) for some co-op mayhem! 40 challenging levels across 4 different worlds (Forest, snow, cave, beach, and more coming soon!)</p>
<p>Party Mode - Multiplayer for up to 4 players! (Online &amp; Local)</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathmatch: Kick your friends off cliffs, drag them onto spikes, break their necks! (Disclaimer: not recommended for fragile or strained friendships).</li>
<li>Basketball: Choose a team, then fight to get the ball into your hoop!</li>
<li>Carrot grab : Strap on a jet pack and collect more carrots than the other team!</li>
</ul>
<p>And more!</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller support for up to 4 players!</li>
<li>Physics-based character and world.</li>
<li>Mind-blowing 2.5D computer-generated graphical images.</li>
<li>Evocative musical soundtrack, with grooves so addictive they've been banned in dance clubs across the world.</li>
<li>Unbelievable dance moves.</li>

      <title>Starting this Summer, iFixit will offer Steam Deck replacement parts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Valve thinks you shouldn't open up your Steam Deck, and they would prefer a professional do it, they will still offer parts through iFixit.</p>
<p>The team at iFixit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/ifixit-did-a-teardown-of-the-steam-deck-official-partner-for-parts/" target="_blank">recently</a> did a video teardown, showing off things Valve suggest not to do as part of their announcement on teaming up with Valve for this. The good news is the wait won't be too long, as they told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22962087/ifixit-steam-deck-replacement-parts-summer" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that parts will become available to order "this Summer".</p>
<p>If you want to be notified of when they become available, you can <a href="https://ifixit.activehosted.com/f/62" target="_blank">sign up</a> to be notified.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think I'll be opening up my Deck to fiddle around with its insides. I plan to mostly use mine as an actual gaming device, without any hardware adjustments. Will you be opening up yours though? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>If you missed it, Valve did their own teardown and it was quite good:</p>

<p>Well well, open source continues to grow, good! Imagination Technologies will be joining up with all the rest involved in Mesa development, with their PowerVR GPUs. Developer Frank Binns put up a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/15243" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> for Mesa that was <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2022-March/225699.html" target="_blank">announced here</a> on a mailing list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm excited to share that over the last year we've been working on a new Vulkan driver, compiler and Linux kernel DRM driver for our PowerVR GPUs. As it was important for us to do things "right", we got Collabora involved early on in the project. They've been a big help and have guided us with the approach and overall design of the driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more companies look to the fantastic developers as open source consulting firm Collabora, who have done a huge amount of great work across many areas for Linux.</p>
<p>Their initial focus is on their Rogue architecture, which they said has already been tested using the Acer Chromebook R13. Curiously, they've only started with the Vulkan side and mentioned efforts to run OpenGL over Vulkan like Zink / ANGLE "We therefore felt that a Vulkan driver together with Zink/ANGLE would be a good way to support multiple APIs from the get go" — so maybe this will be one of the first drivers that perhaps won't do a full OpenGL driver and just let it be handled by something like Zink.</p>
<p>Hopefully over time we'll see more vendors go the open source route. This is the way.</p>

      <title>Dorfromantik gets controller upgrades for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1455840/Dorfromantik/" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a> is a ridiculously popular peaceful building strategy and puzzle game and now it should work <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1455840/announcements/detail/3105799413161195194" target="_blank">a little better</a> on the Steam Deck. With an Overwhelmingly Positive user score on Steam, seems it's one not to miss.</p>
<p>Along with a bunch of other improvements, the controls have been ported over to gamepads specifically for the Steam Deck. It's not quite finished, with multiple parts needing improvements but the remaining parts the developer said can be used with the touchscreen for now. They have plans to upgrade it further in future to ensure great gamepad support but that will come after the main launch "this spring".</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to transfer files from your PC to a Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to transfer files to and from your PC to a Steam Deck? It's easy and here's how you can do it in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Something I've seen asked a lot directly to me, and across numerous posts on Reddit so hopefully this will help. This way requires no extra hardware, you just need to ensure your devices are on the same network and that's all.</p>
<p>First up, a video guide and below the text guide steps.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sHdQT6kI6Q8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19a3ae17b3f5d222318c04ab975ae8a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sHdQT6kI6Q8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Warpinator (a tool by the Linux Mint team)
	<ul>
<li>Linux / Steam Deck: install Warpinator from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.x.Warpinator" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. Available in the Discover software centre for Plasma.</li>
<li>Windows: head to <a href="https://winpinator.swisz.cz/" target="_blank">this site</a> to download it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load up Warpinator on both systems, and each will list the other device.</li>
<li>Select the device to transfer onto, then select "Send files" and just pick your files.</li>
<li>On the receiving device, it will have a pop-up noting an incoming file, just hit the tick next to it in the list.</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
<p>To get some questions out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>KDE Connect does not come pre-installed, and a developer <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlKDE/status/1497864311330508800" target="_blank">told me</a> it's not going to be possible yet to put it on Flathub.</li>
<li>Yes, there's other ways to do it including sftp/ftp but this is a <em>simple</em> way anyone can follow.</li>
<li>There are browser-based solutions but they're much slower.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you're <em>not</em> afraid of the terminal and Python (you can do this on Windows too): make a folder where you want stuff to be ready to transfer, then run this command inside that folder (Python 3): <code class="inline-code">python -m http.server 5555</code> then on your Steam Deck open a browser to your host machine local IP (http://x.x.x.x:5555) and you can then see and grab files that way too. <em>Credit to x_wing and g000h in our comments.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck had an update fixing Steam Cloud conflicts, Steam Input improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck now out in the wild, there's a lot more people finding issues and so Valve are moving quickly to get as many quirks fixed as possible. A new system update rolled out late last night.</p>
<p>Here's what the March 4 system update included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam Cloud file conflict created in some cases when the game's Steam Cloud configuration has changed</li>
</ul>
Steam Input:

<ul>
<li>Added mouse as an input option for games that use the Steam Input API</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when no controller is attached</li>
<li>Updated layout of mouse bindings page in the controller configurator</li>
</ul>
General:

<ul>
<li>Now switch to the correct friends tab when opening invites via a notification</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the same system update could be installed twice</li>
<li>Added an option to disable WiFi power management under Settings-&gt;Developer. Disabling this may improve connection reliability on 5GHz networks.</li>
<li>Fixed bug when opening the developer notes on Deck Verified info panel</li>
<li>Added additional information for when the keyboard theme cannot be changed</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm currently dealing with a really confusing issue when it comes to charging my Deck, with a USB-C hub plugged in.</p>
<p>Have been chatting with Valve about it, done a number of tests and still very confused. If I or Valve manage to find what the actual problem is, I'll probably write it up. Basically: sometimes with a USB-C hub plugged in, my Deck won't charge or charges a tiny amount. However, at random, it will charge with that same USB-C hub plugged in. If it doesn't, I can unplug the hub and plug it back in a few times until the Deck suddenly decides to charge. It's very confusing and I've now seen it across two entirely different USB-C hubs (both highly rated with 100w pass-through) and two different chargers (official + more powerful 65w charger).</p>

      <title>DXVK v1.10 and VKD3D-Proton v2.6 out improving Proton for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two vital open source projects for the Steam Deck had new releases today, with the DXVK and VKD3D-Proton layers that translate Direct3D / DirectX to Vulkan.</p>
<p>With these two, Proton that runs Windows games on the Steam Deck and Linux desktops should see some nice improvements with a future release. I won't go over all the changes, as it's aimed at quite a technical audience but for us regular users here's a few highlights.</p>
<p>Some of what you can expect to see thanks to <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10" target="_blank">DXVK 1.10</a> include better performance for Assassin's Creed: Origins, Elex II, God of War, GTA IV, Quantum Break, Resident Evil 0, 5, 6, Resident Evil: Revelations 2, Total War: Warhammer III and others. There's also a few bug fixes for specific games like Arma 2 fixing texture issues and Black Mesa lighting issues.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.6" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton 2.6</a> you can expect to see a fix for a black screen rendering bug in Horizon Zero Dawn, a startup crash fix for Final Fantasy VII: Remake and Warframe, multiple crash fixes for Guardians of the Galaxy when interacting with certain game objects, Elden Ring shouldn't hang on shutdown and broken geometry rendering in Age of Empires: IV.</p>
<p>Other VKD3D-Proton improvements reduce loading times in Monster Hunter: Rise, Guardian of the Galaxy and Elden Ring. There's also a workaround for DEATHLOOP menu flicker on the AMD RADV driver, a workaround for "quirky API usage" in Elden Ring, sorts out glitching foliage in Horizon Zero Dawn and another workaround to help "some questionable UE4 shaders".</p>

      <title>Valve open sources SteamOS Devkit Client for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to develop for the Steam Deck / SteamOS and get testing? Now it's a whole lot easier, as Valve has now put up the tools needed under open source licenses.</p>
<p>There's two projects included with the SteamOS Devkit Client and the SteamOS Devkit Service, both of which are available on their <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/devkit" target="_blank">GitLab page</a>. Setting it up, at least on Linux, was pretty painless thanks to the clear instructions so even someone like me can give it a try and see what it's like.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17884472051646412394gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17884472051646412394gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With this, developers can easily upload builds from one device to a Steam Deck to easily begin testing. Available to developers anyway but now they don't have to be approved by Valve, as anyone can just grab it. It has a number of other interesting tools to control a Steam Deck remotely too, like forcing it to drop into Desktop Mode or back to Deck UI mode ("Gaming Mode").</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue putting more out in the open. This means others can test, report issues and perhaps even contribute code back to improve it further or even hack away at it to use it for other things.</p>

      <title>One Deck Dungeon gets &#39;optimized&#39; for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One Deck Dungeon developer Handelabra Games Inc. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/770100/announcements/detail/3120436560667634825" target="_blank">announced</a> recently that a new upgrade is available, which should make the experience on Steam Deck much nicer.</p>
<p>"Adventure calls... but you don't always have time to spend hours optimizing your character sheet or managing your inventory! One Deck Dungeon lets you jump right in to bashing down doors, rolling dice, and squashing baddies with style. Get a full roguelike game experience, boiled down to its essence, and captured in a single deck of cards and a handful of dice! One Deck Dungeon is a dungeon crawling adventure game for one or two players."</p>
<p>What did they actually do in the new update? To ensure you can play it nicely it has larger text areas and fonts, along with keybind glyphs setup for the Steam Deck. A few other improvements also landed include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem where Terrorshell's level 3 ability did not always work properly.</li>
<li>Right-stick click will now dismiss the full dungeon card after you bring it up.</li>
<li>Start button will now close the menu after you bring it up.</li>
<li>On the main menu, the back button now correctly quits out of the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>XCOM 2&#39;s multiplayer being removed but will still work on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XCOM 2 developer Firaxis Games has announced that the multiplayer modes are going to be shut down, if you're using the Windows version that is.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/4471402312851-XCOM-2-STEAM-MULTIPLAYER-AND-CHALLENGE-MODE-UPDATE" target="_blank">support article</a>, it notes "As a heads up to the XCOM 2 community, we wanted to share that we will be retiring services for Multiplayer and Challenge Mode for the Steam version of the game". Why? Resources (money): "The decision to retire these services isn’t something done lightly, but it does allow us to refocus our resources". Planned for March 28, it's a shame but there's an interesting silver lining here. If you run Linux, or the Steam Deck, you will still be able to play it online as it also mentions how "this won’t affect <em>XCOM 2</em> on console platforms, or on Mac and Linux".</p>
<p>That's definitely a strange turn of events, with the Linux and macOS versions being done externally by Feral Interactive.</p>

<p>However, things can change and it's entirely possible Feral could eventually update the port in some way to also remove multiplayer at any point. For Steam Deck, the "Playable" verification was done using the Steam Play Proton compatibility layer, so you would need to switch it to the Native Linux build for online modes to work after March 28 (<a href="https://youtu.be/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">video guide</a>).</p>
<p>That same issue can happen to any game across any platform, nothing is forever — unless developers and publishers offer up server files to players like the good old days.</p>

      <title>Bungie has more to say on Destiny 2 for Steam Deck and it&#39;s still a no</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-say-a-big-fat-no-to-proton-and-steam-deck-for-destiny-2/" target="_blank">I highlighted</a> that Bungie gave a very clear no to Destiny 2 on Steam Deck. Seems a lot of people noticed and Bungie has issued an update — but it's still a no for now.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/51132" target="_blank">This Week At Bungie</a> blog post, they said they would provide "additional information" and went on to reiterate they wish to keep a "secure environment for Destiny 2", going on to remind people they teamed up with BattlEye (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" target="_blank">which supports Linux / Proton</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to maintain a secure environment for Destiny 2, as it features both PvE and PvP combat in an evolving, dynamic world. Maintaining the integrity of our security is a complex and long-term process. In some cases it means teaming with partners like BattlEye and following their recommendations, in others, it means choosing to not support platforms that could provide bad actors with ways of compromising our own Bungie developed anti-cheat security systems. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck continues to be an unsupported platform for Destiny 2, at least with SteamOS 3 Linux which it comes with out of the box. Their wording here is interesting though. It sounds like either BattlEye recommended against it, or they at Bungie specifically chose not to as they think Linux will somehow provide a way for these "bad actors" to compromise their game.</p>
<p>They did say they will continue to investigate but they have no other info. So really, they've not actually explained anything extra at all. How helpful.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6mj_CL7oRhA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc68622dbf5899d1fbf0b7673a143e58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6mj_CL7oRhA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, although no announcement has yet been made, <a href="https://youtu.be/roK0SUhP9Ro" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a> continues working just fine on Steam Deck and Linux desktops with Proton as Easy Anti-Cheat now seems to be hooked up. No one from Valve or EA / Respawn has replied to my emails on it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Verified and Playable hit a thousand games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just about a week after the Steam Deck formally released, we have officially hit over one thousand games that are either Steam Deck Verified or Playable. Quite a fun milestone that, however quality is better than quantity and there's been some <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1498970401354964993" target="_blank">rather curious titles</a> that have been through verification recently.</p>
<p>The hard numbers as it stands right now (<a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>532 - Verified</li>
<li>471 - Playable</li>
<li>710 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently verified / playable titles include: Spirit of the North, FIFA 22, Day of Infamy, Bastion, KeeperRL, Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix and Alan Wake.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that the Unsupported category is growing quickly, with a lot of titles thrown into it over the last few days. These include: Persona 5 Strikers, Disgaea 5 Complete, Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition, SMITE, Mortal Kombat 11, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Call of Duty: World at War and Arma 3.</p>
<p>Something <em>strange</em> has been happening though with Deck Verified on the titles being tagged as Unsupported. Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition as a first example is Unsupported, even though I tested it just this morning working <em>without issue</em>. Children of Morta is also set as Unsupported, I just tested it working fine. Europa Universalis IV as well is apparently Unsupported and yet it works. All tagged to use Proton too, and checking on each with the Native Linux build, they all also worked fine.</p>
<p><em>There's likely a longer list of this so I've contacted Valve to see what's going on there.</em></p>
<p>There's times Deck Verified <em>is</em> still working as expected though, like with Project Zomboid. Although they picked Proton here by default, and it doesn't run so they've set it as Unsupported. I thought perhaps there was an issue again with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/valve-clarifies-how-they-test-native-linux-or-proton-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">picking Proton first</a> instead of the Native Linux build, but that also doesn't run correctly with a wrong resolution and then a crash when trying to enter the game (I've sent the developer The Indie Stone details on this to help them).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3131695559740188755" target="_blank">formally addressed</a> the false negative verification reports in a new post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If 99% of a game's functionality is accessible, but accessing one optional in-game minigame crashes, or one tutorial video doesn't render, that's Unsupported.<br/>
<br/>
For now! This is by design: around the launch timeframe, we believed it was more valuable to prevent false positives ("this game is Verified but part of it doesn't work"), even at the cost of some appearance of false negatives ("this game is Unsupported but I didn't notice anything wrong with it"). Even with the current standards, at the rate both we and partners are making improvements, we expect you'll see many titles transition over the next few weeks from Playable, or even Unsupported, to Verified. We also expect our standards and thinking will adjust as we move farther from launch and get much more feedback from customers and developers.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher now works nicely on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that I've been asked, repeatedly (and then some), is to show the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> on the Steam Deck. So here we are, let's take a look. <u>See also</u>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">installing Discord and the Epic Store directly</a>.</p>
<p>This had to wait, as there we some issues in both Heroic and an extra tool we needed called the Heroic Bash Launcher. I've been constantly speaking to the developer about it along with the issues, and now the fixes are live for everyone. Using the Epic Store with Rocket League for the guide, since it's free to play. While Heroic supports GOG, currently you can't add the games from GOG to Steam just yet with the AppImage.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="89Dw3I6NJX4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab68bb9fbcf826dffe46220af7e968e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/89Dw3I6NJX4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into Desktop mode. Steam button -&gt; Power menu -&gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, <a href="https://github.com/derrod/legendary/releases/" target="_blank">Legendary</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/redromnon/HeroicBashLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Bash Launcher</a>.</li>
<li>Run the Heroic AppImage and Login.</li>
<li>In the Heroic Games Launcher, go into the settings and set the "Choose an Alternative Legendary Binary" option to the Legendary file downloaded. Make sure to set the Legendary file in your Downloads as executable (Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Permissions).</li>
<li>Download a game. If you wish, you can also change the version of Proton / Wine / <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom" target="_blank">Wine-GE</a> used in the settings of the game once downloaded (the option doesn't appear until installed). Proton may have issues outside of Steam, use whatever works for you.</li>
<li>Run the Heroic Bash Launcher, which will generate a launch script for any game downloaded in the "GameFiles" folder.</li>
<li>Add the generated launch script to Steam using the Add a Non-Steam game option (Games menu, or big button in the bottom left of Steam)</li>
<li>Done. Your game from Heroic + Epic should now run.</li>
</ol>
<p>As per usual a note: this does not include games with anti-cheat from the Epic Store.</p>

      <title>GOG suspends all sales in Russia and Belarus</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the ongoing brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, many more companies are taking action and now <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> has made a big announcement with their store.</p>
<p>Here's the statement they provided about the decision to suspend activities in Russia and Belarus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In light of the Russian military invasion in our neighboring country of Ukraine, until further notice, we made the decision to halt all sales in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>Effective March 3rd, 2022, we suspend sales of all games distributed on the GOG platform on the territories of Russia and Belarus. While buying products on GOG is not possible, users from the affected territories can still log in to their accounts and keep access to purchased items.</p>
<p>The entire CD PROJEKT Group stands firm with the people of Ukraine. While we are not a political entity capable of directly influencing state matters, and don’t aspire to be one, we do believe that commercial entities, when united, have the power to inspire global change in the hearts and minds of ordinary people. We know that players in Russia and Belarus, individuals who have nothing to do with the invasion of Ukraine, will be impacted by this decision, but with this action we wish to further galvanize the global community to speak about what is going on in the heart of Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GOG has also recently, which I missed (sorry!), been helping <a href="https://www.gog.com/promo/20220302_support_ukraine" target="_blank">a few developers</a> give 100% of the sales money to charity. This includes games like This War of Mine, Slipways, MouseCraft and more. It's not up for much longer though.</p>

      <title>Boxes within boxes, puzzle game Patrick&#39;s Parabox releases March 29</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Patrick's Parabox, a very clever puzzle game is going to release on March 29. This might actually be one of my most anticipated releases this year. I tested out the demo in a previous Steam Festival and absolutely fell in love with the idea.</p>
<p>"Patrick's Parabox is an award-winning puzzle game that explores a unique recursive system of boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes. Learn to manipulate the world's structure by pushing boxes into and out of each other. Wrap your head around what happens when a box contains itself, and learn to use infinity to your advantage. Explore many more mechanics and recursive twists as you delve deeper and deeper into the system. It's boxes all the way down."</p>
<p>You'll find over 350 hand-crafted levels with this one, all of which will make you work your brain a little. The developer stated that every puzzle has a new idea, so you're not doing the same thing constantly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rl_ohYPXNMo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cca7726f590ce6ecd60a30075b988289.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rl_ohYPXNMo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Castlevania Advance Collection works on Steam Deck, despite what Konami say</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, Konami released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1552550/view/3100169918043313807" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the Castlevania Advance Collection <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552550/Castlevania_Advance_Collection/" target="_blank">Steam store</a> page to say it does not work on the Steam Deck. It does. <u>Note</u>: personal purchase.</p>
<p>The statement reads: "Before purchasing this software, please be advised that it cannot be played on Steam Deck as it does not support SteamOS.". Clearly then they don't understand how Linux, SteamOS, Proton or Steam Deck works. As usual, I'm here to clear things up — as it really works just fine.</p>
<p>Not only does it work completely out of the box with Proton 7.0-1 on my Linux desktop, it also works perfectly on the Steam Deck (Proton 7 is the default), as I shall demonstrate in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kfeYn7udSew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6a2444b41a53d78448818927c10b742.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kfeYn7udSew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Checked this one out at many user requests.</em></p>
<p>Every game in the collection was tested working. Saving and loading with their in-built system also works, as does their fancy rewind feature. It even warns you with a silly screen to mention it doesn't support plugging in earphones / unplugging during gameplay. You should have seen my confused face when seeing that warning screen. That also works just fine.</p>
<p>I can see no reason to skip it if you were looking to buy it.</p>

<p>Want to support the people of Ukraine and get a little something in return perhaps? There's a huge amount of developers throwing their support in and even John Romero has appeared with a new DOOM II level.</p>
<p>Named "<a href="https://romero.com/shop/p/onehumanity" target="_blank">One Humanity</a>", it's available for a donation of €5.00 and it's to "support the people of Ukraine and the humanitarian efforts of the Red Cross and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund" with 100% of the proceeds going towards the support.</p>
<p>This is Romero's first DOOM II level since the release of the original. To play, it says you need a copy of DOOM II and a modern source port (like <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads" target="_blank">GZDoom</a>, which will <a href="https://youtu.be/ydyG3N4Y_jU" target="_blank">run on the Steam Deck</a> too).</p>

      <title>Popular vehicle building sandbox &#39;SimplePlanes&#39; updates for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more developers get their games ready to be played on the Steam Deck! SimplePlanes looks like a lot of fun and it's quite a popular one too. Not quite as simple as the name suggests though, with tons of parts to snap together and plenty of physics fun going on. It's also not just about aircraft, as you can build all sorts of things to mess around with.</p>
<p>The developer didn't go into a whole lot of detail on what they changed, just noting in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/397340/announcements/detail/3138450510784639518" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "SimplePlanes version 1.12.125.0 is now live. With the update comes all the necessary tweaks and changes to make SimplePlanes a great experience on the Steam Deck. We hope you enjoy it and please provide us feedback on ways we can further enhance your experience on the Steam Deck. Thanks for playing!".</p>

      <title>Toy train set sandbox &#39;Tracks&#39; gets upgraded for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love trains? Tracks looks like quite a sweet little game really and it has a new release out to help with Steam Deck compatibility. Tracks hasn't yet been through any verification though, keep that in mind.</p>
<p>"Tracks is a beautiful toy train set builder which gives you the tools to play without limits. Jump into an expansive sandbox and lay down track pieces, create bridges and build towns with Tracks’ easy to get to grips with gameplay. Once you’re ready, hop into the driver’s seat and ride your little train in first-person view – controlling the speed and direction, as you ride the rails." — Whoop Group, developer.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/657240/announcements/detail/3124937623717201942" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Korean language support</li>
<li>Overhauled the language selection menu</li>
<li>Improved accuracy of Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese translations</li>
<li>Fixed various small issues relating to the Steam Deck / gamepad support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, the developer noted it now supports Steam Input and brings up the keyboard properly for entering text with a gamepad and they have formally submitted the game for Deck verification now.</p>

      <title>vkd3d version 1.3 released from the Wine team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton that the Valve team work on, the original vkd3d from the Wine team continues to be updated and a new release is out now. For anyone confused, both of them translate Direct3D 12 to Vulkan.</p>
<p>For one thing, Valve is naturally focused only on gaming, which can often come with the drawback of needing the most up to date drivers and not supporting older systems, whereas the Wine team have to support pretty much any software that could run on Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://source.winehq.org/git/vkd3d.git/blob_plain/vkd3d-1.3:/ANNOUNCE" target="_blank">Version 1.3</a> brings with it initial HLSL compilation support, shader model 5.1 descriptor array support and support for disassembling Direct3D shaders. There's a huge amount more to the release than that, those are just the main feature highlights but the release notes do go into plenty more detail.</p>

      <title>Virgo Versus The Zodiac gets an official Linux release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Virgo Versus The Zodiac, what the developer says is an "unforgiving timed actions turn-based JRPG", has been released officially for Linux (and macOS). Inspired by the Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series and the Mother RPG series.</p>
<p>"The game features traditional turn-based combat with real-time execution of moves: blocking, countering and timing your attacks carefully as well as predicting your foes' moves is essential to succeed in Virgo’s twisted and unforgiving cosmic quest to bring back the Golden Age, a period of peace, symmetry and balance, or so she thinks."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1rHIh270pjA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e96f388e6875158bfb1fdd5ba98b123a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1rHIh270pjA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/920320/view/3135071990843510947" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the developer said: "We have now full support for MAC and LINUX users with native builds for this platform, as promised before. Not only that, the Korean fan translation worked on by Gemini was fully integrated into the full game and you can now choose it from the dropdown menu on settings. Degica logo was also removed from the main game, as Virgo Versus The Zodiac is now being self published."</p>
<p>Nice to see more sweet looking indie gives decide to support Linux directly like this.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/920320/Virgo_Versus_The_Zodiac/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included got a few improvements recently to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei Entertainment did say in their January Roadmap that support for the Steam Deck would come, and some of that work has now be made live. This doesn't sound like they're done yet but it all sounds like good work towards it. The update actually landed on the Steam Deck launch day, which I missed as of course that day was ridiculously busy to keep track of everything.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better controller support for Steam users using Big Picture Mode:</li>
<li>Wider range of actions that can be activated by a controller.</li>
<li>Mouse/trackpad is still the most comfortable way to play, but a controller can now activate a virtual cursor</li>
<li>Added default controller configurations for: Steam Deck, Xbox 360 Controller, Xbox Wireless Controller, DUALSHOCK™4 Wireless Controller</li>
<li>Steam Deck support.</li>
<li>Minor UI adjustments to support smaller resolutions.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Duplicants could get stuck depressurizing an Oil Well.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>ONI is surprisingly playable with gamepad controls on a Steam Deck. Looks great on the screen too, can't wait to see what other improvements they have coming for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8946910111646233817gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p>This next one will raise some eyebrows. It's <u><strong>not</strong></u> in any way confirmed official yet but it does work on Linux / Proton and Steam Deck. We reached out to Valve about it, so far no reply. EA / Respawn have also said nothing. Keep that in mind, so Apex Legends works but seemingly everyone is being silent on an announcement.</p>

      <title>Fantasy themed tactical card game &#39;Dragon Evo&#39; enters Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dragon Evo is a fresh entry into the deck-building tactical card game genre and it's now available in Early Access, along with Linux support too. Inspired by RPGs with a little sprinkle of RTS with the, it's actually quite a unique game although it does have some rough edges with it not being complete yet.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot to take in right away too with their health and action system. Card have different attack categories including close combat, ranged, flying or burrowing attacks. Each has a strength and weakness too, so you're always thinking and planning while playing. It's a deck-builder, so you get to make up your own pack and you earn more while you play too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l3bTLrPpuQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e5518cc581049019d2de7ee199999e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l3bTLrPpuQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For their first game, Bromantic Games have done quite well here. Hopefully it will find an audience as it's far better than a lot of other attempts to take a different approach in card games. The complexity is something that will hold it back though, as it doesn't quite flow as well as other card games. The initial tutorial does end up dumping quite a bit of info on you but if you manage to push through it, you might find you like it.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808620/Dragon_Evo/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Free stealth game The Dark Mod v2.10 is a HUGE upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the Thief series, The Dark Mod is a brilliant free and open source game and game engine for people to make various levels with. <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/posts/the-dark-mod-2-10-has-been-released/" target="_blank">The Dark Mod version 2.10</a> is out now and it's BIG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6845431151646229129gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6845431151646229129gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Just for players, here's the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loading Times - Considerable effort has gone into streamlining how textures are loaded, making more effective use of multiple CPU cores, and removing artificial delays. This even includes new handwritten algorithms for normalmap compression and mipmap generation so that TDM no longer relies on graphics card drivers.</li>
<li>Performance Improvements - As part of ongoing performance improvements, soft stencil shadows with anti-alising will be faster to render.</li>
<li>Object Handling - Afraid to grab a candle near a sleeping guard? Handling objects will now produce less noise, or none at all if holding down the “creep” button. You can also now control how far an item is thrown based on how long you hold down the “throw” button. Lastly, dragging unconscious bodies should feel better now (even if rats did their best to spoil the fun a little).</li>
<li>Main Menu Interactions - Tooltips have been added for many of the items found in the settings menu: a long-awaited feature! We’ve also reorganized the procedure for switching between missions to make it more intuitive for newcomers.</li>
<li>Window / Input Changes - The Linux build now relies on the GLFW library to create windows and handle the keyboard &amp; mouse, eliminating many of the issues with OS integration on Linux. On the Windows side, some minor changes were made to fullscreen/borderless modes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For mappers though, it gets real interesting! They added support for Volumetric Lights (“God Rays”), more image formats, main menu customizations, new scripting events and so on — lots of new toys for level creators for have fun with and to go along with it the six new missions released for the 2.10 Connections Contest are now officially available in the mission downloader and they take advantage of the new features.</p>

      <title>Bomb Club Deluxe is an explosive puzzle game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bomb Club Deluxe from Antoine Latour and Lozange Lab is a fresh and quality puzzle game, all about setting off explosive chain reactions to solve a level. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>Health and safety? What's that? Never heard of it. Let the chaos flow. The concept of Bomb Club Deluxe is simple: you need to wipe the board of bombs, by placing more bombs and letting them all go pop. It's simple and effective, with a ton of playable levels (200+!) to keep you going for quite a while. The bombs all have ridiculous faces too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9Z3Ovn-baZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a55b1cb4da2f172249f0dc9f0da20c8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9Z3Ovn-baZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More than 20 bombs and a dozen hats to discover as you travel the world</li>
<li>More than 200 hand-made levels</li>
<li>A vast non-linear map to explore, full of surprises and optional levels</li>
<li>Easy to pick up, hard to master. You'll never be stuck, but prepare to be challenged if you want to be!</li>
<li>A loveable cast of characters</li>
<li>A full story and dialogues to keep you engaged. Those can be skipped if you're only here for the puzzles!</li>
<li>Colorful, comic-like visuals, and a soundtrack inspired by videogame classics.</li>
<li>Soundtrack as free DLC</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly with their native Linux version on desktop and it's a whole lot of fun. Really great to have such an easy recommendation like this. For Steam Deck, things are different. It doesn't have controller support and is not currently verified but it does work perfectly with the mouse / keyboard emulation in Steam Input and Touchscreen too!</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771440/Bomb_Club_Deluxe/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve expect to make &#39;hundreds of thousands&#39; of Steam Decks next month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a fresh interview with IGN, Valve developer Lawrence Yang spoke about a number of things and it sounds like you may get your Steam Deck perhaps a little sooner than expected.</p>
<p>Right now, Valve use a special queue system giving reservations a rather broad time on when to expect a Steam Deck delivery like Q2 or after-Q2. The good news is though, production is quickly ramping up. Yang mentioned how "in production terms it'll ramp very quickly, in the first month very quickly we'll be in the tens of thousands, by the second month we'll be in the hundreds of thousands and beyond that it'll grow even quicker". Yang also mentioned how once they get into the after-Q2 launch period, things will get a lot clearer.</p>
<p>Full video is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okANKhicgkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/745c497fbab5038ef8ef6f4cead66453.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okANKhicgkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sadly Valve will not give numbers yet but they do seem surprised at the level of sales on the Deck. Sounds like it has pretty clearly been a hit already, which is good news!</p>
<p>Yang also made it clear they are in touch with many developers to get them to support the Deck. That goes for both fixing bugs in Proton and helping developers to enable anti-cheat. Just yesterday we saw Apex Legends start working (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roK0SUhP9Ro" target="_blank">my video</a>), although no one has announced anything on it yet.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets an OS update to help solve stick drift</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As more people get their shiny new Steam Deck, more problems will inevitably appear not just because hardware can never be perfect but as more system updates roll out — there's a bigger chance for problems and recently stick drift became an issue.</p>
<p>Posting on Reddit, a couple of users (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/t49415/unfortunately_im_already_experiencing_stick_drift/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/t49im8/experiencing_stick_drift_on_the_right_stick/" target="_blank">#2</a>) showed some pretty bad stick drift, something other console makers have also had to deal with and it can be a really big issue. Particularly problematic on the Nintendo Switch with the Joy-Cons, something I've personally experienced.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems in this case it was a software problem and not a hardware defect, as Valve developer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1498839079558926341" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all, a quick note about Steam Deck thumbsticks. The team has looked into the reported issues and it turns out it was a deadzone regression from a recent firmware update. We just shipped a fix to address the bug, so make sure you’re up to date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how, unlike the normal Switch models, you can't just easily grab a new controller with the Steam Deck as it's all stuck together inside the casing, this would have been quite the problem for new Deck owners. Let's just hope that Valve is already learning lessons on their update rollouts so things like this don't sneak past them.</p>

      <title>Bungie say a big fat no to Proton and Steam Deck for Destiny 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Were you hoping to play Destiny 2 on Steam Deck or a Linux desktop using Proton? Well, you're currently out of luck. Their updated <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049024592-Destiny-2-Steam-Guide" target="_blank">Steam Guide</a> has a newer section just for Steam Deck and it's not good news.</p>
<p>Like a lot of bigger games, they don't support Linux either natively or at all and right now it appears they don't have any plans to either. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Destiny 2 is not supported for play on the Steam Deck or on any system utilizing Steam Play's Proton unless Windows is installed and running.  Players who attempt to launch Destiny 2 on the Steam Deck through SteamOS or Proton will be unable to enter the game and will be returned to their game library after a short time.</p>
<p>Players who attempt to bypass Destiny 2 incompatibility will be met with a game ban.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've already seen a few places jump on that last line but it's pretty <em>normal</em>. Anyone who works around anti-cheat in online games, would face a ban. I mean, that's obvious really isn't it?</p>
<p><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3179349831646179531gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3179349831646179531gol1.jpg"/></a>Note: Destiny 2 already has a full Linux port, since it runs on Stadia and it was properly ported for it.</em></p>
<p>For Destiny 2 to work with Proton if they decided not to bring over their Stadia Linux port to Steam, one thing Bungie would need to do is speak to BattlEye which it now uses, although that's only supposed to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" target="_blank">a little email away</a> to get hooked up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I don't want to hype it up too much just yet but Apex Legends now works on Linux with Proton and the Steam Deck. I even captured <a href="https://youtu.be/roK0SUhP9Ro" target="_blank">a little rough video</a> for you. No confirmation yet to be clear so it's not official as far as I am concerned, so I'm hoping it's not another case of a game that will stop working in a day or two like has happened previously with multiple games. Given the Steam Deck is here though, and Apex had a dedicated Steam Deck branch we saw on SteamDB — I remain hopeful on that.</p>

      <title>Aperture Desk Job from Valve is out now and it&#39;s ridiculous</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aperture Desk Job is the latest game from Valve, it's free but it's also just a tech demo to show off the Steam Deck controls and features. It's actually a really charming and quite comical experience set in the Portal world but no it's not Portal 3.</p>
<p>"Aperture Desk Job reimagines the been-there-done-that genre of walking simulators and puts them in the lightning-spanked, endorphin-gorged world of sitting still behind things. You play as an entry-level nobody on their first day at work — your heart full of hope and your legs full of dreams, eager to climb that corporate ladder. But life’s got other plans, and they all involve chairs. Designed as a free playable short for Valve’s new Steam Deck, Desk Job walks you through the handheld’s controls and features, while not being nearly as boring as that sounds." — Valve.</p>
<p>You get to test all the controls including the microphone, touchscreen and gyro aiming while also destroying things with a toilet that has turrets attached to it. A very deadly toilet. You will also come across various other household appliances that have weapons attached, it's completely ridiculous but a lot of fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mVDFJRM6F9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c78fe937821c78f8a969d34932c8b5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mVDFJRM6F9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Easily the absolute stupidest thing I've played this year I think, and I say that in the nicest possible way because it's easily worth playing through. Doesn't last long though, at only 30 minutes but worth a go.</p>
<p>Shot taken from Deck:</p>

<p>You don't actually need a Steam Deck to play it, as it's a controller game. Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Collabora talk briefly about their work with Valve on SteamOS, Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora, the open source consulting firm that often works with Valve, has a <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/portable-linux-gaming-with-the-steam-deck.html" target="_blank">new blog post</a> out from developer Simon McVittie talking a little about their work on SteamOS and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>SteamOS 2 was originally based on Debian Linux, but this was changed with the new SteamOS 3 to be based on Arch Linux. So yes, for those who still don't know — the Steam Deck runs Linux! It's a Linux handheld gaming PC! I covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">in an initial review</a>, so be sure to take a look.</p>
<p>What's interesting is the explanation of how the update system works that Collabora helped to create:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handheld device needs a solid update framework, so one of Collabora's major contributions to SteamOS 3 was to help implement seamless system updates. With its new “A/B” design, there are now two operating system partitions, with two different versions of SteamOS. When upgrading, a new operating system image is written to whichever partition is not currently in use, before rebooting the system. A specialized bootloader module then automatically selects the newer operating system and boots into it. If the upgrade was successful, you continue to use the new OS, and the previous system partition is reused for the next upgrade. If the upgraded version does not boot successfully, then the bootloader automatically falls back to the previous system partition, and you can try again later. Of course, new operating system images are downloaded with block-based deltas, so only the changed parts need to be re-downloaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Collabora are also part of the team that created Pressure Vessel, the container system that Proton and the Steam Deck use to run games inside for a consistent environment. They say to think of it "a bit like a simplified version of Flatpak for Steam games".</p>

      <title>Web store Fanatical offers up Steam Deck categories to buy games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the simplest way to get games for the Steam Deck will be direct from Steam, there's a few other stores out there that do give some amazing deals and Fanatical is one of the best. <u>Note</u>: we're not currently affiliated in any way.</p>
<p>Originally called Bundle Stars, Fanatical (like Humble Store) offers up Steam keys and they also do bundles too. Seems they've been keeping a close eye on the industry, and they've tweaked their store now to offer up <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/steam-deck-games" target="_blank">proper Steam Deck categories</a>.</p>
<p>Not only that, they also correctly list games as either Verified or Playable with an explanation on what they mean — so they've done a bit more than just stick games into a category. This is actually great, and I hope we eventually see more stores do the same.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - using Luxtorpeda for Morrowind, Warzone 2100 and X-COM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck is clearly great with a lot of modern titles and plenty of AAA games, but what about the classics? For that Luxtorpeda can provide a great experience on Deck.</p>
<p>It's a tool I've covered a number of times for Linux desktop users, however it works beautifully on the Steam Deck too. <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a tool to run native Linux game engines for various classics like Morrowind, Warzone 2100, X-COM and quite a lot more. Why would you want to use it? Well, a lot of these game engines are vast improvements over the original games and get around a lot of their limits along with improving them for modern platforms.</p>
<p>Here's a video HOWTO look at them all:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BxIKfWGdSh0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e793555e6ab33bed36d08111e87bfb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BxIKfWGdSh0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I made use of another great tool called <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, which enables you to download extra compatibility layers like Luxtorpeda and Proton-GE with a few simple clicks. It couldn't get easier than this.</p>
<p>For this video, I worked with the developer of Luxtorpeda to sort through a couple of issues and make a new release and will continue to provide feedback on it to make it the best experience possible.</p>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download ProtonUp-QT (<a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a> / Discover Software Centre).</li>
<li>Close Steam.</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-QT, and pick Luxtorpeda from the drop-down options.</li>
<li>Reload Steam once Luxtorpeda is downloaded (this refreshes the Steam Play tool list).</li>
<li>Pick a game in your Library that's supported by Luxtorpeda (list <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>
<li>Go into the game Properties, select Compatibility, put a tick in the box and select Luxtorpeda from the drop-down box.</li>
<li>Launch your game and enjoy.</li>

      <title>Valheim updated with full gamepad and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to wander through the Black Forest from your bed, as Valheim now has a fresh update available that was previously in a public Beta to add in gamepad support and work nicely with the Steam Deck. It's the same Beta we <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/valheim-has-a-beta-with-steam-deck-fixes-gamepad-support-frost-caves/" target="_blank">wrote about previously</a> but it's now available for everyone.</p>
<p>Want to see it on the Steam Deck? Got you covered:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GcAFtLceVy0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c37ff7c4d5884378fa7432627dd70da.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GcAFtLceVy0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>By default, it appears that Valve picked Proton 7.0-1 for Valheim to run on Deck, even though it has a fully supported and nicely working native Linux version. It's not clear why they picked Proton but there you have it. After doing some testing, I can safely say this is going to be awesome on a Steam Deck. While it has a few performance issues here and there, a lot of games are the same with stuttering when bits load in, which will improve over time. It's comfortable as heck with Deck controls though, the Valheim team did a <strong>great</strong> job on controller support.</p>
<p>The non-spoiler patch notes include these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">New Content:</div>
<p><br/>
* Suddenly… Frost Caves!<br/>
* Anniversary drinking horn added. Skål!</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">Fixes &amp; Improvements:</div>
<p><br/>
* Pause function in singleplayer<br/>
* Full controller support! (Gamepad legend and alternative glyphs)<br/>
* Gamepad text input when running through in steam big picture mode<br/>
* UI, settings and Steam Deck fixes<br/>
* FPS Limiter and reduced background performance<br/>
* Split dialog can take numeric input<br/>
* Signs can now be built without a workbench<br/>
* Bug fixes and quality of life improvements<br/>
* Armour stand now supports atgeirs and shield styles<br/>
* Nomap mode tweaks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Dying Light gets a cross-play update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland might have their shiny new Dying Light 2 now available but they're apparently not even finished with the first Dying Light with a big update out now.</p>
<p>Not another content upgrade though, this time they upgraded their networking. This allows for cross-play between all PC platforms including Steam, Epic, GOG across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux! You really do have to hand it to Techland on how long they've supported this one for now, as it released back in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9957114911646134626gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Looks like a lot of players have moved over to Dying Light 2 now, as you can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/239140/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> around the release that the player count of Dying Light 1 began to drop.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dying-light-hellraid?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300710/Dying_Light__Hellraid/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dying_light_the_following_enhanced_edition" target="_blank">GOG</a> doesn't provide a Linux build but you can probably run their Windows version with Wine, or add it to Steam to use Proton anyway.</p>

      <title>Inscryption from Daniel Mullins Games gets a Linux Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's your chance to help test another upcoming native Linux build, as Daniel Mullins Games have put up a Beta you can try for Inscryption. This is the massively popular game that blends together deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1092790/view/3132820824668116787" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said "With Kaycee's Mod wrapping up and with some help from a new member of the Inscryption team, we are finally tackling the Mac and Linux ports. Playtesting it will help us out a lot!". You can opt-in with the password "mealwormsigil" and then give it a spin.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13127741611646132266gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13127741611646132266gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Giving it a run myself after picking up a copy (pictured above from the Beta), it seems to run great. Haven't spotted any obvious issues so far. Also, wow — this is a really weird game. Considering it's the same developer as Pony Island, I'm not exactly surprised though!</p>
<p>Once it's out of Beta and ready for everyone, we will let you know.</p>
<p>You can buy it for a Steam key on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/inscryption?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/" target="_blank">Steam</a> directly.</p>

      <title>Watch Valve&#39;s Gabe Newell deliver some Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes it's true, Gabe Newell of Valve really did go around delivering a Steam Deck to various people and now there's an official video on it. I'm not jealous at all.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9Dy-KWjp-m0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/abdbb91964eb275393e6583e3c04c7f5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9Dy-KWjp-m0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A fun bit of marketing but it goes to show how close Valve's co-founder is to the project as a whole. It's quite wholesome to see really and shows Newell's clear passion for the Steam Deck and Valve as a whole. Not only that, I think it goes to show how important the Steam Deck is for the future of Valve too.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the end of the month we shall see a lot more people have their unit in hand, so we can have more gamers on Deck.</p>
<p>When is yours arriving? Let us know in the comments.</p>

      <title>dbrand announces Steam Deck screen protectors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only are dbrand working to bring out a fancy case for the Steam Deck with a built-in stand, they've also announced their own <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/tempered-glass-screen-protectors?device=steam-deck#buy" target="_blank">Tempered Glass Screen Protector</a>.</p>
<p>What you get:</p>
<div class="form-section-body">
<ul>
<li>Tempered Glass Screen Protector (×2)</li>
<li>Best-in-Class Touch Screen Sensitivity</li>
<li>Compatible With All Versions of Steam Deck</li>
<li>Alcohol Wipes (×2)</li>
<li>Dust Removal Sticker (×2)</li>
<li>Squeegee</li>
<li>Microfiber Cloth</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6269181301646091955gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Cost: $24.95, with shipping added depending on where you are. To have it shipped to me in the UK with tracking, it would add another $8.95, although without tracking delivery was $5. So together it's about £26.39. I have an order in, so will take a look whenever they arrive and let you know how they are. Same with the case. The Screen Protectors start shipping in April.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes Elden Ring plus Persona 4 Golden for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two popular games should be much better on Linux and Steam Deck with the latest update to Proton Experimental. What is Proton? It's a compatibility layer designed to run Windows games from Steam on Linux. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">it in our full guide</a>.</p>
<p>For the latest update released February 28, here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve Elden Ring performance. (we previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/proton-experimental-beta-gets-steam-deck-performance-fix-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank">talked about it here</a>)</li>
<li>Fix Persona 4 Golden lacking audio in the cutscenes.</li>
<li>Update Wine Mono to 7.1.5.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you no longer need the special bleeding-edge Beta to get smoother frames out of Elden Ring, which is nice as it's one less step for people to go through.</p>
<p>To set a game to use Proton Experimental here's what you do:</p>
<div class="content group e-content">
<ol>
<li>Search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library
	<ul>
<li>Right click any game on Steam and go to Properties.</li>
<li>Or for Steam Deck, go to the game's page and hit the COG icon to the right edge, then Properties near the bottom in the menu that appears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the Compatibility menu on the left side panel.</li>
<li>Ensure the "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool" is ticked.</li>
<li>From the dropdown box that appears select Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Done. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

      <title>PipeWire is the future for Linux audio and I am sold on it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux and audio have never entirely gotten along well together, when PulseAudio came along it actually solved a lot of problems but it's <a href="https://pipewire.org/" target="_blank">PipeWire</a> that's the real future.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I was hesitent to switch my own PC over from PulseAudio to PipeWire for fear of breakage, especially with the Steam Deck — I needed things to continue working smoothly. However, I also sometimes tend to just "YOLO" for the fun of it and so I did. I'm now running PipeWire and I have to tell you how happy I am with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire" target="_blank">PipeWire</a> is a project that aims to greatly improve handling of audio and video under Linux. It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy, with supporting Flatpak applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the future of Linux application development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is it powerful, it's also surprisingly easy to use and assorted applications have sprung up around it to support it. Software like <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.pipewire.Helvum" target="_blank">Helvum</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/rncbc/qpwgraph" target="_blank">qpwgraph</a> have absolutely blown my mind on how ridiculously simple they make messing with audio inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>Something I've wanted to do for a long time, but Pulse didn't really help and I didn't like the complexity of JACK was to get different inputs and outputs going for OBS Studio for my livestreams. Things like only having very specific audio go to certain places. Now, it's ridiculously easy.</p>
<p>With the aforementioned applications, you just drag wires between things and…done. That's it. How is Linux audio now this easy?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3171498381646079007gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3171498381646079007gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8520099581646079009gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8520099581646079009gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>For example, grabbing the audio from my shiny Capture Card that's attached between the Steam Deck and my PC, with a drag of a wire I can now have it going to OBS Studio and also have it so only that goes to my Wireless headset. How about music playing that only I can hear? It's a small thing but PipeWire makes everything like that simple. Duplicating and moving audio streams with the drag of a wire. I like simplicity, it makes me happy. There's a huge amount this enables without diving into confusing configuration files, and there's no terminal needed - it's all in the UI. Lovely.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 14: Return to Na Pali</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-13-looks-almost-unreal" target="_blank">Part 13: Looks Almost Unreal</a></strong></p>
<p>One of the selling points of <em>Unreal Tournament</em> pitched to the modding scene by Epic Games was its ability to load assets from the original <em>Unreal</em> into the new engine, further expanding the content base for what was already a highly modifiable game. After a few years this snowballed into a concerted community effort to make the entire <em>Unreal </em>single player mode playable from within its own sequel, bringing it over to Linux in the process.</p>
<p>Installation is simple thanks to the unrealgold-install-436.run installer still hosted on icculus.org extracting the files off the disc and setting up the game as if it were a retail title. Installers are also available for owners of the original <em>Unreal</em> as well as for the <em>Return to Na Pali</em> mission pack, but <em>Unreal Gold</em> is the version that I have on CD-ROM. In fact, the longstanding but now defunct online retailer Tux Games even sold copies of <em>Unreal</em> bundled with the installer.</p>
<p>Again I made some modifications to the Unreal.ini file, switching to the SDLGLDRV renderer with "UseGammaExtension" set to "1" as well as making "Coronas" and "VolumetricLighting" set to "False". I decided to keep dynamic lighting enabled this time as <em>Unreal</em> places a far greater emphasis on darkness for both atmosphere and navigation. Set pieces such as the first Skaarj encounter are undermined by the lights not going out, making it an unacceptable compromise.</p>
<p>It helps that <em>Unreal</em> is not as heavy as <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, being smoother to play even with the frame rate dropping into the low teens when things get intense. To combat this I cranked the resolution all the way down to 512x384 which the engine displayed in the centre of the screen with black borders. This does much to cushion the load brought on by running games at 32 bit colour depth, as was borne out by experimenting with <em>Quake</em> and <em>Quake II</em> as well.</p>
<p>I also changed from the default HUD to prevent notifications appearing over the armour value, with my player character holding her weapon left handed to further embrace not being your typical action game protagonist. <em>Unreal</em> remains notable for defaulting to a heroine, although this can be changed in the options menu. The sex of the narration in <em>Return to Na Pali</em> will also respond to this, with the voice actress putting in the better performance of the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21216824301645565547gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21216824301645565547gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18976715941645524246gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18976715941645524246gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>As far as classic first person shooters go though <em>Unreal</em> is not my favourite, with a good deal of the weapons not gelling with me and a lot of the level designs feeling obtuse. I did find myself enjoying the game more this time than when I first played it a few years ago, as I had more of an inkling of where to go when I got stuck, and the combat seemed less twitchy with the game averaging around 30 frames per second. That said, Na Pali Haven and Nali Castle are clear standouts.</p>
<p>Because the game is running on top of <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, this brings with it a few interesting quirks. The most amusing is the ability to switch cameras to those of the other creatures on the map by pressing F5, as would be used for spectating during tournament matches. It will also list the full details of each map including the author and game type on start up. As these are not used by default you have to bind the "QuickSave" and "QuickLoad" keys in the User.ini file as well.</p>
<p>There is a graphical glitch affecting both the Translator and Nali Fruit Seed icons in your inventory, but this proves not to be a huge deal since they will be buried by other items most of the time, and you can press F2 to invoke the Translator instead. I also encountered a few minor clipping errors and hall of mirror effects while playing, but I am unsure if those were due to how the port was accomplished. All in all an impressive result given how it was done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the mission pack carried over less well. A known issue listed in the README is that all of the added weapon and ship models have transparent rendering errors, something which is less visible if you centre your weapon hand apart from the new rocket launcher. It also played way choppier starting with Glathriel Village up until l left the UMS Prometheus, at which point it smoothed out for what proved to be my favourite stretch of the entire game.</p>
<p>All of which is okay, as thanks to the OldUnreal project <em>Unreal Gold</em> still plays just fine on modern Linux releases, with all of the above issues patched out along with multiplayer support. For the next part I intend to test out another 3D engine, but this one is special due to it being an original creation of the free and open source gaming community. It also happens to be packed with yet another diverting if at times frustrating first person shooter.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire gets Steam Deck and Steam Input compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll soon be throwing cards around and defeating monsters with ease, as Slay the Spire now has proper Steam Input support so it's ready for the Steam Deck. In the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/4776633525082943490" target="_blank">announcement</a>, developer Mega Crit Games mentioned the use of the steamworks4j project to help with this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YpunTOTuOH0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c481330bf2fa6acfe66c264ef9661ebb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YpunTOTuOH0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I did have a bit of quirk here though. Initially, no gamepad input registered at all. Their <a href="http://steam://controllerconfig/646570/2716402470" target="_blank">official config</a> also doesn't yet actually show up in the Steam Input configurator. I managed to get it to load onto the Deck by tapping the link they included in the news post, waited a while and eventually the official config loaded from the link. After that though, it still didn't work.</p>
<p>By default, Slay the Spire uses Proton 7.0-1 on Deck. So I swapped between the three options of the Steam Linux Runtime, where the Native version didn't even launch. Swapping over to Proton Experimental and…gamepad input suddenly fine. Swapped back to Proton 7.0-1 default and…still fine. Seems like there's still a few Steam Input quirks on the Steam Deck. But at least now, and likely by the time more ship out, the official config will be properly loaded in.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that wow — Slay the Spire feels absolutely brilliant on Deck. Fits perfectly with the Deck gamepad controls, which will benefit everyone of course who wants better gamepad support for such an incredible game.</p>
<p>One bit they do need to improve is the save and quit option during a run. It uses the A button, but that's also how you interact with options which gets in the way. They likely forgot about that. If they just set it to X, it would be fine.</p>
<p>In other news, the Downfall - A Slay the Spire Fan Expansion got its own dedicated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865780/Downfall__A_Slay_the_Spire_Fan_Expansion/" target="_blank">Steam store page</a> for a wider release.</p>
<p>Slay the Spire is available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/slay-the-spire?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck — but can it run Crysis Remastered? Yes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You all likely know the meme that Crysis became by now. It used to bring PCs to a halt and make GPUs cry. How about the Steam Deck though? Can it run the newest version with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1715130/Crysis_Remastered/" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered</a>? Yes.</p>
<p>I'm not one to bury the lede and I'll answer that question properly with a video on Medium details:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8MJ8vuwZWSA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/180bc99702807e9d0a37d9d7692e71a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8MJ8vuwZWSA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is actually amazing. I remember playing the original back before I was a full Linux user, and it really didn't work well on my PC at the time. However, it was such a great game overall to run around in. Now you get to experience the latest generation of it on a <em>Linux handheld</em>?! Simply magic. In total shock at how smooth the performance felt on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Note: you can see more videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL YouTube Channel</a>, as I'm not going to announce them all individually in articles. I'll be doing an overview of all my coverage later in the week to help people keep up with it all.</p>

      <title>Factorio devs experimenting with Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factorio is one game that I've yet to try on my Steam Deck but it sounds like it's not ideal right now. Thankfully<br/>
Wube Software LTD. are <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-368" target="_blank">working on it</a>.</p>
<p>The problem, like for a lot of similar such games, is that they were designed primarily for mouse and keyboard. To get them working nicely on a Steam Deck, they need you to make a Steam Input configuration which takes time and even then the experience might still not be ideal. Valve actually sent Wube a Steam Deck so they're working on making it play better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8970332531646056140gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8970332531646056140gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently they're working on bringing over proper controller support to Factorio! That will benefit everyone of course and many more games are doing (or have done already) the same. However, their upcoming expansion is still the priority. For now, they're planning some UI fixes and improvements for the Deck, as it's below the minimum resolution Factorio currently needs.</p>
<p>They did mention a few quick points for now though:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Since it's a native Linux build, you don't have to experiment with or deal with Proton related issues.</li>
<li>The battery life is great. In my test, I got 5 hours and 45 minutes of playtime on one charge, on an average base with average screen brightness.</li>
<li>Performance is good, any reasonable base should run at 60FPS/60UPS.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once they make some improvements, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

      <title>Gabe hand-delivers signed Steam Decks, sounds like a Steam Deck 2 is planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>How would you feel if Valve's Gabe Newell appeared at your front door to deliver a signed Steam Deck? Well, some people got to find out. Also, an overview of a recent IGN interview for you.</p>
<p>There's been quite a few reports now of Newell out and about with a Deck in hand, and it's pretty wholesome but it does sound quite a lot like some sort of marketing stunt. Not that anyone will be complaining about it of course, it's a great way to show it all off. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/t2fmg0/gaben_showed_up_at_my_house_and_delivered_my/hylsx25/" target="_blank">Writing on Reddit</a>, user "bitfiddler0" showed off the signed Deck along with a shot of Newell outside:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5532410671646053231gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5532410671646053231gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17940581751646053233gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17940581751646053233gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Across another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/t2dzar/gabe_newell_delivered_and_autographed_my_steam/hyli46h/" target="_blank">report on Reddit</a>, user "SeattleRainPidgeons" mentioned: "Saw a camera crew going up to my neighbors house while I was loading stuff into my truck. My roommate recognized the guy being followed as Gaben, I didn't believe him, our other roommate then verified it was indeed Gabe. After delivering my neighbor's Deck, we yelled "Hi Gabe!". At which point he asked how many were living in the house, then he went back to his van and grabbed us each a Deck. Was also filmed receiving ours so I assume these will be used in some promo or online. Very cool day."</p>
<p>Meanwhile IGN managed to get Newell to stay still for a little while to have a chat, here's the full video and below will be some notes on what was said:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zw54nB5BQpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9779894b6272798b67a115f41ecf2e8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zw54nB5BQpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A quick overview for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newell feels problems they're solving will help lots of hardware manufacturers in the PC space.</li>
<li>Thinks this is a permanent extension of the PC marketplace.</li>
<li>Said he wanted a device like this since "forever" (didn't we all?).</li>
<li>Expects to see a "wide variety" of hardware devices (meaning more PC portables) and continued innovation in software for it all.</li>
<li>He's been playing Final Fantasy online with family on it.</li>
<li>Newell thinks the Steam Deck is a "pretty good bargain" on the subject of bridging the gap with the shortages and high prices of other hardware.</li>
<li>No plans to increase Steam Deck price.</li>
<li>Far more people having been buying the most expensive model, more than they expected. So they will continue to look at the high-end. The 512GB model has significantly outsold the base 64GB model.</li>
<li>When asked about new Steam Deck models in future, Newell said "absolutely". Valve plans to ride the wave of new hardware, like newer and better AMD chips.</li>
<li>Demand overall is a lot higher than expected.</li>

      <title>GOverlay 0.8 is out with new features to help configure MangoHud</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those just getting into Linux and / or people who will be testing out the Steam Deck, <a href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay" target="_blank">GOverlay</a> can be a bit of a lifesaver to help configure some extra tools like <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a>. Giving you a nice UI instead of diving into configuration files, it's saved me a whole bunch of time.</p>
<p>GOverlay version 0.8 was just released recently. Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Display gamepad controllers battery status (needs xone driver for xbox one and series X controllers)</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Preconfigure color themes (Mangohud default, Simple White, Old Afterburner, Intel + Nvidia, Intel + Radeon, AMD + Nvidia, AMD + Radeon)</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added option FPS_Only to display only FPS value. Issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/issues/192" target="_blank">#192</a></li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added Minimal quick layout with only fps and frametime</li>
<li>FIX: Global enable method updated. Issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/issues/186" target="_blank">#186</a></li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Colors from colorsbuttons resemble but doesn't matched the stock mangohud. Now they do.</li>
<li>FIX: Removed the lines "exec=echo" from baterry config. It seems it were causing steam errors. Issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/issues/178" target="_blank">#178</a></li>
<li>FIX: Custom FPS field was locked to 200. Now the maximum value is 999. Issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/issues/172" target="_blank">#172</a></li>
<li>FIX: Added Dependency checker for Breeze-theme</li>
<li>CHANGE: Changed cpuload color 2 to a lighter orange tone: old $000078FF , new $007FAAFF</li>
<li>CHANGE: Preconfigure layouts now instantly save the new options and update previews</li>
<li>CHANGE: Now a “Config saved” message is also displayed next to the save button. It disapear on mouse enter the mangohud panel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to the developer on <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamimgois/status/1497614444708388868" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they told me clearly that getting it up on <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> is currently a priority, as that will enable easy testing on the Steam Deck since that's the built-in way to install new software in desktop mode (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">covered in an article</a>).</p>

      <title>Terraria gets another update, this time for Steam Deck Optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is terrible news for my free time, as if I didn't have enough to play in bed. Terraria has a new patch out to make it even better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/105600/announcements/detail/3122687725488729261" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "As we have mentioned over the past few months, the team has been hard at work on an update to further optimize Terraria for Steam Deck play - inclusive of performance and controls. With the Steam Deck officially shipping out to players starting today, we are pleased to be able to push this update out to everyone just in time!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/384776191646050273gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/384776191646050273gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What can you expect from it? The developer noted that in their own testing they saw "between 3.5 and 5.5 hours of playtime between charges" which is actually pretty darn good compared to some of the numbers I saw from various other games in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">my initial review</a>. Of course timing depends on what is going on, as games like Terraria are vastly different from one moment to the next.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, I can confirm by default it's using the Native Linux build.</p>
<p>In my own testing today, I would say the developer clearly has more work to do though. I did notice some freezing and stuttering, which seemed like when it was loading in new parts of the world and it did interrupt gameplay quite a bit. Once done though, it was really good and feels <em>amazing</em> with Deck controls. If they can fix the freezing on those parts, it would probably become a Deck favourite.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9034939531646051344gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9034939531646051344gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This update also includes numerous balances changes and bug fixes, along with having the virtual keyboard appear for IP/password entry and other Multiplayer text entry menus.</p>
<p>You can buy Terraria on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/terraria?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/terraria?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Long Dark gets fixed up for Linux with Vulkan and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Long Dark, a very chilly survival game that's not really like any others recently had an upgrade. It's also a Steam Deck Verified title.</p>
<p>Writing in a short and sweet Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/305620/announcements/detail/3088910728288031677" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the developer said: "You'll be happy to know that The Long Dark is Steam Deck verified! Access your Steam library on the go, and use Steam Deck to explore everything the Quiet Apocalypse has to offer. Plus, the Hinterland team has been hard at work on visual and performance improvements on Linux to make your experience on Steam Deck even better. "</p>
<p>For longer than I can remember, The Long Dark suffered some annoying visual bugs on Linux. It's to do with Unity and their OpenGL implementation, with distant textures flickering - something I've seen happen to a few other games. It was very distracting and testing it today on my desktop, the <strong>great</strong> news is that it has been entirely solved.</p>
<p>Looks like for Linux, they actually switched over to Vulkan!</p>

      <title>Developers - let us know if you need help with Steam Deck testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's new handheld PC the Steam Deck is starting to ship out but there's going to be a long wait for some, and others might not be able to get one at all for various reasons - I'm here to help.</p>
<p>Now that any embargo is up and I can do whatever Steam Deck content I like, I had a thought. I know a lot about Linux, and since I have a Steam Deck why not help out those who need it? So that's exactly what I'm announcing: a free Steam Deck testing service for developers.</p>
<p>"You must be crazy doing it free", probably but the Steam Deck is important for Linux as a whole and I <em>personally</em> want to see it succeed. The more games that can get tweaked and fixed before many thousands end up in the hands of regular consumers, the better it will be for <em>everyone</em>. Valve of course have Deck Verified but it's going to take a long time to get through the tens of thousands on Steam and more releasing every day. It's also difficult to test on something you don't have, patches might need re-testing and so on you get the idea I'm sure.</p>
<p>How will it work? Developers just need to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/email-us/" target="_blank">send an email</a> and it will go into a queue. Be sure to include one single Steam key in case I don't already own it, and notes on any Beta I might need to opt into (don't forget a password if it needs one). If there's any performance concerns, a save game ready to check would be helpful.</p>
<p><em>While I won't take any payment at all for it, as I will be doing it because I want to, I do accept any no-strings donations and regular support via Patreon, see more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" target="_blank">the Support Us page</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Proton Experimental Beta gets Steam Deck performance fix for ELDEN RING</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you finding that ELDEN RING has some mad stuttering when loading things in the background? Valve has released an update for Proton Experimental in the bleeding-edge Beta to help.</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1497721812699860994" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The graphics team has been hard at work on optimizing ELDEN RING for Steam Deck. Fixes for heavy stutter during background streaming of assets will be available in a Proton release next week, but are available to test now on the bleeding-edge branch of Experimental.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck specifically is mentioned, but if you see the same issue on desktop Linux it's worth a try too for ELDEN RING. Amazing to see Valve act so quickly to improve such a fresh game release.</p>
<p>How to access the bleeding-edge branch? It's very simple. For Steam Deck users, here's a quick howto:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c1SiIp8KJm0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c77d921ddb0890af09984eb2c60bdb1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c1SiIp8KJm0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>A good excuse to show off the Steam Green keyboard theme…</em></p>
<p>For desktop users: simply search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library, open the right click Properties menu and go to the Betas tab. Then just select bleeding-edge from the dropdown box and let it update.</p>
<p>It's not wise to keep that on all the time, as it can have breakage but if you really want ELDEN RING to perform a bit better now - do it.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/elden-ring?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1497721209043050496" target="_blank">more fixes</a> came in for: Fable, The Force Unleashed 2, and GTA IV with Proton. However, you don't need any software update. Just restart Steam or your Deck to pick it up, as Valve has just enabled a few <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=14078130" target="_blank">special options</a> to launch with.</p>

      <title>Albion Online getting gamepad support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Running some errands and doing some guild battles in Albion Online on the go, or in bed? Why not. Albion Online is getting gamepad support real soon. In a fresh <a href="https://albiononline.com/en/news/controller-support-begins" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer announced that testing will open up on March 2.</p>
<p>Support will not only include the Steam Deck but also "a wide range of standard PC and console controllers" which is fantastic. I can imagine that opening the game up to a much bigger audience. This is only the start though, it will take time for them to optimize the experience for gamepads for a full proper release of it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7925414871645898252gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7925414871645898252gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Annoyingly though, it's still not possible to link an existing account to the game on Steam. In their <a href="https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/85658-Existing-Accounts-Steam/" target="_blank">original announcement</a> on that, they said it was due to microtransactions needing to use Steam services, and they didn't want Steam to force taking an extra cut on it as they would lose revenue from existing users who moved over. That is still the case today, as installing and running on Steam it tells you clearly you have to make a new account.</p>
<p>Do you think Albion Online is a title you might play on Deck?</p>

      <title>Wine 7.3 is out, more Joystick fixes and PE conversion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More work has been done on the Windows compatibility layer Wine in development <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.3" target="_blank">version 7.3</a> that's out now.</p>
<p>This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Release highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More large scale cleanups to support 'long' type.</li>
<li>Proper support for API sets.</li>
<li>Progress on the PE conversion of USER32 and WineALSA.</li>
<li>A number of HID joystick fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As we explained previously: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>For bug fixes as of this release they mentioned 15 solved helping games like Gray Matter, Black and White 2, Trails to Azure and a few miscellaneous fixes.</p>

      <title>Aperture Desk Job from Valve coming March 1 and it&#39;s free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Along with the release of the Steam Deck, Valve also announce a new upcoming game in the Portal universe named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/" target="_blank">Aperture Desk Job</a> that will release March 1. To keep expectations in check, it's not Portal 3 or even close to it but it does expand the universe.</p>
<p>It's basically a mini-game to celebrate the Steam Deck release, and it will require a gamepad to play too. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="deztqxyhz7c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9de0f15288bfe9ff55e77b76ad6d2b4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/deztqxyhz7c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Aperture Desk Job reimagines the been-there-done-that genre of walking simulators and puts them in the lightning-spanked, endorphin-gorged world of sitting still behind things.</p>
<p>You play as an entry-level nobody on their first day at work — your heart full of hope and your legs full of dreams, eager to climb that corporate ladder. But life’s got other plans, and they all involve chairs.</p>
<p>Designed as a free playable short for Valve’s new Steam Deck, Desk Job walks you through the handheld’s controls and features, while not being nearly as boring as that sounds."</p>
<p><em>I will be checking it out at release of course.</em></p>
<p>Valve also included a joke to Hollywood about making a film with a funny email address on the Steam store page.</p>

      <title>Valve explains more shipping details for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Curious to know when exactly you'll get a Steam Deck? A lot of people asked and so Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3113680716504852534" target="_blank">has given</a> a little more info. While the Steam Deck has now released, it could still be a little while before you get your hands on a unit even if you're in the Q1 slot.</p>
<p>As a reminder: when Valve send you an email to invite you to actually make the purchase, you have 72 hours to go through with it or you entirely lose your place and it goes to the next person.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All people who are in the Q1 reservation window on the Steam Deck store page will receive an order email by the end of March. (Q1 is Quarter 1, or January through March).</li>
<li>The first batch of emails has already gone out this morning.</li>
<li>The next batch of emails will go out on Monday, March 7th. (It turns out the logistics work out better if we don’t try to ship over a weekend.)</li>
<li>We’ll continue sending emails to Q1 reservers in the order their reservations were made on a weekly basis through the end of March (March 14th, 21st, 28th)</li>
<li>In April, we’ll start going through the Q2 queue in a similar fashion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of you who have a date of sometime after Q2, Valve said to expect more news on that "soon".</p>
<p>My own personal unit of the top-end model is in the Q1 slot, so I'll be able to make some proper comparisons on the screen quality between the models eventually for you. Valve did email out this morning to confirm my review unit is for keeps, so expect a lot more regular Steam Deck content from me.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck desktop mode plus other stores — Epic Games Store</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have your shiny new Steam Deck, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">I’ve gone over in an initial look</a> on — but what about desktop mode apps and other stores? I’ve also been testing that with the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck comes with a full desktop mode too outside of the Steam UI. The desktop environment is<a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/" target="_blank"> KDE Plasma</a> (my own favourite Linux desktop) and so people familiar with Windows should feel quite at home. A perfect choice in this reviewer's opinion. You also do <em>not</em> need developer mode to access it. You just hit the <em>Steam</em> menu, select <em>Power</em> and then <em>Switch to Desktop</em>. To get back to Deck UI, you just <em>Log Off</em> from the Plasma menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21140738581645799096gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21140738581645799096gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>One thing I will mention is that the SteamOS version of Plasma is somewhat minimal, and doesn’t include a huge amount of software — which is, of course, a space saving measure. Valve has to ensure everything fits on the lowest end model which only has 64GB space and a little room is left needed for both a few games and operating system updates to go smoothly.</p>
<p>For testing the desktop mode, I’ve been using a pretty generic £20 USB-C HUB with power delivery so it can keep the Deck powered too (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> - Brand: Paonies, although mine came etched as LEVIN). It’s cheap, cheerful and does the job splendidly. Just connect the HUB to the USB-C port on the top of the Deck, plug in a HDMI wire between your monitor and the HUB and pop — you’re now playing on a bigger screen. This works for both desktop mode and Deck UI mode.</p>
<p>Currently though, there’s a bit of a quirk here. Hooking up your HDMI-out to a monitor for desktop mode will add it as a second screen, instead of cloning the Deck screen like it does for the main Deck UI. If you tell Plasma to clone it, this brings up a bug in Plasma where your main bottom panel will disappear. A workaround I found for now is to first set your external screen to the Deck resolution at 1280x800, and <em>then</em> tell it to clone it. From there, it works.</p>
<p><u>Tip</u>: if you’re in need of a wireless keyboard to mess with Steam Deck Desktop Mode, I can <em>highly</em> recommend the<a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/k400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.html" target="_blank"> Logitech K400 Plus</a>. I’ve used it for over a year, with it being plug and play on Linux and so the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>The SteamOS file system comes out of the box as read-only, so you will <em>not</em> be able to install standard Arch Linux packages easily. If you wish to have full root filesystem access, Valve has <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> on that and more. It's a quick terminal command with sudo. That’s not something I’ll recommend, unless you truly know what you’re doing — no one wants to break their Deck. However, there’s plenty of extra software you <em>can</em> install quite easily using the app called <u>Discover</u> as it comes with Flathub / Flatpak installed and set up in a way that won’t mess with anything. The amount of software available will increase over time too; developers just need to put their stuff up on<a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank"> Flathub</a>. Some of what you can install easily includes Chromium (Firefox is the default — although Chrome has an easy install in the Deck UI), Discord, Telegram, Blender, Godot Engine, Krita, GIMP, VLC, Inkscape and a great many others.</p>
<p>You can also use AppImages and anything else that’s a standalone Linux download.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7101541491645799678gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7101541491645799678gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2714318781645799679gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2714318781645799679gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Something I got asked to show, so here you go:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7612172091645645259gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7612172091645645259gol1.png"/></a><br/>
Do you even Linux if you don’t Neofetch?</em></p>
<p>For now, desktop mode is the main way to install third-party applications. Using Discord as an example, if that’s your preferred way to chat to friends online, you can jump into desktop mode and then add it to Steam to show up in Deck UI mode. Same process as on a normal desktop: add it as a non-Steam game.</p>
<p>You can have multiple things open and switch between them too in Deck UI mode once you’ve added them. Simply tap the Steam button, go back Home / Library and then launch something else. When you hit the Steam button again, what’s already open will be listed at the top of the Steam menu.</p>
<p>Here’s a short look at installing and using Discord on Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MffgyYPFov4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97b4552ff9bc8a820cf5c215691c6375.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MffgyYPFov4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those curious on the audio server, the Steam Deck is clearly using <strong>Pipewire</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3619452411645645396gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3619452411645645396gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently, it seems desktop mode is still X11 and not Wayland.</p>
<p>For those interested to know what speed you could be potentially looking at for the wireless with a pretty basic Google WiFi setup, using tests in desktop mode from a few different sources I averaged about 148 Mbps down / 15 Mbps up. So the wireless inside the Deck is pretty good overall. I’ve also tested tethering to my phone as a hotspot, which worked without issues as well.</p>
<p><strong>Other stores? Say hello to Epic Games</strong><br/>
<em>Time to raise some eyebrows.</em></p>
<p>While this is a Valve Software machine, a <em>Steam</em> Deck — that doesn’t mean it’s locked down to the Steam store. This is where things get a little bit more complicated, however. Neither GOG or Epic Games have official Linux support for their store applications. With the Steam Deck shipping with SteamOS 3 Linux, that’s a potential problem for some users.</p>
<p>However, there’s some good news there as well — the community provides! For anything non-Steam, you do need to go into the desktop mode.</p>
<p>For Epic Games (and GOG in their latest release) you can use the<a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank"> Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a caveat here though: for gamepad input to work on the Deck directly, anything you run needs to be added to Steam directly as a non-Steam game as it needs Steam Input. This is true of any game. For Heroic, that's not currently possible due to various issues — so you'll need either an external gamepad or keyboard. </p>
<p>I also tried the<a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank"> Lutris</a> launcher that supports <em>many</em> stores, but it currently doesn't work out of the box on the Steam Deck but it <em>should</em> be fixed in the next main release. You could likely get around both issues with developer mode turned on, to get access to the full filesystem to install either Lutris or Heroic using standard Arch Linux packages — but that’s not something I'll ever recommend on the Steam Deck. Ideally, we need them both to have a Flatpak package to make it simpler.</p>
<p>So right now, the situation for external stores is a little on the rough side, at least when it comes to unofficial native launchers.</p>
<p>Guess what though? You <strong>can</strong> use the <em>Windows</em> version of the Epic Games Store, directly on the Steam Deck. If you add the <em>installer</em> as a non-Steam game. Here’s a step by step process:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/" target="_blank">Download</a> the EGS installer.</li>
<li>Add the EGS installer as a non-Steam game either by: 
	<ol>
<li>Clicking “Add A Game” on the bottom left of the Steam client -&gt; “Add a Non-Steam Game” -&gt; navigate to the Downloads folder and pick the EGS msi file.</li>
<li>Clicking Games in the top menu, then click “Add a Non-Steam Game to my Library” -&gt; navigate to the Downloads folder and pick the EGS msi file.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Right click the new entry -&gt; Properties -&gt; Force Proton 7.0 in the Compatibility menu.</li>
<li>Run it, let it install and it will just exit the installer when done.</li>
<li>Adjust your non-Steam shortcut, to point to the newly installed EGS EXE file. Again by right click -&gt; Properties and then adjust the paths. You should find the EGS launcher somewhere like: "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/*randomnumber*/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/Launcher/Portal/Binaries/Win32/EpicGamesLauncher.exe"<br/>
<em>Where *randomnumber* is an ID generated by Steam, that’s different each time as it’s a game / app not actually on Steam so it makes a new unique one. It will be a high number, so it’s not hard to find.</em></li>
<li>Run it and watch the magic</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Even better, here’s a video of it in action:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UvuGAQDagWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e927b86122e244cab965b7e0f0e07b0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UvuGAQDagWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Considering all those free games I have on the Epic Store, this might even get me to play some of them…</p>
<p>To be clear though, this does <strong>not</strong> make games with Anti-Cheat work. Just like using plain Steam, developers need to update and test their games. Really, putting their games on Steam is absolutely still the best way to play them on the Steam Deck of course but having options is great.</p>

      <title>The Steam Deck has released, here&#39;s my initial review</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675180/announcements/detail/3113680716502086761" target="_blank">arrived</a> and Valve were kind enough to ship GamingOnLinux a review unit — here’s my own initial thoughts after spending a couple weeks with it. <u>See also</u>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">desktop mode, Discord and the Epic Store</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>You're witnessing history in the making, Valve's secret weapon to not be attached to Windows.</em></p>
<p>What is it? If you somehow don’t know already: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">the Steam Deck</a> is a brand new Linux-powered handheld gaming PC from Valve Corporation that was released officially today, February 25th, with the first deliveries going out around February 28. Valve will be sending out weekly purchasing invites for those who put in a reservation.</p>
<p><em>Most article images can be made bigger, give ‘em a click!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888961581645561687gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888961581645561687gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The Steam Deck comes in three different models:</p>
<ul>
<li>64GB eMMC</li>
<li>256GB NVMe SSD</li>
<li>512GB NVMe SSD + anti-glare screen</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Model tested</u>: 256 GB (the middle one)</p>
<p>For testing it myself, the challenge was pretty simple: from the time I received it until the release of this article — every possible bit of gaming (where it made sense) would be done on it to ensure thorough testing. So this is the result of my initial time with it and I’ll have plenty <em>more</em> to say across future articles and videos. Valve did <em>not</em> give any requirements or have any expectations to follow, it’s all me.</p>
<p>To get something clear: I'm just a massive Linux nerd with a glorified blog, I don’t have the kind of vast resources of LinusTechTips and other well-known stars. I’m much closer to your average consumer, so this is just my honest lowbrow experience and initial thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>The launch lineup</strong></p>
<p>Clearly the best launch lineup of any “console-like” platform ever isn’t it? There might never again be a launch that’s as good as this, except perhaps a future Valve system. It is a little different here, though, as there’s a few categories of compatibility unlike traditional consoles. Here you have (as of publishing time):</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified (430)</li>
<li>Playable (399)</li>
<li>Unsupported (389)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those numbers <em>will</em> change over time too, and we fully expect compatibility to <em>continue</em> improving quite quickly. In the mix are native Linux games, and lots of Windows games that run through the<a href="https://www.steamproton.com" target="_blank"> Proton</a> compatibility layer — which is seriously impressive.</p>
<p><u>Info</u>: just because a game is not listed as either Verified or Playable, doesn’t mean it won’t work. It just means it hasn’t yet been through official testing. You might find a lot of games “just work”.</p>
<p>One big problem that remains are games which use Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye. Although they support Linux and Proton with the Steam Deck, developers still need to manually enable them. And <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/epic-games-ceo-says-a-clear-no-to-fortnite-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">don’t expect Fortnite</a> to ever be compatible. This still very much feels like the Deck’s Achilles’ heel.</p>
<p><u>Disclaimer</u>: much like regular Steam, Valve works on the software a lot — and often pretty quickly too. Expect to see rapid changes to all parts of it, so you <em>could</em> see some differences in our videos / pictures. We expect results on all kinds of tests to be up and down for a while.</p>
<p>For scale, here's an ASUS Vivobook S15 (15.6" laptop). Gives you an interesting perspective on the size vs portability discussion that a lot of people have been having.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19949204021645565610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19949204021645565610gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even better — here's the Original Switch (top), OLED Switch and Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14125677401645561830gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14125677401645561830gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>How does it feel then? That’s what you all want to know, right? Well, I have a <em>slightly</em> different perspective and focus than other reviewers I think for two reasons. Let’s get into that and allow me to explain why.</p>
<p><strong>Ergonomics</strong></p>
<p>I have a <em>confession</em> to make and one that worried me about the Steam Deck. I have truly <em>tiny</em> hands for an adult and the Steam Deck is…hilariously chunky at first glance. That’s being kind; it’s an absolute <em><u>beast</u></em> of a unit. It’s so big that it was something of a shock when opening the box for the first time.</p>
<p>Then I picked it up and it’s a bit like — oh, there’s really not much to it. The actual feel of the weight in-hand was probably the biggest surprise as it’s not just lighter than expected but the weight distribution feels nicely even too. As soon as I grip the sides, it’s a bit like my hands melt into the unit and it’s genuinely comfortable right away.</p>
<p>Obligatory shot of me holding it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19441139471645561858gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19441139471645561858gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For reference, the hands of a 10 year old:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14285595931645562107gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14285595931645562107gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>How does it compare to a Nintendo Switch? Since I own one I can safely tell you that, without a doubt, I vastly prefer holding the Steam Deck. I think the Switch is actually completely terrible to hold. The Switch is just too thin with your hands clamped awkwardly around the sides, this is the direct opposite.</p>
<p>Another unique point for my testing is due to a permanent injury. My right hand has a bone with a nice big circular hole in it (that was a fun MRI), one that can get quite painful and so this has been a serious test of just how comfortable it would be for longer gaming sessions. Not just because I have to keep holding onto the Deck but also I have to move fingers and thumbs around constantly.</p>
<p>Getting around 2 hours in without a break and it’s still <em>mostly</em> comfortable. I say mostly because after 2 hours I do start to feel the weight. I do feel a slight bit of hand ache but that goes away after a 5 minute break. Then I cosy back up with it and carry on. I don’t really consider it a big issue at all.</p>
<p>Really, the ergonomics have impressed me constantly. I went in nervous, thinking it would cause a real nuisance due to all the comments about the size, but came away massively impressed with the positioning of everything. No issues reaching any button at all. The shoulder buttons, too, are great, as you only need to tap the <em>corners</em> to use them (no need to stretch right on top) — I’ve often had problems with that on other gamepads. If it’s not an issue for me, it likely won’t be for the vast majority.</p>
<p>The feel of the device is not <em>all</em> perfection, though. There’s two sore spots: the dedicated Steam and Quick Access buttons. They feel really off compared to the rest of the device. They don’t really push in; they feel like they only need a light touch but you do need to push and they just don’t feel good to use. You use them quite a lot which makes the issue stick out. They’re a weird contrast to every other button, pad and stick because all other parts feel <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>
<p>What’s also incredibly useful are all the keybinds setup, which you can view by holding down the Quick Access menu:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20879304251645640893gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20879304251645640893gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On the subject of comfort, what about the heat after gaming for a few hours? How does it feel to keep going? Well, that’s an interesting one. The Steam Deck does get pretty darn warm, although this is again something Valve clearly prepared for. The design of the shell along with the airflow is excellent. The heat stays towards the middle where the fan is blowing from the top, plus the Deck is designed so where you’re gripping always stays nice and cool. When you put the Deck down on a surface, the grips hold it safely above ground to keep the airflow.</p>
<p>For actual gaming though, the Deck feels marvellous. When it comes to flicking around thumbsticks, I personally find (you may disagree of course) that Microsoft has pretty much the gold standard for feel with the Xbox Controller. The Steam Deck thumbsticks feel very close to the latest generation of the Xbox Controller, with just the right amount of pullback to the centre, so they feel <em>really</em> smooth to play with. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18792021361645562177gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18792021361645562177gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>That’s an Xbox Controller sitting in the background. Don’t ask why, it just looked cool.</em></p>
<p>Thinking about the overall quality of the Steam Deck, that’s something we can’t honestly answer without a <em>much</em> longer time with it. However, <em>for now</em> I can tell you it feels rock solid and sturdy. Compared with the Valve Index and Steam Controller, which I’ve used both extensively — I think the build is actually a lot better for the Deck.</p>
<p><strong>It's a LINUX system. I know this.</strong></p>
<p>It’s Linux! But <em>not</em> as you know it to be. SteamOS 3 is <em>based-on</em> Arch Linux, so it uses the packaging system of Arch Linux behind the scenes but with Valve handling all the updates and configuration for you. The default, of course, is the brand shiny new Steam UI for the Deck which will eventually replace Big Picture Mode on desktop as well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cyk8pD2x1ew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8161cf848e27e03353ce9b77c5652bf4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cyk8pD2x1ew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Is the Deck the biggest thing to happen in the Linux gaming space ever? People comfortable with Windows still didn’t have much reason to interact with Linux and this puts Linux directly into the hands of a massive amount more people. Things like Linux being free, open source, privacy respecting and the like are great but now there’s a <u>good</u> <em>dedicated</em> Linux gaming device! This new set of users will be using Linux and perhaps even without really realising it.</p>
<p>That’s probably the biggest point here: you don’t even need to know it uses Linux. Valve has carefully tailored the experience to do exactly what they want. Once people already like it, the “Linux talk” becomes that much easier and perhaps, as a byproduct, more may want to try it on their desktop or laptop — I think the Steam Deck will have a number of knock-on effects elsewhere like this.</p>

<p>Actually finding something to play is pretty easy if you have an existing collection of games. The Library page has a dedicated “Great on Deck” tab. So right away you’re presented with a list of titles that have been officially Verified by Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16282778171645638275gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16282778171645638275gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not just that, there’s also a filter you can apply to your Steam Library to swap between: Verified; Verified and Playable; Verified, Playable Untested; All Games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/64428221645638379gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/64428221645638379gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve has also added a very helpful additional section to the Library, where you will find Non-Steam applications. It seems Valve will gradually build this up, as an easy way to install and launch additional software. Right now, Chrome is the installer listed so you can easily get a browser sorted in Deck UI mode without touching the desktop mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16638091601645700119gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16638091601645700119gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For those curious on how the Steam Deck UI will show if a game is running a native Linux build or Proton, here's how. For native games, the Game Info tab on the Library will not really say anything but for Windows builds in Proton it will say it runs via Steam Play Proton and the version picked by either Valve or what you’ve forced it to use. Examples:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4247755551645641313gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4247755551645641313gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see no mention of Proton above, showing that it’s running a version built for Linux. Although, <em>some</em> might specifically say they’re running the Steam Linux Runtime.</p>
<p>Whereas Noita below, is clearly running the Windows version via Proton as it says below the compatibility mark:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8164619181645641406gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8164619181645641406gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For those curious on how Valve tests for native or Proton, Valve has updated their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/compat#7" target="_blank">developer documentation</a> (we covered it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/valve-clarifies-how-they-test-native-linux-or-proton-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">previous article</a>) to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, we will test a Linux build if one is available. If the Linux build fails compatibility tests or otherwise experiences significant issues, we'll then test the Windows build of your game running under Proton. Our goal is for customers to have the smoothest experience possible on Deck, so we'll submit whichever set of test results is more favourable.</p>
<p>Your compatibility test results will specify what runtime they were generated on. You can see details in the "Details" section of your report under the "Recommended Runtime" field.</p>
<p>If you believe we tested the wrong version of your product, you can always submit for a re-review and specify the platform you'd like us to test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also easily find new games to buy for the Deck, as the store has a dedicated start page. Naturally, all games shown on the Deck store area will need to have passed verification — so it's another little kick for developers to get their games into a good state for things like gamepad support and text clarity to ensure they actually show up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5106544201645638047gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5106544201645638047gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The whole Steam store is available as well, so you can search for anything.</p>
<p>What happens if you try to buy a game that doesn't have verification for the Steam Deck? Valve puts up a very clear warning in the shopping cart that explains the situation. You really can't miss it but they also won't block you buying so you can still do whatever you want of course. It's your device — do what you want but Valve will guide you in places.</p>
<p><strong>Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>Naturally, Valve went through a lot of different possible designs. Just like with the Steam Controller, some were quite different. Here’s a shot of some of what we could have seen:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20445177021645206944gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20445177021645206944gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><strong>How about the Docking Station?</strong></p>
<p>We have shots of that too for you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4608055041645206942gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4608055041645206942gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20873884241645206943gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20873884241645206943gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Valve said the Deck Dock will be available “late spring”.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmarks</strong></p>
<p>It’s all well and good talking about it, showing some shots and doing explainers but you want to know how well it performs, right? Thankfully it’s actually really easy to test performance. SteamOS 3 on Deck uses <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>, a micro-compositor that’s a massive evolution over what SteamOS 2 used and it comes with a whole bag of tricks.</p>
<p>One of these tricks is the direct inclusion of the <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> Overlay, with multiple preset levels of data output. From basic FPS tracking to VRAM and per-core utilisation. It’s a fantastic thing to have set up and ready out of the box. It’s an absolute dream for tech-nerds. All you need to do to enable it is hit the Quick Access button, go to the Performance section (the Battery icon) and then adjust the Performance Overlay Level.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks on level 1 and level 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14618831731645643314gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14618831731645643314gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21157789581645643312gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21157789581645643312gol1.jpg"/></a>Top left is MangoHud.

<p>Enough chat, time to show some preliminary performance numbers.</p>

<p>Something that will no doubt confuse a few people: the HZD benchmark lists the Operating System version. Since this is a Windows game running through Proton, it will say it’s Windows when it’s <em>not</em>. Just to be clear.</p>

<p><u>Note</u>: After an OS update, Valve now force-locks the Deck to 60FPS max, with a single toggle to bring it down to 30FPS. Previously there was no upper limit. The below benchmarks were done after this was added.</p>

<p>Valve said they were aiming for games at a minimum to hit 30FPS for their testing. Clearly the Deck can handle quite a lot — at least at its native resolution of 1280x800. The performance isn’t going to blow away people who go buying an NVIDIA 3080 and squeeze every last drop, but there’s no denying what this <em><u>handheld</u></em> can do is pretty surprising on performance level.</p>
<p>Deck…<em>Verified</em>? For Horizon Zero Dawn being a Deck Verified title as a first example, the default settings perform on the poor side. While benchmarks may look okay they <em>never</em> truly tell the gameplay feel. This is why I think people often put too much faith into them. Playing this Deck Verified title myself for many hours, the default settings had lots of repeating lows and stuttering (it was the same even on lower settings). It felt generally okay and hit the 30FPS mark for a fair bit of the open world but with stutter for new areas and hard drops for some battles. </p>
<p>I had the same issues with Borderland 3 (that’s only Deck “Playable” - but Playable titles should still perform well). Devil May Cry 5, another Verified title, seems to perform great but the cutscene audio goes constantly out of sync which is seriously distracting, Vampyr just doesn't launch and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand some games are actually <em>smoother</em> than on my PC. God of War for example <em>works</em> on my main Arch Linux PC but NVIDIA drivers have issues while on Deck it felt better and remained smooth even during big fights.</p>
<p>Really, I just hope that Valve hasn’t bitten off more than they can chew to <u>accurately</u> verify the multiple tens of thousands that make up the Steam store. I think it’s going to take time for Valve to truly get Deck Verified right — especially when the majority of games are <em>not</em> made for the Deck. A <em>solvable</em> problem though, some of which will need the game developer to optimise for and more of an early adopter issue I would put it down to for now.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject of Deck Verified, one point that I've seen across quite a few games is a note about how they don't default to external controllers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13726925681645787861gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13726925681645787861gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> usually a big deal at all as the Steam Deck gives you a built-in ability to rearrange controller order. All you do is load into the game, press the Quick Access button and the Quick Settings section when you scroll down has a "Rearrange controller order" button.</p>
<p>It's super easy to change too, on the screen below all you need to do is tap one controller and then place it where you want it. No fuss at all, it's absolutely brilliant. Tested working great switching between the Deck and an Xbox Controller with Elden Ring.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1136404611645787910gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1136404611645787910gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An extra quirk / bug I've come across here has me a bit puzzled. My latest-gen (Series X) Xbox Controller works perfectly using a simple USB-C to USB-A adapter to plug it directly into the Deck but it does <em>not</em> work if the controller is plugged into my USB-C hub. However, my knock-off Amazon Xbox controller works with both — eh? Confusing and a little annoying to be sure.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Bluetooth to the rescue! Testing two different Xbox controllers, both sync up just fine and input with them is great. A note though — you will need to make sure you have the latest controller firmware, otherwise the Bluetooth connection will not work.</p>
<p>How about a little gameplay captured from the Deck of Elden Ring? You got it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GrT2Ebonc1k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a57beb915e10c92455834ef23f8d9e4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GrT2Ebonc1k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Loading times</strong></p>
<p>In-built storage versus an SD Card is another interesting one to benchmark. For my own main testing and installing games I picked a SanDisk Extreme 1 TB, and timed from pressing play to getting in-game where you can do anything (past any main menu). The results are surprising. This majority was done without skipping anything, so usually intro videos are left to play and then loaded into the same savepoint each time (or closest possible point).</p>
<p><u>Borderlands 3</u> built-in storage: 2:49<br/>
<u>Borderlands 3</u> SD card: 3:24</p>
<p><u>Dead Cells</u> built-in storage: 24s<br/>
<u>Dead Cells</u> SD card: 19s</p>
<p><u>Deathloop</u> built-in storage: 3:14<br/>
<u>Deathloop</u> SD Card: 3:38</p>
<p><u>Death Stranding</u> built-in storage: 30s<br/>
<u>Death Stranding</u> SD Card: 1:37</p>
<p><u>DOOM (2016)</u> built-in storage: 1:10<br/>
<u>DOOM (2016)</u> SD Card: 1:27</p>
<p><u>God of War</u> built-in storage: 1:03<br/>
<u>God of War</u> SD Card: 1:14</p>
<p><u>Horizon Zero Dawn</u> built-in storage: 1:00<br/>
<u>Horizon Zero Dawn</u> SD Card: 1:32</p>
<p><u>No Man’s Sky</u> built-in storage: 1:26<br/>
<u>No Man’s Sky</u> SD Card: 1:43</p>
<p><u>Shadow Warrior</u> built-in storage: 50s<br/>
<u>Shadow Warrior</u> SD Card: 48s</p>
<p>Naturally all tests were re-run and verified. Hopefully that assortment of games gives you an idea on waiting times for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Realistically then, it’s pretty clear that loading times from a good SD Card are reasonable. No real complaints from me there. This makes the low-end model of the Steam Deck a pretty good option overall if you have a nice sized SD Card to stick inside.</p>
<p><strong>Audio quality</strong></p>
<p>I won’t spend long on this point because there’s really not a whole lot to say. The speakers are excellent. At no point have I wanted to hook up a headset, because the quality they produce is supremely clear even when running intense games and the fan is blowing a bit; everything remains crystal clear.</p>
<p>Connecting up a pair of JLab Bluetooth earbuds was also without issue. Turn them on, turn Bluetooth on the Deck and watch as it enters the list. Tap it on Deck and you’re connected. Absolutely zero problems there. Nothing to write home about the audio jack either, plugging in a few different pairs of older wired sets laying around and they all work great. Steam Chat worked nicely with all headsets tested.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick completely unfiltered audio sample captured from Steam Chat, using the built-in microphone from the Steam Deck at full and then half volume:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">
<audio controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8865266961645562334gol1.mp3"> </audio>
</div>
<p>Voice quality is really <em>not</em> amazing but it’s good enough. If you set it to just less than two-thirds full, you get reasonable clarity and volume without distorting like it does a bit at max input. This is pretty much expected given how tiny it is.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life and tweaking</strong></p>
<p>The Steam Deck is portable and one of the most important aspects there is battery life. How long will the juice hold up while playing some of your favourites? Well, it’s a very tough question to answer because for the Steam Deck, there’s no real standard here — and others testing will have their own special way. Also unlike other portables, on the Steam Deck you get the full-fat version of each game (be it a native Linux game or a Windows build run through Steam Play Proton).</p>
<p>What Valve claims with the official specs is anywhere between 2–8 hours, and that depends on a huge variety of factors like volume and brightness levels, FPS, per-game power-draw and more. Valve’s own testing sticks to 30FPS with 50% for both volume and brightness.</p>
<p>Valve does have a few newer bits available in the Steam API for developers to be able to do some Deck tweaks. They can see if you’re running the game on Deck, and have some parts pre-configured like the default graphical settings. We expect many more developers to use this <em>but</em> until they do, messing around with settings just like on a PC is quite often a must to prevent runaway battery drain. Ensuring no matter what that you’ve forced an upper limit of 60FPS is practically essential. There’s absolutely no need to have it higher on this handheld. Really though, if you want even semi-reasonable battery life, for modern games it <em>will</em> be 30FPS you’re looking at.</p>
<p>With brightness at 50%, audio at 50% and no other special tweaks done here's some of what I saw across various different types of tests.</p>
<p><u>Borderlands 3</u> (Low Preset):</p>
<ol>
<li>60 FPS limit: lasted 1.40 hours</li>
<li>30 FPS limit: lasted 3.10 hours</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The HUD showed wattage go from 11–14w (30FPS) to about 23–24w (60FPS)</em></p>
<p><u>Horizon Zero Dawn</u> (default “Original” settings)</p>
<ol>
<li>60FPS limit: lasted 1.30 hours</li>
<li>30FPS limit: lasted 1.50 hours</li>
</ol>
<p><em>HUD showed it using from 21–25w in each mode. Both wattage and battery life wasn’t much different here between the two but with 60FPS sticking more towards the 25w mark, as on default settings it struggled to stay above 40FPS.</em></p>
<p><u>Noita</u> (default settings - 60FPS): lasted 4.40 hours<br/>
<em>30FPS made it too sluggish to play. HUD showed wattage about 12–14w (60FPS).</em></p>
<p><u>Vampire Survivors</u> (defaults, 60FPS): lasted 5.10 hours.<br/>
<em>30FPS made it too sluggish to play. This game in particular can have huge performance issues at the end of each level on the Steam Deck due to the amount going on. HUD showed wattage around 7–8w (60FPS).</em></p>
<p><u>World War Z Aftermath</u> (Low settings)</p>
<ol>
<li>60 FPS limit: lasted 2.15 hours</li>
<li>30 FPS limit: lasted 4.10 hours</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Curiously, locking to 30FPS in World War Z shows up an annoying bug, holding Y to switch to a heavy weapon will sometimes crash the game, which never happens in 60FPS mode. The HUD shows wattage go from 8–9w (30FPS) to around 13w (60FPS).</em></p>
<p>Video playback is a hot topic and a pretty fun measure of how the battery charge holds up. Playing a 720p <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDfjXj5EGqI" target="_blank">YouTube Video</a> full-screen starting from full charge, with 50% volume and 50% brightness in desktop mode managed a pretty decent 6 hours.</p>
<p>In a rather unprecedented move for such a device, you’ve got a few power options to adjust if you really want to try hitting some kind of performance to battery life sweet spot. This is thanks to it being Linux-powered, so Valve can hook into whatever they want. This isn’t BIOS-level stuff either, the Quick Access menu just gives it to you. This includes AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) built right into it!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17314257501645781743gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17314257501645781743gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You get access to flick the FPS down to 30, which by itself isn't overly fancy. Plenty of games nowadays have some form of VSync and a lot also now let you limit the framerate too. What you get here is the ability to limit the processor power from 3–15w, and change the GPU clock frequency from 200–1600. Each is available via a toggle that then opens up a slider to adjust to whatever level you want to set.</p>
<p>The aim is all about maximising battery life. You might be able to bring both down a bit, while still hitting 30FPS in some games to give some extra gaming time. It's part of what honestly makes this one of the geekiest devices I've ever had the pleasure of testing. Once a community builds up around the device, I've no doubt that all sorts of suggested presets will appear to extend battery life.</p>
<p>How about the Suspend Mode? How good is that at keeping the Steam Deck alive for another run? Running from 100% charge with it being set into suspend untouched for <u>24</u> hours put it down to <u>91%</u> charge. Going further on suspend to <u>36</u> hours saw the battery hit <u>86%</u> charge.</p>
<p>It’s pretty safe to say if you leave it on suspend, forget to put it on charge and go to work and come back hoping to pick up and play — you’re in pretty good hands.</p>
<p>Turning back on from suspend is lightning fast too, less than 3 seconds to be on my Steam Library and fully usable. To see the difference when it’s suspended while playing a game, bringing back Dead Cells after suspend took about the same time, just less than 3 seconds. Not an intensive game though by any measure, so how about God of War? From suspended to playable it was a mere 3 seconds. Suspend mode on the Steam Deck is simply <em>insane</em> for its speed.</p>
<p>What I’ve seen is that the Deck <em>can</em> charge up quite quickly, and it will do so up to around the 80% mark in little over an hour. After that, it slows down to protect the life of the battery. Through testing multiple times over multiple days, the total time to charge while on but the system idling each time, I saw it usually take between 2–3 hours (most of the time closer to 3). Additionally, sometimes the Deck may report <em>less</em> than a 100% charge as full, Valve explained over email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your device has been left on the charger for long periods of time, it may report less than 100% when taking it off the charger. This is normal – we allow the battery to slowly discharge after long periods of time under charge to optimize long-term battery health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I find that decision a bit peculiar and will lead to confusion for users unless it’s very carefully and clearly noted.</p>
<p><u>Tip</u>: interested in a charger that works well with the Steam Deck? Having more than one is probably a good idea! I’ve also thoroughly tested the Spigen ArcStation Pro USB C 45W Charger (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0998Y231K/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>). It gives plenty of juice for the Deck to get good charging times.</p>
<p>While keeping in mind their testing volume and brightness level, I think it will be very rare for you to see the 8 hours Valve mentioned. Personally, I think they’ve been a bit too ambitious with their marketing on that, as you will rarely see it outside of pretty basic games (or quite a bit of tweaking).</p>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<p>Just like the main Steam client, the Steam Deck also supports Remote Play. This means you can use it as a streaming device. Enabling you to play games relaxing on your sofa with your Deck in-hand but with perhaps a rather heavy game being streamed from your PC.</p>
<p>In my own testing, over WiFi the experience was <em>not</em> great. This will heavily depend on what kind of WiFi setup you have but I would definitely recommend some sort of Ethernet adapter here for the best experience. I have some equipment on the way to aid testing of this that sadly got repeatedly delayed, so a more thorough write-up on Remote Play will come.</p>
<p><strong>SD Card Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Want to prepare some SD Cards ready for the Steam Deck? It’s actually quite easy.</p>
<p>They’re formatted to <em>ext4</em>, and they use the exact same layout as Steam Library folders as the Linux desktop client. So, as a test, I simply copied over a Steam Library from my laptop. Specifically, it needs to be the whole “steamapps” folder which by default would be somewhere like:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code"><em>~/.steam/steam/steamapps/</em></code></p>
<p>After placing that directly onto a freshly formatted SD Card, I popped it into the Steam Deck and — pop, there’s the games. This was tested a few times, with Windows games that used Proton and native Linux builds.</p>
<p>On initial insert, Steam creates a “libraryfolder.vdf” file to identify it. If it doesn’t detect the games right away, I found that pulling out the SD Card and popping it back in does the job.</p>
<p><strong>The fun factor</strong></p>
<p>This article has been over lots of “stuff and things” so far but here’s another vital measure: is the Steam Deck actually <em>fun</em> to use and play games on? You bet it is.</p>
<p>In a few ways the Steam Deck came to me a bit too fresh out of the oven. There were quite a number of frustrations during testing, but Valve has been honestly toiling away to fix any I mentioned to them. That said — I can’t even begin to properly explain the amount of happiness I’ve had being able to play the likes of Borderlands 3, Death Stranding, HITMAN 3, Into the Breach, No Man’s Sky, World War Z and more while sitting in bed after a long day. Honestly, it’s pure joy. It feels liberating not having to stay at my desk to play some favourites. The Steam Deck will absolutely get me to play more games, that’s something I now just consider a fact.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9247468541645787372gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9247468541645787372gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Game pictures - No Man's Sky</em></p>
<p>Often I thought that the Steam Deck would allow me to get through my backlog of titles on Steam. I had these grand plans of camping out on the sofa, diving into my vast list of unplayed or unfinished titles. You know what though? It’s only going to make it <em>worse</em> and grow bigger because of how good it is.</p>
<p>I now have previously PlayStation exclusives like God of War running on Linux handheld! How absolutely amazing is that? Being honest though, it came horribly close to becoming a dedicated Vampire Survivors machine — gosh that game is just far too absorbing. I need another run, <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18107440351645562696gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18107440351645562696gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>I actually beat a Vampire Survivors map playing on Steam Deck, I feel accomplished.</em></p>
<p>Personally, I’ve <em>not</em> enjoyed testing out the Gyro. I always end up feeling like I’m fighting it for where I want to aim. That’s just me though. I know there’s plenty of people who <em>adore</em> Gyro — but I think it needs quite some setup to get to a place where it’s enjoyable to use and I just couldn’t get there. Same for Trackpad aiming in anything first-person — it’s just not for me and that’s <em>okay</em>. </p>
<p>The point is, the Steam Deck comes with vast input options that should be suitable for most types of gamers. I really love the thumbsticks, some of the best I’ve ever used and I am very happy with using just them — but the option of having Gyro and Trackpad is great for others.</p>
<p>What about titles that aren’t in any way designed for a gamepad, like classic RTS games?</p>
<p>For this I initially tried out the Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection. It works out of the box on the Steam Deck and looks pretty great too. Performance isn’t an issue and even text sizing and clarity seems pretty great. It’s somewhat playable but, realistically, this one is a bit too on the classic side to feel good on the Steam Deck. There’s lots of hotkeys and Steam Input does <em>not</em> work well with it on Deck — plenty of buttons just don’t register. Mouse input is good with the right trackpad for movement and triggers for mouse buttons but anything keyboard related is an issue there: it just doesn’t register various bindings set as keyboard buttons.</p>
<p>Age of Darkness: Final Stand, worked better and I could at least rebind some controls as Steam Input worked fully here. It even has UI scaling, so actually this was a bit of a surprise and was quite playable. However, the big issue of so many keybinds does remain and I felt a bit too slow moving around the map and building things. If it added in easy map scrolling with a thumbstick, that would be a dramatic improvement on Deck.</p>
<p>Iron Harvest on the other hand advertises <em>full</em> controller support and it works great! This title only needs their in-built UI scaling to be set to the highest by default on the Steam Deck, plus perhaps an extra patch to up the text size just a <em>bit</em> more and the experience here would actually be really good. Valve also remind you on their magnifier with titles that have small text, which is a pretty great feature.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17124502911645700019gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17124502911645700019gol1.jpg"/></a>Iron Harvest clearly shows how an RTS with a gamepad can be done.</em></p>
<p>Really, to play RTS games on Deck, the vast majority of them are going to need major updates to their UI and input systems. Aside from that specific genre, most other titles I tried didn’t really have those issues.</p>
<p>One part of this I haven’t yet touched on, but will in future articles and videos, is cloud gaming. There’s a reason for that and another caveat. Currently, Google Chrome cannot pick up the Deck as a gamepad. Valve told me they “worked with Microsoft to diagnose the controller issue, and since then we’ve worked with Google to ensure Steam Deck controls work with Google Chrome”. The update is <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/c9bc4476626e413fac9fac8b08e4b2110ee344f2" target="_blank">in progress</a>, available in the Dev channel of Chrome where it works but not yet in the stable browser. I’m keeping an eye on it and will cover it fully when it’s sorted and show off Stadia, Xbox Game Cloud and more.</p>
<p><strong>Ah, but can it run Cyberpunk 2077?</strong></p>
<p><em>Made you wait for this one didn’t I?</em></p>
<p>Yes it can, allow me to demonstrate with the benchmark mode:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a59bfHmdSxo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cdfc6eea1e7031d134044d8453e0cf6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a59bfHmdSxo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><u>Tip</u>: footage made using the ClonerAlliance Flint 4KP Plus (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07YY52YP6/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>), works great for capturing the Deck.</p>
<p>Something I will note is that the experience is not quite perfect yet with Cyberpunk 2077 and the Steam Deck. On first run, you might see an old looking Windows-styled error box come up about a file error for the launcher, tapping retry seemed to make it just go away. Really, skipping the launcher is the best bet by adding “--launcher-skip” as a Steam launch option. Additionally, sometimes it won’t start with Cyberpunk giving you an error message. Simply retrying works again. A few annoyances but otherwise it works well enough. Additionally, the gameplay feels <em>more</em> intensive than what the benchmark shows after testing for many hours on Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Benchmark results:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8524898531645562729gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8524898531645562729gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>How is battery life on Cyberpunk though? That was tested too and it’s not great, because it’s another <em>very</em> heavy AAA game. Low preset, 50% on brightness and volume again:</p>
<ol>
<li>60 FPS: 1.25 hours</li>
<li>30 FPS: 1.46 hours</li>
</ol>
<p><em>For wattage it’s just constantly high in both modes, well above 20w the majority of the time. Even in 30FPS mode I saw a lot of 25/26w. 60FPS didn’t actually pull much more, perhaps only 2–3w more as in either case, it’s a power hog.</em></p>
<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>
<p>Depending on what model you go for you’re looking at either £349 / £459 / £569 with the difference being included drive space / drive speed and the top end model having the anti-glare screen. Is it actually good value for money based on what it can do?</p>
<p>When you compare with other PC-styled handhelds on the market, the choice (to me) is perfectly clear. The others like AYA NEO and ONEXPLAYER just can’t touch it. They’re vastly more expensive and they don’t give all that much more. Valve has managed to hit an almost magical price to performance ratio here and it will be incredibly difficult for other vendors to compete with.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is another one that you could compare against. Different markets here though quite considerably but it’s still a portable unit. All models of the Switch are cheaper, sure, but there’s a lot more than just the hardware to think on. Nintendo software is expensive and usually stays expensive, as are a lot of non-Nintendo games for the Switch. Valve has tens of thousands of games on Steam of all genres and, unless you’re a die-hard Nintendo fan, to me the choice is incredibly obvious — once again the Deck just comes out on top. I own a Switch, and I play on it often, so this is not a stance from some sort of Valve “fanboy” (I consider myself quite far from one actually). The regular massive sales that Valve holds on Steam opens up so many thousands of great gaming choices.</p>
<p>Steam also gives you the possibility to use services like EA Access too, which works great for the Steam Deck. Subscribe and then get a whole bunch of their games easily. This was also tested working just fine on Deck.</p>
<p>Oh, and modding? Yeah the Steam Deck has that too. The Steam Workshop is all there and hooked up, so you can add that into it when thinking about the value that the Steam Deck provides. Gaming and modding on the go — you cannot beat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16845119471645795309gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16845119471645795309gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Trying to find Noita mods to help me live a little longer…</em></p>
<p>You have to think about other things too if you’re going to compare it to, say, another console. Free cloud saves, free online play, Valve don't have any silly rules on cross-platform play and wide compatibility with accessories is another one. The Steam Deck will work with Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo and other random controllers. As long as Linux supports it, the Steam Deck will — and that goes for a <em>lot</em> of other things you might plug into it with no mess of installing drivers.</p>
<p>The value of the Steam Deck is simply <em>unmatched</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term support and the future?</strong></p>
<p>Will this be the future of handhelds? Any current solvable teething issues and quirks aside, I think it very well could be. It just gives you so many more options compared to the traditionally locked down few that I really want it to be. Some people will never get over the size of it, and that I feel is totally fair. It is a big unit but over time perhaps a Steam Deck 2 can solve that a little.</p>
<p>Truth is though, we’re not really going to get a good idea of what that future may look like until at least the end of 2022. Once many more units are in the hands of more normal users, and then we've had time to see how Valve continues to support it and improve it. I’m especially keen to see how Deck Verified continues to improve and grow.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a number of comments (some from quite prominent names in gaming and some Valve followers) about how Valve can flip-flop between things, often not following through. The Steam Deck is vastly different and people saying such things have missed some big points.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is very much “just” a PC, squished into a small form factor with a screen strapped to it. Okay, it’s a fair bit <em>more</em> intricate than that but you get what I’m saying here. You can do <em>whatever</em> the heck you want with it. It’s built on top of the <em>years</em> they’ve already spent doing things like the Steam Controller, Steam Link, Proton and funding so many Linux advancements I’ve lost count. Keep in mind that the Steam Controller continues to benefit from Steam Input upgrades (and the Deck will too), plus Steam Link is now an app you can install anywhere and continues to be updated. The Steam Deck is just a big evolution of many things.</p>
<p>Steam itself is continuously updated which will keep benefiting it, and a huge portion of what makes the Steam Deck is open source. I think long-term, the Steam Deck will just keep getting more incredible. Although not perfect, Valve has set the next ultimate standard here for portables. It’s a revolutionary device.</p>

<p>You know what this reminds me of? The start of Google Android. Seriously. I was there for the first Android device, I adored it and the whole experience feels somewhat similar. Early days, but absolutely <em>crammed</em> full of potential and it’s exciting as hell.</p>
<p>Hey, it comes at a good time too! It’s damn hard to get even a semi-decent GPU to game with. The Steam Deck can clearly handle quite a lot <em>and</em> it’s a great introduction to PC gaming for newer players too thanks to that. Might even be good value as an upgrade for some people.</p>
<p>There’s a <strong>lot</strong> more I’m going to be saying about this over the coming weeks and months (and hopefully years), with plenty more planned and in progress like: Remote Play and Cloud Gaming, using a 4K TV, getting a Switch-like experience, various quirks and downsides, Deck as a desktop replacement, various guides, emulation options, retro gaming, Luxtorpeda for newer game engines and so on. These are just my <em>initial</em> thoughts so stay tuned. Some bits I simply wasn’t able to do yet, due to either time or waiting on updates from Valve or other developers. Feel free to let me know in the comments what other types of Steam Deck content you want to see!</p>
<p>I suppose there’s no bigger endorsement really than simply mentioning this — my own personal reservation is absolutely sticking. I’m definitely getting that 512GB model and <strong>I can’t wait</strong> to get it sometime in Q2. Sorry Valve, until then you’re not getting this review unit back, I need my fix.</p>

      <title>RimWorld upgrades for Steam Deck delayed by the situation in Ukraine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld will be getting some upgrades to make it look great on the Steam Deck but it's going to take a little longer.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/294100/view/3128317225025490603" target="_blank">statement</a> released on Steam, Ludeon Studios head wrote that the developer who was working on it lives in Ukraine, and the situation there right now of course is terrifying. They mentioned getting a Deck to this developer was delayed and the current situation means progress couldn't be made on it. Another developer is now taking over the Steam Deck upgrades instead but it's going to take a little bit longer.</p>
<p>Currently, they said it does work on the Steam Deck (and it has a native Linux version) but "there are a number of UI issues and some general jankiness we intend to solve with an update".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1817966721645801109gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1817966721645801109gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For now RimWorld is officially listed as "Playable" for Steam Deck, with the notes mentioning it sometimes shows the wrong icons and some text requires manually opening the keyboard. Ludeon Studios suggest waiting for their update to be out before diving in.</p>
<p>You can buy RimWorld from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rimworld?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/rimworld?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>THQ Nordic do a nice little overview of their games for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck is so close to release you can almost touch it and so we're seeing a trickle of more news come in. One bit is publisher THQ Nordic, who have released a short video.</p>
<p>It might not be the longest video you will watch today, and it doesn't actually show a Steam Deck. That's not the point though! Developers and publishers are talking about it and they're clearly quite excited. We can't actually embed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DFenHOrqbo" target="_blank">the video</a> here for you to see, as once again Google has slapped an Age Gate on it, which only works directly on YouTube.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING is out and Verified for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING is the latest game developed by FromSoftware who are known for games including Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Dark Souls. It's out now, with a Steam Deck Verified rating - so it works on Linux with Steam Play Proton. <u>Note</u>: copy personally purchased thanks to our supporters.</p>
<p><em>One of the biggest games of the year working so soon - what a beautiful sight.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qqiC88f9ogU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b46563c77f4824752e0303bea91b8aad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qqiC88f9ogU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Testing on my Arch Linux / EndeavourOS desktop, you'll need to make sure it's set to run with <u>Proton Experimental</u> and it seems you need the "bleeding-edge" Beta. Right click on Proton Experimental -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; select the bleeding-edge option. Careful though, this will then make any game you have that's set to Proton Experimental also use the Beta. This is until Valve release a new build of Proton Experimental directly.</p>
<p>However, it seems there's an issue with the new Steam Easy Anti-Cheat integration, so you may see an error about it failing to load the module and not let you play. If you do see it, there's a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5613#issuecomment-1050370073" target="_blank">workaround</a> available for now to play <em>offline</em>. Use at your own risk. In the games folder (somewhere like ".local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game"<br/>
), you can use these commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cp start_protected_game.exe stpg.exe.bak<br/>
cp eldenring.exe start_protected_game.exe</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It's just a very simple copy command to make a backup and then swap the exe it launches.</em></p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.2 (plus a hotfix) adds GOG support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> is truly becoming one of the best game managers available for Linux. Not only does it support Epic Games, it's just expanded to cover GOG too.</p>
<p>For the new GOG support, Heroic is able to download games using the Galaxy API (Windows and macOS) and for Linux you can use the offline installers that developers put up. It also supports DLC, you can run native Linux downloads using the Steam Runtime (requires Steam installed of course) which can fix some dependencies errors and pick languages for games that support it.</p>
<p>At least one account is required to use Heroic, so you can pick between GOG and Epic or use them both. There's also now a game store indicator / logo on the page for each game so you know where it's from.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/204860621645722361gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/204860621645722361gol1.png"/></a>Picks up my GOG collection nicely.</em></p>
<p>The UI was adjusted for the GOG integration as well of course. There's an expandable Library list now in the left panel, you have an updated settings page to list accounts, a few bug fixes and an upgrade of Electron to v17.0.1.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - what to expect for launch tomorrow with nearly 800 titles Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Apart from mass hype, what can we actually expect when the <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> releases tomorrow? Here's what's going on.</p>
<p>Starting at 10 AM PST / 6PM UTC, Valve will begin sending out emails to people in the first batch of reservations. So keep an eye on your emails and Steam app notifications. Once you get it, you have 72 hours to make the full purchase otherwise it goes to the next person in the queue.</p>
<p>When this happens, the embargo on all coverage also ends. Valve said they sent out a Steam Deck to "roughly 100 media outlets" (including yours truly). So expect loads of very different takes on it.</p>
<p>As for the Dock, Valve aren't yet giving out more details but they did say it won't be as early as they hoped. It will be available sometime "in late spring".</p>
<p>How is compatibility looking the day before release? Pretty darn good actually! You can check how your library currently stacks up on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/mygames" target="_blank">new official page</a>. 783 titles are at least Playable right now split across:</p>
<ul>
<li>409 - Verified</li>
<li>374 - Playable</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't know yet what kind of splash Valve will make, I imagine some sort of sale will happen on Verified games - at least that's what I would expect at the very least. It's also possible we might see some new game announcements too, but what? Well, there's been a few hints to that.</p>
<p>AMD recently put up a <a href="https://twitter.com/AMD/status/1496537758084608002" target="_blank">video</a> on Twitter to show it off, with Jack Huynh very clearly showing off a Destiny 2 t-shirt, which is either a hint of something to come or Huynh is just a big fan. It does make you think though, their marketing would need to have signed off on it, why wear a branded t-shirt of a game you can't even play on it hmm?</p>
<p>On top of that we've also seen that Apex Legends has a Steam Deck testing depot (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/depots/?branch=steam_deck" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>), so they're clearly doing something. That's bad news for me, since I told our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a> community if it worked with Proton on Linux / Steam Deck that I would livestream it everyday for a month and I fear I will be held to that…</p>
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is another that's clearly testing for the Steam Deck (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/552500/depots/?branch=steam_deck_testing" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) and there's probably others we've not seen yet.</p>

      <title>Dota 2 gets another new hero with Primal Beast, Techies reworked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dota 2 just got a pretty huge update that not only brings in a fierce new hero with Primal Beast, but finally reworks Techies in the gameplay patch too.</p>
<p>Primal Beast: "Rushing savagely through enemies and allies alike, Primal Beast pounds into battle as one born to raise a ruckus. An unavoidable threat amidst any fray, the Beast can punish attackers and relishes grabbing prey to repeatedly slam them against the ground until nothing but mush remains." — a new quite simple to play Melee hero. Here's their abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onslaught - Primal Beast charges up and then runs in the chosen direction, knocking back enemies and allies alike. Enemy units are damaged and stunned on impact. The longer the charge duration, the farther Primal Beast's momentum will carry him. Can be cancelled at any time with the Stop command.</li>
<li>Trample - Primal Beast stomps over everything. For every 140.0 units travelled, all enemies around the Beast receive damage. Deals base damage plus a multiplier of Primal Beast's attack damage. Primal Beast is disarmed for the duration of the ability.</li>
<li>Uproar - The Beast's temper passively provides base bonus damage. Additionally, for every instance of 35.0 damage or more Primal Beast takes from enemy heroes, he accumulates stacks of Uproar. When activated, Primal Beast releases a roar that slows surrounding enemies and grants the Beast additional attack damage and armour for 7.0 seconds based on his current stacks of Uproar.</li>
<li>Pulverize  - Primal Beast channels his rage, grabbing the target enemy and slamming them into the ground repeatedly, damaging and mini-stunning any enemies caught in the AoE. Lasts 2.3 seconds.</li>
<li>Rock Throw (Shard Grants New Ability) - Primal Beast throws a rock at the target location that stuns and damages enemies. The rock cannot be thrown within a minimum range of Primal Beast.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1158521161645714362gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1158521161645714362gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for Techies, they got a new little intro about the update: "After losing multiple contracts to potential teammates with better 'fit,' the contentious crew of Techies Demolitions have updated the tools in their blast box to better find business in trying times. Finally understanding what it means to be team players, the Techies spent a few bomb-focused brainstorming sessions dreaming up new ways to inflict joyous pain and are more equipped than ever to thrive in the thick of battle. Some tools of their trade may be new, but the infectious laughter of this terrible trio will never change."</p>
<p>Their abilities now include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticky Bomb (New Ability) - Techies lob a bomb cart onto a target area. If the cart lands near an enemy, it sticks to them and reduces movement speed briefly before exploding.</li>
<li>Reactive Tazer (New Ability) -  Techies trigger a zap that provides a jolt of movement speed and temporarily disarms enemies attacking them. At the end of its charge, the zap explodes, disarming enemies in the area.</li>
<li>Blast Off! - Techies launch themselves into the air, dealing massive explosion damage to themselves and enemies upon landing. Importantly, this blast no longer deals lethal damage to Techies.</li>
<li>Proximity Mines - Now Techies’ ultimate ability. Techies plant a deadly mine that only appears visible when an enemy is close enough for it to explode.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They also released a set of wallpapers and they're pretty awesome actually.</em></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/primalbeast" target="_blank">full update page</a> for more. I'm starting to feel a hankering to play Dota 2 again, especially after blasting through Dota: Dragon's Blood Season 2 - which was great.</p>
<p>Dota 2 is free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roguebook adds a timed Tournament system, new character DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roguebook, the singeplayer roguelike deckbuilder from the developer of Faeria just got a big upgrade with a new Tournament system, plus a DLC character.</p>
<p>If you do wish to try out the new character, it's going to appear in the first few days of the new tournaments. After a few days, it will go back into the random pool. Their tournament system sounds a bit like a daily run, however they start at the same time for everyone - so you need to be there. A little restrictive, so hopefully there will be many spread across different times. They explained they know it won't be for everyone but it's a race. As for the new character, check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0mpFI_6SZRc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6224a7da5ade17ebe1ada32eadfad875.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0mpFI_6SZRc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DLC Character Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new playable hero, with a unique treasure, talents and embellishments to unlock</li>
<li>Over 50 new cards that make the most of Fugoro's unique mechanics: magical coins, marks and agility</li>
<li>Fully voiced and animated, Fugoro interacts throughout the adventure and reveals more about the lore of Roguebook</li>
<li>The unique treasure of Fugoro, Merchant of Wonders, is the Magic Staff: the first attack Fugoro performs each turn generates +5 power.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress gets a roadmap, Linux version included</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Steam</a> version of Dwarf Fortress sounds exciting, bringing in a whole new generation to the classic and they've finally given something of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3099043827445055732" target="_blank">roadmap</a> to release. Still the same great classic game but modernised with official graphics and sound effects - hooray!</p>
<p>Included in their post is a 6-point plan of work still to be done that includes various amounts of UI work with hotkeys and tooltips, the continued work on graphics, bug fixing, Steam Workshop support, Steam Achievements, supporting the different game modes and the confirmation of Linux and macOS builds too!</p>
<p>However, it sounds like some of this may come post-launch (including Linux / macOS) and they're currently looking to release in "the fall" as the earliest possible time so we're looking at probably late September to late December.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>3.3 &#39;Libra&#39; update out now for Stellaris</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive has released the 3.3 'Libra' Update for Stellaris, as their "custodians" initiative continues with a dedicated team working on free updates. There's a huge assortment of fixes available from game balance to AI adjustments.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Unity system rework</li>
<li>Added planetary ascensions</li>
<li>Improved AI economy management</li>
<li>Performance improvements</li>
<li>New anomalies, dig sites and story events</li>
<li>Bug fixes and modding improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance improvements are going to be welcome, which were focused around pop job weight calculations and some game engine adjustments. Paradox say you should see a "50%" decrease in the time it takes per year at the start of the game. Of course that should translate into the later game too, when things usually start slowing.</p>

      <title>The next release of free RTS 0 A.D. will have some new graphics options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is a free and open source historical RTS that's been in development for a long time. Each release is impressive and it sounds like the next release is going to look pretty shiny.</p>
<p>Sharing an update on <a href="https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/71485-new-graphics-options-improved-texture-quality/" target="_blank">their official forum</a>, one of the developers noted how they've added in Anisotropic filtering which should bring the game to life even more for those of you with a reasonable PC. See the below picture they shared for a comparison with it (click picture to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18304779721647601205gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18304779721647601205gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Must say, that does look quite a bit better when you have a good look - but is it something you will notice while you're scrolling the camera around? Perhaps not so much but still, it's another tick in the box to help 0 A.D. look even more crispy.</p>
<p>This next update won't only be good for those with powerful computers though, there's also new options for weaker systems too. You will be able to actually decrease the texture quality, something most other modern 3D games also allow.</p>

      <title>UnderRail is preparing for the Steam Deck, won&#39;t be perfect just yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released back in 2015, UnderRail from Stygian Software is an old school turn-based isometric indie role playing game that focuses on exploration and combat. Now, they're trying to get it looking good on a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250520/view/3123812991783111311" target="_blank">update</a>, the developer mentions an update coming next week that "will be focused around making the game functional on Steam Deck and Proton in general". However, it's not going to be quite perfect yet as an improved UI and gamepad controls are to come later. Still, even some fixes are better than nothing for those who want to try it out. The developer said for now it will "still be completely functional on Steam Deck" and they've already fixed some performance issues with Proton, along with getting an on-screen keyboard to appear when needed. UnderRail will also be getting Steam Cloud support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h-kefd0cFWs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21e3c249e4bada851869e9c906b0a954.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h-kefd0cFWs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>These are the kind of updates from developers we were hoping to see. While it may not be "native", this sure to me looks like a good level of attention and support. More like this please!</p>
<p>You can buy UnderRail from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/underrail?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250520/UnderRail/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's been a few unofficial ways to check your own Steam Library for the Steam Deck, Valve has now put up the official way. Plus, we're getting closer to a thousand Playable titles now. Things are really heating up, with only two days left until the official release on February 25!</p>

      <title>City-builder Nebuchadnezzar adds Gods, Festivals and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nepos Games continue to expand their Pharaoh-like city-builder Nebuchadnezzar, with another big free update out.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar is a classic isometric city builder game inviting players to experience the mysterious history and culture of ancient Mesopotamia. In the campaign, players get to rule over influential historical cities filled with magnificent monuments.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14388427141645543030gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14388427141645543030gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights of update version 1.3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gods, devoted monuments and shrines - choose from more than 40 gods to worship to provide bonuses to fit and support your playstyle.</li>
<li>Festivals - organize great festivals to please your gods.</li>
<li>Extended and colourable decorations - customize your city exactly to your taste. Just choose any decoration you like and use your favourite colours to design a unique look for your city.</li>
<li>Events manager - decide which events are important for you and do not get distracted by the others.</li>
<li>Reworked map editor - completely new map editor which allows you to easily create new maps with a new graphical user interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, it's quite clear they released perhaps too early considering all the new big features they've added over the last few updates. Still, it's really good to see such good post-release support. It's now hit a Very Positive rating on Steam too.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/nebuchadnezzar" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1157220/Nebuchadnezzar/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Klei fixes up Don&#39;t Starve Together for Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei Entertainment are another developer working to ensure their games work well on the Steam Deck, with an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/322330/announcements/detail/4345413859074869119" target="_blank">update</a> now available for Don't Starve Together.</p>
<p>Currently, as of when it was last tested (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/322330/history/?changeid=13834631" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>), Don't Starve Together was very close to being fully Deck Verified. However, it seems there were issues with needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard. Hopefully then, Klei has fixed that up which would mean it would go from Playable to Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3777406951645532948gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3777406951645532948gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The update released recently includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Deck support</li>
<li>Koalefant Trunk Steak’s name and icon now shows up correctly in the cookbook ingredient lists</li>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing Crabking and Dragonfly from spawning after their world settings are changed from none to something else.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when ramming burnt Above Average Tree Trunks.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare Kitcoon crash</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with the world presets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you think Don't Starve Together is something you will play on the Steam Deck? It's constantly in the top 50 most played games on Steam, so it's not really a big surprise to see it get updated. It usually sees over 30,000 people playing it each day (concurrent users).</p>

      <title>Valve gives SteamVR and Linux a little love in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While I absolutely love playing with my Valve Index, it has felt like for a while that Valve left things a bit too rough but a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/4997309907382422807" target="_blank">SteamVR update</a> is out now.</p>
<p>Giving a little love to everyone, here's what's been tweaked for SteamVR directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a motion smoothing issue that was affecting some applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to application submitted dx12 depth textures.</li>
<li>Fix for depth texture handling on dx12 causing crashes in major engine implementations.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the dashboard.</li>
<li>Display Task View if a non-interactable window gains input focus in Desktop View.</li>
<li>Added a button to Desktop View that allows users to show the desktop. This is especially useful when users have a single monitor and the scene app displays a full screen window.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on app startup.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically for Linux (finally!) Valve solved a few persistent issues including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that would prevent some system UI from working some of the time.</li>
<li>Fixed webhelper crashing in OS's with recent versions of freetype2.</li>
<li>Fixed a failure to unpack steamrt-heavy on some distributions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With this update, it sounds like the experience with SteamVR will be quite a bit smoother on Linux which makes me happy. While I never personally saw the third issue, the first two were something I was truly getting frustrated with.</p>
<p>Do let us know in the comments if you use SteamVR and how this update runs for you!</p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead 2 gets Steam Deck Verified, Team Fortress 2 only Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What's that? More Valve games will be able to run on the Steam Deck? You got that right. Both Left 4 Dead 2 and Team Fortress 2 popped up recently. Earlier we saw that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/half-life-2-and-the-episodes-get-updated-and-hl2-now-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">Half-Life 2 is now verified</a> and we know this once again thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, who track basically everything Steam.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead 2 appears fully <em>Verified</em> for Steam Deck, so out of the box it should be a great experience overall. However, in the case of Team Fortress 2 it's only mentioned that it's <em>Playable</em>. For TF2 the issues seem to be a mix of text being too small and it doesn't have the best gamepad support. While on one hand it shows that Valve have work to do even for their owns games, on the other it shows they're at least honest about Deck compatibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7542967921645475836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7542967921645475836gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's no surprise to see Left 4 Dead 2 getting high marks though, since it did just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/left-4-dead-2-gets-updated-ready-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">get updated recently</a>. Do you think Valve will ever go back and properly update TF2?</p>
<p>Will you be pumping hours into either of these on Deck? Let us know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 13:  Looks Almost Unreal</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-12-in-tremendous-pain/" target="_blank">Part 12: In Tremendous Pain</a></strong></p>
<p>It is rare for Linux to see support from both sides of an industry battle, but that is exactly where we were with the release of <em>Quake III Arena</em> and <em>Unreal Tournament</em>. With both games aiming to package the full breadth of the online multiplayer shooter experience into a standalone title, the competition between the two was fierce. I myself have always favoured the solid craftsmanship of <em>Quake III Arena</em>, but the greater variety in <em>Unreal Tournament</em> has to be admired.</p>
<p>Some versions ship with a Linux installer already on the disc, but with the <em>Game of the Year Edition</em> you need to download the ut-install-436-goty.run setup script which grants all of the official patches. This proved a smooth process even when swapping between CD-ROMs, but the installer can be too opaque, not telling you outside of the terminal output that it is busy decompressing maps. This can take some time, making it easy to assume that the setup has stalled.</p>
<p><em>Unreal Tournament</em> only came alive when I set the XFree86 server to 32 bit colour depth, not just improving the visuals and clearing up the numerous Z Buffer artifacts, but also helping to level out the game performance. From there I tweaked the UnrealTournament.ini file, setting "NoDynamicLighting" to "True" and "UseGammaExtension" to "1", with "Coronas" and "VolumetricLighting" set to "False". Like this the game was playable and still looked better than on first launch.</p>
<p>Even with those changes I never felt that it reached a comfortable level of performance, despite my hardware matching the requirements listed on the box. To catch up to what I achieved with <em>Quake III Arena</em> I had to escalate to the point of turning off all lighting entirely, leaving every map looking grey and uninteresting for just a marginal speed increase. With OpenGL on Linux at least, <em>Unreal Tournament</em> does scream for the power of a Radeon or a GeForce graphics card.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of Glide was its lower CPU overhead, so it is also possible a more powerful processor may have helped. Regardless, I am under no doubt that the game would still run smoother paired with a Voodoo card under Glide, as all of the contemporary coverage implies. In general my Rage 128 Pro has been great under Windows 98, but I have been feeling far more of a pull back towards the old 3dfx world order on Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7159689251644569905gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7159689251644569905gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17669074741645229463gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17669074741645229463gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Unreal Tournament</em> benefited from running at 32 bit colours with Direct3D as well, with Windows 98 giving a better showing than Linux did. In the City Intro timedemo Windows 98 managed an average of 40 FPS as opposed to just 30 FPS on Linux with a lot of churn when using my optimized settings. For the sake of argument I also tried the community made UTGLR 3.6 enhanced OpenGL renderer, but it proved heavier than the default SDL implementation on period hardware.</p>
<p>While I have played my fair share of deathmatches, I had never actually played through the single player campaign before. Someone spent a great deal of time writing the flavour text, leaving it a shame that it has next to no relevance to the actual gameplay. The bots in <em>Quake III Arena</em> show more individual personality through their dialogue and character designs than the bots in <em>Unreal Tournament</em> do, even with that one character blurb which is a dig at economists.</p>
<p>The few exceptions are the Skaarj Hybrids and those found in the Challenge ladder, who do exert more of a presence on the battlefield. I will admit to missing out by not trying Domination or Assault before, as it is here with team and objective based games that <em>Unreal Tournament</em> does excel over its competition. I also appreciate the tutorials made for each mode, although they neglect to inform you how to issue orders to your team until the final Assault tutorial.</p>
<p>I did encounter some bugs, such as sound effects interrupting one another and a few hardlocks. Like with <em>Quake II</em> these were sporadic but tend to cluster on certain maps, with the worst offender being "AS-Overlord". I came within 26 seconds of winning before the game crashed, and it kept freezing. My solution was the same as with the "Water Treatment Plant" level in the first <em>Quake II</em> mission pack, namely playing through the map in software rendering instead.</p>
<p>Even without a source code release, community support for <em>Unreal Tournament</em> has been stellar, with the OldUnreal project under the blessing of Epic Games being the current torchbearer. Thanks to them the game still runs great on modern Linux distributions, being easier to setup than even <em>Unreal Tournament 2003</em> and <em>Unreal Tournament 2004</em> now are, the latter two seeing Linux ports thanks to Ryan Gordon. The community even managed to bring over what came before it.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest is live once again with plenty of indie demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to have a busy week? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest: February 2022 Edition</a> is officially live and there's plenty of indie developers showing off their latest. Not only can you expect to see a ton of limited-time playable demos (some devs keep them up), there's also a week full of livestreams and developer chats direct on store pages.</p>
<p>Obviously we can't go linking to every single possible demo and no one wants that - so what's around that's worth taking a look at? Here's a few I think could end up being something special:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Core Keeper</a></strong> has you build a base, mine resources, craft equipment and defeat giant monsters. A bit of everything.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1781030/Fishing_Paradiso/" target="_blank">Fishing Paradiso</a></strong> is a mix of a narrative-driven adventure with RPG-style progression systems. Yes, a fishing game with a proper story. I still can't quite believe it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1105470/Fist_of_the_Forgotten/" target="_blank">Fist of the Forgotten</a></strong> a platformer set in a harsh, dark world, but that doesn't mean you're helpless.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812380/Flock_of_Dogs/" target="_blank">Flock of Dogs</a></strong> a top-down, twin-stick, crew game. One player pilots a whale while everyone else rides flying dogs. Sounds hilarious.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1338580/McPixel_3/" target="_blank">McPixel 3</a></strong> sounds like it's going to be a good laugh full of crazy little adventures.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/" target="_blank">Stardeus</a></strong> is a sci-fi colony management simulator with aspects of automation, base building and space exploration.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">TFC: The Fertile Crescent</a></strong> a classic base-building RTS set in the Bronze Age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next Fest runs until February 28th at 10 AM PT / 6 PM UTC.</p>
<p>Be sure to comment with any you find that are particularly great.</p>

      <title>Classic base-building RTS TFC: The Fertile Crescent hits Steam on March 29</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a new strategy game I'm excited to play! TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a pixel-art take on the classic base-building RTS genre and it's entering Early Access on March 29.</p>
<p>Inspired of course by some of the greats, this title places quite the emphasis on its multiplayer and community tournaments. However, they've also mentioned over email in a press release there's going to be a special "Horde Mode" that will "have its own rules with an opponent in the form of nomads". During Early Access they also plan to add in more additional modes and there's going to be a brand new refresh interface compared with the old free version on <a href="https://lincread.itch.io/the-fertile-crescent" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nSGXMCTvivE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1dd190ea4eb31cf630a7d2785eeb8b13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nSGXMCTvivE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I played quite a lot of hours in the original version, which proved to be pretty great. The food system is certainly interesting and helps set it apart from others in the genre. Food isn't just for producing new units, your stock also affects many other parts of your growth and how quickly you gain knowledge points for research.</p>
<p>They will also have a full demo available during Steam Next Fest, with it already up now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Feral Interactive have no plans to update their Linux ports for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since we were asked a lot about this, we reached out to porting studio Feral Interactive to see if they had any plans to update their Linux ports for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Feral have ported a number of titles to Linux in the past including Alien Isolation, XCOM &amp; XCOM 2, Total War: WARHAMMER I &amp; II, Total War: THREE KINGDOMS, HITMAN, the Tomb Raider series, Life is Strange &amp; Before the Storm &amp; Life is Strange 2, Dirt Rally and the list goes on. They also have a port of Total War: WARHAMMER III upcoming in "Early Spring".</p>
<p>After waiting quite a while, they replied today with an official statement about Steam Deck support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our most recent Linux titles are officially supported on Ubuntu only, and we do not currently have any plans to update games for further compatibility with Steam Deck or its operating system, SteamOS 3.0. If players encounter issues with Feral's native Linux versions of games on Steam Deck, we recommend playing them via Proton.</p>

      <title>Co-op survival horror Pacify gets Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One we missed from earlier this month, Pacify is a very popular survival horror and the developer has been making improvements ready for the Steam Deck. It has a Very Positive rating from 23,297 user reviews, so it must be quite something.</p>
<p>Released back in 2019, the developer released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/967050/view/3092286526400968816" target="_blank">update</a> on February 7 to include various optimizations for the Steam Deck. They say at Medium quality you can expect a smooth 60FPS while playing which sounds ideal. They also included this nice shot of it running on Deck:</p>

<p>Not sure how I feel about playing something like this on a Steam Deck. It's bad enough sat at a PC, what if it makes me jump and I throw the Deck out of my hands? Oh gosh.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t expect GOG to support the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck only a few days away from release, it seems people are wondering the support status of other stores. Seems <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> won't be supporting it, which isn't surprising.</p>
<p>Currently, GOG does support Linux with direct downloads, although they only officially support a few versions of Ubuntu. They do not, however, support GOG Galaxy on Linux. This has been a bit of a problem, as some games with multiplayer rely on Galaxy meaning a few Linux builds on GOG came without multiplayer.</p>
<p>Speaking on Twitter, in reply to a YouTuber asking if they will support the Steam Deck they <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1495670845334822912" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no official GOG support for SteamDeck. But since the device has an open architecture, as we understand, you can install Windows and as such also run GOG games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They never replied to our email enquiring about it.</em></p>
<p>Technically, you won't need to do that. GOG Galaxy can run in Wine, although unsupported. On top of that, projects like <a href="https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/" target="_blank">Minigalaxy</a> exist, <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> has GOG download support, <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> has a GOG installer and even <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/flaviofearn/status/1495728201456365570" target="_blank">working on</a> Linux support that's close to release - so there's options available on SteamOS 3 with the Steam Deck to get GOG games. However, Galaxy features are generally locked to their own app.</p>
<p>One reason that's likely GOG aren't working to expand their Linux support to Galaxy and Steam Deck, is that they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">aren't exactly doing well financially</a>.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2 and the episodes get updated and HL2 now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only are Valve continuing to go over third-party games, they also continue upgrading their own with a fresh update out for Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One and Half-Life 2: Episode Two.</p>
<p>All three of them recently had an update that noted "UI and Input support for Steam Deck verification", although only the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> has been fully Steam Deck Verified so far. This is the finalization of work that went into <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/half-life-2-getting-a-new-ui-in-prep-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">a Beta recently</a>, to give them a new gamepad friendly UI.</p>
<p>The original UI:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10730520111645432199gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10730520111645432199gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When set with "-gamepadui" as a launch option:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2515124571645432200gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2515124571645432200gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Considering how popular it still is, it's a good thing to have it ready for the Deck. A little Half-Life on the go? Will you be playing this one on Deck?</p>

      <title>Inspired by Cube World, the free Veloren 0.12 release is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fully free and open source, Veloren continues to expand their inspiration from Cube World and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with version 0.12 out now.</p>
<p>It's still very far from a properly released game but it's coming together, with new content available in this release. Some of what's new includes: a sailing bot, sneaking with weapons drawn, a system for spawning smaller tree-like plants into the world, the ability to toggle always showing health and energy bars, waterfalls, wearable headgear (hood, crown, bandanas), you can mount and ride pets now, arthropods added in, wallrunning and much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="604JC5QdYQE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/790939e2194b8cdc1dd7c4a796917845.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/604JC5QdYQE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Honestly, this is going to be big if they keep this up. I had a little while running around it today and it looks gorgeous at different light levels and there's already quite a lot to see around. Coming across plenty of other players too, some of which were very kind enough to dump random equipment on me - i'm not complaining, I now have some sort of cool fire staff and a wiggly sword.</p>
<p>You can download from the <a href="https://veloren.net/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Caves of Qud gets a big content upgrade, improved gamepad and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a game that will be thoroughly interesting to see on a Steam Deck. Caves of Qud is a fantastic science fantasy roguelike epic and the developers have been busy.</p>
<p>In the latest update not only have they added in a ton more content like two minor late-game regions, 48 new Achievements, makeovers to multiple areas, new animations and more — they've also made big improvements to gamepad support.</p>
<p>This new input system isn't fully ready and so it needs be manually enabled in the control settings under the pre-release option, but even so testing with an Xbox pad today it feels pretty great. It's good news for the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> too, as it's enabled by default if it detects you playing on it and scales things up a bit to be clearer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6203094651645202327gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6203094651645202327gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Never thought this would work so well with a gamepad.</p>
<p>Game Features (to name just a few...):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Assemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects and 24 castes and kits—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, quills, four arms, flaming hands, or the power to clone yourself—it's all the character diversity you could want.</li>
<li>Explore procedurally-generated regions with some familiar locations—each world is nearly 1 million maps large.</li>
<li>Dig through everything—don't like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.</li>
<li>Hack the limbs off monsters—every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.</li>
<li>Pursue allegiances with over 60 factions—apes, crabs, robots, and highly entropic beings—just to name a few.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Escape Simulator gets Linux fixes, networking improvements - ready for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big update arrived for Escape Simulator, the online co-op puzzle game that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/escape-simulator-hits-over-4m-in-gross-sales/" target="_blank">managed to sell a lot of copies</a> and so it should be ready for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This fresh free upgrade brings in The Alchemist set to make rooms with, additional updates to the room editor with new skyboxes and particle effects, new logic items and additions to existing items to create more challenges with and code optimizations. There's more though, they said they've fixed up some graphical issue for Linux and macOS, along with "Steam Deck support" - although they didn't elaborate on what they did. Some networking improvements were also made, that the developer said "should work much better for the community rooms". Could be a great game for the Steam Deck to run through a few puzzle rooms!</p>

      <title>Minecraft gets a Deep Dark biome and Warden mob in new 1.19 Snapshot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A very scary Minecraft 1.19 snapshot, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-very-scary-snapshot" target="_blank">Mojang say</a>, with the introduction of a new biome along with a new mob - and you can test it all out right now.</p>
<p>Exploring underground is about to get a lot more interesting, with the addition of the Deep Dark biome. Not only will you find Ancient City structures underground, you'll also come face to face with the Warden - a new mob. The Warden comes with a new Darkness mob effect, which is a major new mechanic. When nearby you'll be afflicted with it, which lowers the gamma down to a "Moody" level, making torches more important than ever. This can be tweaked in the Accessibility settings though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3920304061645181363gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3920304061645181363gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Careful, they sense vibrations and can smell you.</em></p>
<p>They also added Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Catalyst and Sculk Shrieker blocks. Some of these blocks will alert Wardens if you go too near, or step on them. This all sounds quite exciting actually, Minecraft is really starting to add in more fun things while exploring.</p>

      <title>An interview with James Spanos of Wormwood Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You asked: we delivered. Here's a chat with game developer extraordinaire James Spanos, who works with Wormwood Studios and publisher Wadjet Eye Games.</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> Could you first introduce yourself and tell us about your games?</p>
<p>“My name is James Spanos, I'm a game developer, with the major role of coder for Wormwood Studios, and working for/with Wadjet Eye Games, our publisher. I've worked on Primordia and Strangeland, both point and click adventure games released in 2012 and 2021, under Wormwood Studios, but I've worked on various titles throughout the years, like The Cat Lady and Downfall by Harvester Games, where I did some interface work for, and Mage's Initiation, where I worked on the combat system! I've been a gamer my whole life, so being able to work full time as a gamedev was always something I aspired to!”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6148525091645125454gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6148525091645125454gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured: Strangeland.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> Mark from Wormwood <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1369520/eventcomments/3046104862448157347/#c3046104862450397352" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam, that the Linux version of Strangeland was an "experiment". How do you feel it went?</p>
<p>“Strangeland's porting was an experiment in terms of, we had little to no time to test it out properly. Thankfully all the bugs got ironed out after its release. The difficulty with porting Strangeland to anywhere lies on the fact that the game relies heavily on the use of a custom made plugin, that handles audio and various visual effects, so it was quite difficult to test the port and I ended up installing a lot of native and virtual machine distribs of Linux, including Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, I've honestly lost count at this point, to ensure the audio system and the game as a whole works under the penguin flag.”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> If I have this right, you've been something of an absolute machine lately bringing titles to Linux either new or re-porting like Shardlight, Resonance, Technobabylon, Unavowed, Gemini Rue and The Blackwell Bundle. Why the sudden surge?</p>
<p>“So, this past December, Dave Gilbert, owner of Wadjet Eye Games, contacted me and offered me a position to handle the entirety of the WEG catalogue in any capacity. That basically means, I make sure the games have no bugs, store-related things, like achievements work, and porting the games to platforms. It's been a blast doing that, and of course a decent amount of hours, but I'm glad to say that things are less manicky on that part. The main reason to keep supporting the games, is something that I am personally invested in - I truly believe  that even if the amount of players that play on non-Windows systems are significantly less, it doesn't mean we shouldn't support LINUX and OSX, because those players are equal to my eyes and deserve the same amount and support.”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> How much effort is actually involved in bringing Adventure Game Studio titles to Linux?</p>
<p>“The effort is quite minimal to be honest, most of it requires testing and ensuring the engine doesn't have any issues, luckily all these games use the same engine as Strangeland which was thoroughly tested after its release. So long story short, testing the games making sure they can be completed, achievements for Steam can be unlocked (would love to be able to offer GOG GALAXY ACHIEVEMENTS, but unfortunately there's no native LINUX port of that client], was the main testing ground here for the re-porting of all the WEG titles. And of course setting the store pages, adding Steam cloud that works cross-platform, setting launch options. It's a lot of small things but all together they add up. “</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> In the era of Steam Play Proton, do you think it's worth the effort to do so?</p>
<p>“Even if the games will run fine on WINE, and PROTON, I still think native ports are the way to go. I think Linux is a wonderful OS and a very unsupported one. As a fan of it, I want to be able to offer a version of our games that is not "oh this is the windows version". It is easier to support the games that way, and we're impervious to let's say PROTON being discontinued or abandoned.”</p>
<p><u>Q:</u> For other developers looking to port to Linux, any advice for them?</p>
<p>“I will say this. Install any distribution you like, I'd start with UBUNTU since it's very user friendly, and spend some time inside it, see how it feels, how it works, learn the basics and the ins and outs of it, and do port your games to Linux, in most engines, it's literally automated, there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't offer a native port.”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> What do you think about the Steam Deck?</p>
<p>“I'm still waiting to get my hands on a devkit, but from what I've gathered it is running LINUX, so that means all the ports, we've done for the Nintendo Switch (Unavowed, Primordia) will be easily portable to it, and will offer controller support! I'm quite hyped about it, and I would really like to offer a steam deck version for all our games to the players!”</p>
<p><em>Editor side-note: the Steam Deck is powered by SteamOS 3 (based on Arch Linux).</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> What's it like to actually release a new point &amp; click adventure game in modern times? Games have come a very long way since the days of King's Quest, Broken Sword, Monkey Island and other earlier titles. How do you see them evolving with the times, or is it more about keeping the nostalgia alive perhaps?</p>
<p>“I think the adventure game genre still has a lot to offer, maybe not in a purebred adventure game fashion, but I think there are elements worth tinkering with from all the games that predate ours. And for absolutely valid reasons. I think instigating the sense of adventure and open paths, like Kings' Quest and Quest For Glory did prior, still holds up as a game mechanic. And of course the story telling, I think that will always hold up, most of the adventure games that came out during the golden years, have fascinating stories that make people to this day, play them.”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> What experience did you have with Linux previous to sorting all the ports?</p>
<p>“For a period of time, I didn't have Windows installed, so I was "forced" to use Linux, and I quite liked it. I think it was Ubuntu 10.04. So going back to Linux was quite natural, plus as a coder, typing commands in the terminal feels quite gratifying!”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> Do you think there are areas Linux really lacks for game developers?</p>
<p>“I don't believe so, I think the one major problem Linux has, is that major corporations seem to not want to invest into porting their applications/games to it, making it a chore/drag to install certain things. Besides that the amazingly helpful community counters that to some degree, but it would still be nice to make things more official for the end user!”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> What's your favourite Linux distribution and why?</p>
<p>“I never quite understood the appeal of Arch Linux, until recently where I installed Manjaro Arch, and it's my go-to Linux distrib. Arch seems to run on my system a lot more smoothly than Debian and Ubuntu, but most importantly it seems to be quite easier to install things into it, at least it seems to be more comfortable to my work flow. I don't think there's an awful Linux distribution per se - the ones I avoid are those that I've kept outdated for various reasons [mostly compatibility].”</p>
<p><u><strong>Q:</strong></u> What's next for you? Making more wonderful point and click adventure games?</p>
<p>“I'm currently working on porting more of the games to the Nintendo Switch, and working on a Survival/Resource Management game inside a moving train, called Carbonflesh (made with Unity). Nothing to show yet, because we're revamping the visuals atm, but hopefully soon I'll begin sharing things about it. It's a very different project for sure, and quite fascinating to me! Dave is working on Old Skies, a cyberpunk time-travelling point and click adventure game ofc! So I'll be porting that when it's done to places as well!”</p>

      <title>1 week from release, Steam Deck hits well over 640 Playable games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're now only a single week away from something amazing, Valve will be officially releasing the Steam Deck. Here's some updated numbers on what games you can expect to see working well. Looking back, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/520-games-are-now-rated-either-verified-or-playable-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">6 days ago</a> we noted there we 520 games rated as Verified or Playable together and the list has just kept growing.</p>
<p>Current totals (<strong><u>649</u></strong> are at least Playable now):</p>
<ul>
<li>370 - Verified</li>
<li>279 - Playable</li>
<li>319 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping in mind this is all very much going through constant change, more will be added practically every day. Just because something is Unsupported for now, doesn't mean it will stay that way. <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> is improving constantly, and developers can update their games and get them rechecked any time.</p>

      <title>Devolver Digital announces save-the-day adventure McPixel 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>McPixel 3 is coming from Sos Sosowski and Devolver Digital - but what happened to number 2? Guess that one got lost adventuring. Even their official announcement email was confused, telling us to join them in asking "What the hell happened to McPixel 2?".</p>
<p>The original released back in 2012 and this follow-up is described as: "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? It's falling too fast to be either of those. It's McPixel! A wanna-be hero who keeps getting mixed up in the most unbelievable situations you can imagine. Avert one disaster after another at every turn using unconventional yet entertaining methods of mayhem including - but not limited to - summoning a spider-billionaire, having a BBQ in his pants, punching a T-Rex into outer space, peeing into sports cars, and kicking Fork Parker in the balls."</p>

<p>Some of what to expect:</p>

<li>100 mind-blowing levels</li>

<li>Nearly 1500 interactive items</li>
<li>Over 20 minigames in all imaginable genres</li>

<li>A water level</li>

      <title>Valve clarifies how they test Native Linux or Proton for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who watch SteamDB updates, there's been a little bit of confusion on how Valve has been testing titles ready for the release of the Steam Deck on February 25. They've now fully clarified.</p>
<p>The issue surrounds what version they will pick for Deck Verified when games have a Native Linux build. There were a number that appeared on SteamDB, noting <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> as the runtime picked instead (meaning the Windows build was used). As example, an update for Portal 2 on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/620/history/?changeid=13854662" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (their own game) shows the recommended runtime being Proton. Turns out, this was not intended.</p>
<p>Valve shared via email (making clear this was not embargoed info): "early on, there were a limited number of titles that were tested via Proton before Linux before we made some policy changes. Since then all of those titles are already back in the queue for re-testing using their Linux builds".</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/compat#7" target="_blank">developer documentation</a> has been updated (right at the bottom) to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If my game has a native Linux version and is selected for review heuristically, will the compatibility review take place on the Linux build or under Proton?</strong><br/>
By default, we will test a Linux build if one is available. If the Linux build fails compatibility tests or otherwise experiences significant issues, we'll then test the Windows build of your game running under Proton. Our goal is for customers to have the smoothest experience possible on Deck, so we'll submit whichever set of test results is more favorable.<br/>
<br/>
Your compatibility test results will specify what runtime they were generated on. You can see details in the "Details" section of your report under the "Recommended Runtime" field.<br/>
<br/>
If you believe we tested the wrong version of your product, you can always submit for a re-review and specify the platform you'd like us to test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to remember: nothing is final, and even after the Steam Deck releases the Deck Verified program will be an ongoing thing. No doubt there will be changes to how it's run after release too as they continue to try and give players the best experience.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whalenought Studios and Modern Wolf have today released a native Linux port of Mechajammer, a tactical cyberpunk turn-based RPG set on an off-world grindhouse jungle colony. Mechajammer's inspirations are rooted in clasisc 80s sci-fi/action movies like Escape from New York, Robocop, and the first Terminator. With the dark atmosphere and plenty of low-tech, you can clearly see some of it shining through.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer  below:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mechajammer uses simultaneous turn-based combat to create real-time tactics with the precision of turn-based controls.</li>
<li>Freely roam through the streets of an off-world cyberpunk city, the killer jungles outside its walls, and the occult syndicate hollows below.</li>
<li>Recruit large squads of mercenaries, gang members, and thieves as companions. Issue commands to the whole squad to keep the turn-based combat fast and exciting.</li>
<li>You and your crew of deserters have crashed onto a hostile jungle colony. To escape, you must gather rumors, bribe enemies, and earn trust through completing missions. In this immersive sim choose your path wisely, as your story options will shift with every choice.</li>
<li>Deep and fully customizable character creation allows you to experiment and design your own playstyle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They did provide a code for us to take a look at it, so keep an eye out for some thoughts to come.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy of Mechajammer via <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/mechajammer" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/485400/Mechajammer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Intel confirms standalone Arc Graphics due in Q2, also &#39;Project Endgame&#39; this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel has confirmed some updates to their tech roadmap today and the good news is that Arc Graphics are on the way.</p>
<p>For notebooks, Intel Arc Alchemist will be arriving in the first quarter of this year. We already mostly knew this though, as they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/intel-announces-new-cpus-more-detail-on-arc-qalchemistq-graphics/" target="_blank">confirmed that before</a>. At least now though, we're getting clearer info on standalone cards for desktops - which will be due out in Q2 (April - June). Intel think they will manage to ship "4 million" discrete GPUs in 2022 which would be across laptops, consumer desktops and workstations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Intel Arch Battlemage GPUs are scheduled for "2023-2024". Not only that, they've begun work on what they're calling Celestial, gearing up for the "ultra-enthusiast segment", so those will likely be cards directly facing off against something like an NVIDIA 3080 Ti / 3090 and those will be available "2024+".</p>
<p>This is going to be great. Not only will we finally see what another major GPU vendor can bring to the table for competition, but also more GPUs on the market as a whole. Oh, and since it's Intel, the drivers will be open source on Linux too of course which is fab.</p>
<p>Something else caught our eye in their press announcements — it's called "Project Endgame". Intel say it will allow users (and developers) "to access Intel Arc GPUs through a service for an always-accessible, low-latency computing experience" and that will come at some point later this year. The keyword being users, so it's for us regular folk - but for what? Well, cloud obviously and of course the dreaded <em>Metaverse</em>.</p>
<p>In other news, Intel recently announced plans to acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 Billion. Intel say it "creates a globally diverse end-to-end foundry to help meet growing semiconductor demand and brings more value to customers across the nearly $100 billion addressable foundry market".</p>

      <title>Retro x86-based machine emulator 86Box v3.2 brings Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://86box.net/" target="_blank">86Box</a> is a new one to me but perhaps some readers might be interested in it. It's an IBM PC system emulator that specializes in running old operating systems and software. Now with <a href="http://86box.net/2022/02/16/86box-v3-2.html" target="_blank">version 3.2</a> it's available for Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2005266971645111864gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2005266971645111864gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>"This Linux version was made possible by the massive work put in by contributors like jgilje, Cacodemon345, ts-korhonen and dob205, who developed the cross-platform Qt user interface or otherwise helped with freeing our code from the shackles of Win32. This new interface should look and feel almost exactly like the old Windows one. A macOS version is also in the works, also powered by the new interface and supporting both Intel and Apple Silicon, though it wasn’t ready in time for this release."</p>
<p>What does it feature?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use interface inspired by mainstream hypervisor software</li>
<li>Low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium with focus on accuracy</li>
<li>Great range of customizability of virtual machines</li>
<li>Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981, or the more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel Architecture</li>
<li>Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards, network adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters</li>
<li>MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated Roland synthesizers</li>
<li>Supports running MS-DOS, older Windows versions, OS/2, many Linux distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and applications for these systems</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Downloads available on the <a href="https://github.com/86Box/86Box" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. They went with AppImage for Linux so it should run across most major distributions.</p>

      <title>Paradox launch a DLC subscription option for Hearts of Iron IV</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Games from Paradox Interactive after a while end up building up quite a lot of DLC, it's how they support their games for so long but it's quite daunting for new players - perhaps this new subscription for Hearts of Iron IV may help.</p>
<p>What they've done on Steam is add a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1877010/Hearts_of_Iron_IV__Expansion_Subscription/" target="_blank">Hearts of Iron IV - Expansion Subscription</a> which for a monthly, 3-monthly or yearly fee gives you access to the entire DLC collection for the game. It includes all the main expansions, plus the smaller DLC packs. Considering there's 16, it might not be a bad deal since it includes <em>all</em> future DLC. If you stop the subscription, you then lose access.</p>
<p>Paradox has no plans to switch to this style completely, as it's just an additional option available for their existing games. This isn't the first time they've added a subscription option, with Crusader Kings II also having one although that game does have quite a lot more DLC available and the base game is free.</p>
<p>Also, Paradox announced a new Career Profile screen for Hearts of Iron IV that will be available that looks something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8776283191645099134gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8776283191645099134gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can buy Hearts of Iron IV on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hearts-of-iron-iv-cadet-edition?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>How long before we see some kind of Paradox Pass to get all their games and DLC under a single subscription? I certainly wouldn't count it out.</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III to release for Linux &#39;in Early Spring&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III has just released although only supported for Windows, with the Linux release due out "in Early Spring".</p>
<p>The way it's been handled is perhaps a little confusing, if you don't fully read the Steam page. It has a SteamOS icon on Steam (to show Linux support), plus a system requirements tab at the bottom of the store page. However, down below the buy button a bit there's an Update Notes section that reads "Total War: WARHAMMER III will release on macOS and Linux in Early Spring" and the same is noted in the system requirements.</p>
<p>So if you were wanting the Feral Interactive port, you're in for a bit of a wait. We've reached out for a review code, but it's not clear if we're going to be getting one. Feral told us they "may" have keys when their version is live, and we haven't heard back elsewhere. It's possible it may run with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, which you'll probably need for cross-platform multiplayer as previous entries did not have it, a question Feral has still been dodging from us for Total War: WARHAMMER III.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>In other Feral news, their Linux port of Tomb Raider was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/tomb-raiders-linux-port-from-feral-interactive-delisted-on-steam/" target="_blank">recently delisted</a> from Steam.</p>

      <title>Fast-paced brutal FPS ULTRAKILL gets full controller support ready for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/" target="_blank">ULTRAKILL</a> might be one of the absolute most popular Early Access games from 2020 and it might just be a good pick for the Steam Deck, if you love fast-paced retro-styled shooters.</p>
<p>In the "Saw Your Heart Update" released February 16, the team mentioned they've added in full controller support to the game. This includes for all menus, tutorials and on-screen text show controller inputs, aim / look speed is no longer affected by framerate and a few other fixes to make controllers feel good. They said they're hoping for Deck Verification soon.</p>
<p>A very short but to the point teaser video was also included:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdOzarMj1IM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a40b46f9a02093acbdbb6573479a07c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdOzarMj1IM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your many movement abilities to stay mobile and avoid the relentless attacks of the dead, demons and other machines.</li>
<li>Destroy them with an arsenal of incredibly powerful weapons, each with multiple available variations.</li>
<li>Soak yourself in their blood to regain health and keep fighting.</li>
<li>Kill fast and with SSStyle to rack up combos and gain points that can be used on weapon variations between missions.</li>
<li>Master the many levels to achieve high ranks and take on unique optional challenges.</li>
<li>Explore the varied and unique campaign environments inspired by <strong>Dante's Inferno</strong> to find plentiful hidden secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering how popular ULTRAKILL is, with over 18,000 user reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive score - it would be a great one to have on the Steam Deck out of the box.</p>

      <title>PULSAR: Lost Colony gets upgrades for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The co-op spaceship crew simulator PULSAR: Lost Colony got a nice little update recently, with some of the focus being on the Linux version and being ready for the Steam Deck. <em>It's clearly all hands on Deck.</em></p>
<p>Along with fixing a bunch of bugs, the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252870/view/5892400336429733852" target="_blank">released on February 15</a> swapped out their voice chat system to use Photon Voice as a backend. This will offer better direct compatibility for Linux (they have a Native build), and they say it should also "decrease the latency in certain situations".</p>
<p>For gamepad players, they've switched to Steam Input, giving more control and it adds the ability to actually show controller buttons. Another tweak done was to better scale parts of the UI like the TAB menu, so it should be bigger and more usable now.</p>

      <title>6 years on the Vulkan API has enabled some amazing things</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can you actually believe that the Vulkan API has just crossed over the 6 year mark? Sometimes it feels like it was only yesterday. It truly has helped to create some amazing stuff while it steadily takes over from OpenGL as the cross-platform open API to use.</p>
<p>While it's true that DirectX from Microsoft is still more widely used, mostly in part due to prior developer knowledge and the majority of games being very Windows-focused, that doesn't mean Vulkan hasn't made some impressive inroads.</p>
<p>Vulkan has grown a lot in this time. It now has included vendor neutral <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/11/vulkan-ray-tracing-becomes-official-with-vulkan-12162/" target="_blank">Ray Tracing available</a>, there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/04/vulkan-video-announced-with-new-provisional-extensions-along-with-vulkan-12175-released/" target="_blank">Vulkan Video</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/vulkan-gets-new-dynamic-rendering-extension-nvidia-vulkan-beta-4706207-rolls-out/" target="_blank">Dynamic Rendering</a> and the recent release of Vulkan 1.3 pulling in more extensions properly into the standard. Major game engines now have support for it including Unity and Unreal Engine, with Godot Engine preparing their next major release that will have support for it. There's also absolutely tons of tech now supporting it too like FNA and SDL2.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest work though has been with the likes of <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a>, two implementations of various versions of Direct3D that get translated to Vulkan. They're both used with Steam Play Proton, and they're part of the secret sauce on how so many games perform well. Especially important for the Linux-powered Steam Deck, since this is what Windows games will be running through. Without Vulkan, you might never have seen a Steam Deck. Heck, <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/recommendations" target="_blank">Valve recommends</a> developers use the Vulkan API "for best performance and battery life".</p>
<p>An increasing number of games have native Vulkan rendering systems now too like Red Dead Redemption 2, Jupiter Hell, Metro Exodus, No Man's Sky, Path of Exile, the Serious Sam series, The Talos Principle, Superliminal, War Thunder and many more. Plus Valve continue adding in Vulkan to their games like Dota 2, CS:GO, Portal 2 and more using <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>.</p>
<p>We've also seen a few ports from Feral Interactive, that showed performance to be pretty good, and much better than their older OpenGL ports. This was something that excited Linux fans when it started happening, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2017/11/f1-2017-released-for-linux-as-feral-interactives-first-vulkan-only-title-heres-a-port-report/" target="_blank">with F1 2017</a> being their first port that was Vulkan-only.</p>
<p>Even on Windows, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/hirdfp/dxvk_is_amazing_on_windows/" target="_blank">some users</a> have ended up manually using the likes of DXVK in their games to improve performance. There's also Stadia, which sadly has been something of a failure for both users and Google but Vulkan did enable that to happen too.</p>
<p>There's a lot more work to do if they want to bring more developers over though. Hopefully over the next few years we'll see an increase. With the Steam Deck approaching, perhaps that might be the tipping point - one certainly can hope.</p>
<p><em>So join us in celebrating 6 years of the Vulkan API.</em></p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Sentinel Update gets &#39;specially optimised&#39; for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems if you want to do a little space exploration and building, No Man's Sky might be the place to be - with the Sentinel update out now. This brings with it enhancements for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There is of course a huge amount of other changes, but we have a special interest right now for obvious reasons. Hello Games noted that it will "support Steam Deck from launch" plus it has: a number of specific Steam Deck optimisations, support for Steam Deck controls and support for Steam Deck touch input. So they've clearly put some effort in on this one.</p>
<p>As for the content included there's multiple fierce new robotic enemies, Multi-Tool overhaul with a new Neutron Cannon weapon, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution support, a Cloaking Device, a new Exobiology Expedition, an overhaul to the combat systems, NVIDIA DLAA, more companions and the list goes on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HEJfPZPTYRA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e80f23dfb6e5b99052af891f9c1e8fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HEJfPZPTYRA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On their special update page, the title for the Steam Deck section is "Native Steam Deck Support", although it's not clear what kind of "Native" they actually mean - as right now there's still only the Windows build on Steam. It's most likely they mean supporting it through <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, just with their Deck-specific upgrades.</p>
<p>You can buy No Man's Sky from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Both stores have it with 50% off right now.</p>

      <title>XWayland 22.1 is out with DRM lease support helping VR on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XWayland, the way to run older games and applications that don't yet have native Wayland support has a brand new release out, bringing new features. XWayland is needed, as a large amount of software will take time to move from X11 to Wayland, and some might never do it.</p>
<p>As per the official version 22.1.0 <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2022-February/060924.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the mailing list, the highlights of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>DRM lease support</li>
<li>Enables sRGB fbconfigs in GLX</li>
<li>Requires libxcvt</li>
<li>Refactoring of the present code in Xwayland</li>
<li>Implements support for touchpad gestures</li>
<li>Support for xfixes's ClientDisconnectMode and optional terminate delay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The big one being DRM lease support, which we mentioned in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/xwayland-gets-drm-leasing-support-for-helping-vr-on-linux/" target="_blank">previous article</a>. One area this will really help is Virtual Reality (VR) HMDs on Linux, as developer Drew DeVault explained in a previous <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2019/08/09/DRM-leasing-and-VR-for-Wayland.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> giving some background to it all.</p>
<p>In short: it should mean that you're able to play VR games of all sorts on Wayland, when they're run through XWayland. All part of the package of ensuring everything works on Wayland, which is over the next year going to quickly expand across more distributions by default over the ageing X11.</p>

      <title>Valheim has a Beta with Steam Deck fixes, gamepad support, Frost Caves</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>All aboard the Steam Deck hype train! You want more games being upgraded? You got it! Valheim has a public Beta now available on Steam with lots of goodies. To try it out you can use the password "yesimadebackups" in the Steam Beta menu for the game, keeping in mind that it is a Beta and there are issues - try at your own peril.</p>
<p>Here's the main non-spoilery patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8"><strong>New Content:</strong></div>
* Suddenly… Frost Caves!

<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8"><strong>Fixes &amp; Improvements:</strong></div>
* Pause function in singleplayer<br/>
* Full controller support! (Gamepad legend and alternative glyphs)<br/>
* Gamepad text input when running through in steam big picture mode<br/>
* UI, settings and Steam Deck fixes<br/>
* FPS Limiter and reduced background performance<br/>
* Split dialog can take numeric input<br/>
* Signs can now be built without a workbench<br/>
* Bug fixes and quality of life improvements<br/>
* Armour stand now supports atgeirs and shield styles<br/>
* Nomap mode tweaks</blockquote>
<p>Iron Gate notes that it will force a fresh "location generation of your worlds" so expecting a longer initial load time, and you might see bosses move a little. The new Frost Caves will also only appear in unexplored areas. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11419909071645017077gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11419909071645017077gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Having a quick blast to see how well it works today and I'm genuinely surprised at just how good Valheim feels with a gamepad in hand. Really feels quite natural, and so it might end up being my preferred way to play.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to pull in impressive numbers of backers, Yacht Club Games have blasted through more stretch-goals on their crowdfunding campaign for Mina the Hollower - this includes a Linux port too.</p>
<p>Linux (and macOS) were set as goals of $800,000 and the campaign has now hit $865,000. As for why they're down as stretch-goals, the developer said "While these may seem like obvious inclusions, a lot of additional programming, testing, and support is needed to make them happen. With your generous backing, YCG will carry on the proud tradition of supporting as many platforms as we can!". Nice to see it being hit, clearly Yacht Club and their retro styled games have a lot of fans.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA upgrades their open source Image Scaling SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/nvidia-takes-on-amd-fsr-with-their-new-open-source-image-scaling/" target="_blank">Back in November 2021</a>, NVIDIA released their free and open source Image Scaling SDK for game developers to add in a spatial upscaler that can run on any modern GPU - and they've continued improving it.</p>
<p>What is it exactly? As NVIDIA describe "The NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK provides a single spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm for cross-platform support. The scaling algorithm uses a 6-tap scaling filter combined with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters, which creates nice smooth images and sharp edges. In addition, the SDK provides a state-of-the-art adaptive directional sharpening algorithm for use in applications where no scaling is required."</p>
<p>NVIDIA also say it offers the "best-in-class in comparison to scaling offered by monitors or other in-game scaling techniques" but it's nowhere near as advanced as DLSS. It's basically their simple answer to AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR).</p>
<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/NVIDIAImageScaling" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (MIT license) and just recently their team put up v1.0.2, here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added multiple performance optimizations</li>
<li>Moved edge-map the interpolation and weight computation before the directional filter response generation</li>
<li>Increased detection ratio by a factor of 2</li>
<li>Fixed host and compute shader compilation warnings</li>
<li>Adjusted sharpness minimum value and normalization</li>
<li>Updated copyright notice</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rhythm-action game Thumper gets a Steam Deck patch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The 2016 release of Thumper from developer Drool is yet another that has been tweaking for the Steam Deck, and there's a fresh patch out now ready for it.</p>
<p>What is it? "Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality. You are a space beetle. Brave the hellish void and confront a maniacal giant head from the future. Scream down the endless track and crash through punishing obstacles with simple, airtight controls. Hurtle forward, master new moves, reach overwhelming velocities, and survive epic boss battles. Every crushing impact is interwoven with a pounding original soundtrack. To reach synesthetic bliss, you must go through rhythm hell."</p>
<p>Here's what they said the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/356400/announcements/detail/4516550645597534965" target="_blank">update</a> includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues Steam Deck compatibility issues</li>
<li>Added support for PS5 and Nintendo Switch controllers</li>
<li>Adjusted trigger vibrations to feel better on Xbox Series S/X controllers</li>
<li>Fixed single frame glitch of whiteness when game starts up</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly though, the developer mentioned how it "should also let Linux users play the game via Proton (though we don't officially support that)". The strange thing about the wording, is that it's a Windows game so on the Steam Deck it would run through Proton the same as desktop Linux — because Steam Deck <em>is</em> Linux. Clarifying on the Steam forum, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/356400/eventcomments/5558008524841930566?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_#c3187989286453590840" target="_blank">said</a>: "We'll make sure it works on Steam Deck and it should, in theory, work on Linux in general but we're not in a position to officially support Linux".</p>

<p>The thing is, if something works on Steam Deck but not desktop Linux - that would be a bug in Proton that Valve would most likely solve. At least, that's what we hope Valve will continue doing.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hades from Supergiant Games is the massively popular rogue-like dungeon crawler from the creators of Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre and it should be good for the Steam Deck.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today released a huge upgrade to Proton, the compatibility layer for Linux that allows Windows games to run.</p>
<p>Proton 7.0 pulls in Wine 7.0 which it's based upon along with: upgrades to DXVK 1.9.4 for DirectX 9 / 10 / 11, newer VKD3D-Proton for DirectX 12 to Vulkan and wine-mono to 7.1.2. It also brings over some changes from Proton Experimental like performance improvements around input, windowing, and memory allocation.</p>
<p>In their official <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a>, these are listed as newly playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anno 1404</li>
<li>Call of Juarez</li>
<li>DCS World Steam Edition</li>
<li>Disgaea 4 Complete+</li>
<li>Dungeon Fighter Online</li>
<li>Epic Roller Coasters XR</li>
<li>Eternal Return</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5</li>

<li>SCP: Secret Laboratory</li>
<li>Wargroove</li>
<li>Wartales</li>
<li>Yakuza 4 Remastered</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more exciting work came in with support for <strong>Easy Anti-Cheat</strong> if the game has enabled a Linux module, support for local decoding of H264 videos, improvements to Steam Input for games using Origin, better audio in Skyrim and Fallout 4, fixes for the Paradox Launcher and a few other game specific fixes.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release on Twitter, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1493854504290119682" target="_blank">said</a>: "Proton 7.0 is now available! Highlights include playable Persona 4 Golden, audio fixes for Skyrim and Fallout games, local H264 decoding support, and the foundation for legacy EAC support. SW: Squadrons and Knockout City are currently playable with EAC, with more on the way soon!"</p>
<p>Just like they did for the BattlEye update, there's a new "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" available in the Steam client to download, along with Proton 7.0 - which you may need to restart Steam to actually see.</p>

      <title>iFixit did a teardown of the Steam Deck, official partner for parts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, Valve has confirmed that iFixit will be their official partner for getting replacement parts for the Steam Deck. Plus, there's a teardown video.</p>
<p>From the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/4347665658888576968" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope everyone’s doing well – 10 days and counting until launch day! We have some exciting news to share. If you watched our <a class="eventbbcodeparser_Link_29bMZ" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs" target="_blank">Take a look inside Steam Deck</a> video (aka the “please don’t do this” video), you may remember we said certain Steam Deck replacement parts would be available for purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we’re announcing that iFixit will be one of the authorized sellers of Steam Deck replacement parts – as well as replacement parts for the Valve Index VR kit. We are still hammering out the details, and will be sharing more info on this soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also see iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/57101/steam-deck-teardown" target="_blank">full blog post</a> for extra info.</p>
<p>Valve continued to be clearly consumer-focused with their approach to the Steam Deck. With plenty of the software being open source, releasing the CAD files and now this too. It's pretty amazing and we can't wait to see more from it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck releases on February 25.</p>

      <title>Space station management in IXION sure looks shiny in the first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bulwark Studios (Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus) have just shown off the first gameplay trailer for IXION, a game set in the far future that blends together city building, survival elements and exploration with what they claim is a thrilling space opera.</p>
<p>I got excited by this when covering it initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/ixion-is-a-city-building-survival-game-on-a-huge-moving-space-station/" target="_blank">last year</a>, now we finally get a quick look at it. I have to say, it does look pretty fantastic. Can't wait to see more from it.</p>
<p>"Following the Tiqqun’s completion of a time-skipping VOHLE jump and as Administrator for DOLOS AEC (Aerospace Engineering Corporation), the trailer showcases hull restoration, power and resource management, narrative events, station infrastructure and perilous space exploration as critical components of the assignment at hand."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AGlFvRpfiHE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ff1961242fd9974c9d82c9153d7669b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AGlFvRpfiHE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We contacted the developer today, who gave a very clear confirmation that it will support Linux.</p>
<p>You can follow IXION on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113120/IXION/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Superliminal gets the multiplayer mode hooked up for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Superliminal, the brilliant puzzle game where your perspective changes the size of things you hold to progress recently gained some multiplayer modes - and now they're on Linux too.</p>
<p>There was a delay, as it seems there were a few Unity game engine issues. Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1492186304708329481" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, porter Ethan Lee noted that for developers still on Unity 2019, they're going to want at least 2019.4.35f1 to fix up some Vulkan input lag issues. Nice to see that fix backported to an older Unity build though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z6eY5VldDeM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c5af77533978164fb94eda793ab672d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z6eY5VldDeM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Initially the multiplayer only had this strange Battle Royale styled mode, but it has since expanded with full online co-op. So you can play through the story together which sounds great.</p>
<p>Honestly this is one of my most favourite puzzle games launched in the last few years. The idea is great and its execution is close to perfection.</p>
<p>You can buy it for Linux on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>art of rally gets shown off on Steam Deck in a new video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want another close look at the Steam Deck? Here's your chance as the developer Funselektor Labs Inc. has shown off art of rally on their devkit.</p>
<p>Two things to note: not only does art of rally have a native Linux version that's worked great every time we had a race on it, it's also a Deck Verified title - this means that it's been through the official certification by Valve. This means it will work out of the box on the Steam Deck, with good performance and everything working as expected.</p>
<p>As you can see in the video below it really is looking great:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UyuIXm5nACo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4fc47e771b05fdf78a3d039186fbeac4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UyuIXm5nACo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the Steam Deck releasing next Friday, we're likely to see plenty more videos on various games and all sorts running on the Linux-powered device from Valve.</p>
<p>You can buy art of rally for Linux from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/art_of_rally?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/art-of-rally?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ABRISS is a game of deliberate total destruction and it looks brill </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ABRISS is an atmospheric physics-destruction building game. You build up huge structures, to then have them smash into other structures and it looks pretty fancy.</p>
<p>It's all about building to destroy. During the game you unlock more parts to destroy more, all set across "digital-brutalist cityscapes". Seems like there will be plenty of variety on what you can build to from rockets to giant smashing hammers that crash through everything. ABRISS is all about showing off how great you can be at making a big ol' mess.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eQ8-FtNRPQs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c168c923eb5ae034907b746480ebb414.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eQ8-FtNRPQs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>COMPLEX DESTRUCTION SYSTEM</strong> Simulated statics, thousands of little particles of debris, whole chunks of targets flying into the abyss – with little to no framerate spikes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN</strong> Five worlds with seven stages each, every stage a hand-crafted destructible cityscape. You will start each stage with a limited set of parts and you will need to find a strategy on how to use them to destroy all main target blocks. You will unlock new parts the further you progress, and every world comes with it's own special environmental mechanic. You can always return to a stage to try to destroy a higher percentage of it, or do it in less moves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SANDBOX</strong> Try out new patterns of building stuff. Play around with parts you haven't unlocked yet. Try to fryyour GPU with 1000 Lasers at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PHOTO MODE</strong> Take a free camera flying to get the best composition. Freeze or slow down time to get the perfect shot of the destruction you just caused. Apply filters to change the vibe of your photography. Export in wonderfully sharp 4k jpegs. Share them with us!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TURNAROUND GIF CAM</strong> Create your own perfectly looping turnarounds of the mayhem you cause!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Over email, the developer sent word that "Linux and Steam Deck are officially planned for the Full Release". Although the upcoming demo and Early Access builds will not. They did send over an advanced key for the upcoming demo, which appeared to work with Proton but it has a few videos that didn't play.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider&#39;s Linux port from Feral Interactive delisted on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems more Linux ports from Feral Interactive are no longer advertised on Steam, with the latest being <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203160/Tomb_Raider/" target="_blank">Tomb Raider (2013)</a>.</p>
<p>This follows on from the same happening with Mad Max and Shadow of Mordor in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/mad-max-and-shadow-of-mordor-delisted-for-linux-and-macos-on-steam/" target="_blank">Early 2021</a>. Much the same, the Linux version is no longer advertised but it is still available to install. Later that year in April 2021, Feral did bring out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/04/total-war-rome-remastered-from-feral-interactive-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Total War: ROME REMASTERED</a> but then we also saw that Feral <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/feral-no-longer-porting-a-total-war-saga-troy-to-linux-citing-less-demand-since-proton/" target="_blank">confirmed in July 2021</a>, that they would no longer be porting  A Total War Saga: TROY to Linux - citing "generally less demand for native titles since Valve’s launch of Proton".</p>
<p>Given how far things have come, the original Tomb Raider OpenGL port wasn't a particularly good show for Linux gaming. Compared with later ports that used Vulkan, it did not perform well. Seems like the port was in a rough state overall now too, checking back on it today and it wouldn't run unless forced to use the Steam Linux Runtime container and in-game there were <em>lots</em> of graphical problems on NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Currently, Feral are working on the Linux port of Total War: WARHAMMER III, which is due out for Windows on February 17 with Linux (and macOS) "in Early Spring" according to the Steam store page.</p>
<p><em>We have reached out to Feral for comments, will update if they reply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 15/02/22: Feral press replied to say "The Linux version of Tomb Raider (2013) has been removed from sale due to the license expiring for that specific title. Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are still available to purchase on Linux.".</p>

      <title>Check your Steam Library against Steam Deck compatibility easily</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to know how much of your own Steam Library is currently compatible with the Steam Deck? Well, there's now a website dedicated to doing exactly that.</p>
<p>It's called <a href="https://checkmydeck.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">CheckMyDeck</a> (great name) and all you need to do is grab your SteamID, enter it and it will do all the work for you. You can find your SteamID easily using <a href="https://www.steamidfinder.com/" target="_blank">this other website</a>. The main thing to keep in mind though, is that compatibility is an ever-changing thing, with Valve adding to the list almost daily. We <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/520-games-are-now-rated-either-verified-or-playable-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">mentioned only a few days</a> ago how Verified + Playable together hit 520 games, well as of right now it's already jumped up to 591!</p>
<p>As for CheckMyDeck, it's pretty good actually. Giving you a full list with links to each store page, along with a very tidy looking pie to give an overall score:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21080694461644917969gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21080694461644917969gol1.png"/></a><br/>
A slice of my own status right now.</em></p>
<p>Another big thing to remember is that a game being Unknown doesn't mean much - it just hasn't been tested yet, and so it might end up being a flawless experience.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 27.2 is out bringing Flatpak support and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio is the incredibly popular free and open source video capture and livestreaming software. A huge new release is now available with plenty of Linux improvements.</p>
<p>This is the first release to offer full official <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.obsproject.Studio" target="_blank">Flatpak / Flathub</a> support, which means users across pretty much any Linux distribution get any easy way to install. Not only that, because it's an official package, you also get proper service integration. For example, instead of entering a streaming key for Twitch, you can login and get all the goodies without any fuss.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14682770641644917242gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14682770641644917242gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some other big features includes support for devices from AJA Video Systems (who also open sourced their SDK and driver to help with this), an upgrade to CEF (Chromium) from 75 to 95, you have the ability to set different blend modes to sources now via the right-click menu, AOM AV1 and SVT-AV1 encoders (experimental), hotkey filter searching, hotkey for browser sources to allow refreshing a browser source via that hotkey, framework for future support of background hotkeys on Wayland, Window capture source list now sorted alphabetically on Linux, more robust PipeWire capturing and a lot more.</p>
<p>Check out the full info on GitHub.</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing work by all involved.</p>

      <title>Seems we&#39;re getting another big Terraria update soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Re-Logic clearly aren't done with Terraria, even with them previously saying they were. Liars! But we'll totally forgive them of course because we love Terraria.</p>
<p>Journey’s End was supposed to give it the finishing touches, then they did a cross-over with Don't Starve and now we're getting more. The developer has announced that Terraria 1.4.4 is on the way, bringing with it plenty of surprises. Partly in response to the game winning the "Labour of love" Award on Steam. While the new update has a lot of balance changes, we're going to see a little sprinkle of new content too. We also know they're planning some Steam Deck optimizations that they previously announced.</p>
<p>They teamed up with YouTuber ChippyGaming for a special video you can see below:</p>

<p>You can buy Terraria on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/terraria?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/terraria?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 12: In Tremendous Pain</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-11-forgotten-heresies/" target="_blank">Part 11: Forgotten Heresies</a></strong></p>
<p>In 1998 developer Raven Software acquired the rights to <em>Soldier of Fortune</em> to make a video game inspired by the mercenary magazine of the same name. The plan was to make a realistic tactical shooter, with consultant John Mullins brought in to add both his insights and likeness to the project. The final result he described as "emblematic" of the real world experience, which is a generous way of putting it. Where the controversy laid was in the game's violence.</p>
<p><em>Soldier of Fortune</em> was the first game to feature the GHOUL system, allowing for the depiction of damage to specific parts of the body, with your enemies reacting in graphic over the top ways. More pacific players might opt to instead just shoot the weapon from their hands, which is also made possible by GHOUL, but with your mission objectives often tied to eliminating all opponents on a map, such mercies are made just a block to your progress.</p>
<p>A more salient discussion could have been had on the plot of <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, steeped as it is in the doctrines of western military interventionism. It is hard to take a detached view of your actions in the game when they are taking place within the context of what were then contemporary conflicts. No matter where you stand on these issues, I think we can all agree that the cutscene where Mullins deferentially walks in on Saddam Hussein is more than a little surreal today.</p>
<p>Unlike with <em>Heretic II</em> installing <em>Soldier of Fortune</em> off the CD-ROM was a breeze, with the Loki Update tool patching the game all the way up to the <em>Gold Edition</em>. Detail textures proved to be broken with this version of my graphics drivers, and like with <em>Heretic II</em> the dynamic lighting had a significant impact on the frame rate. With those disabled the actual reported frames per second was not far off what I saw on Windows 98, but the game still felt smoother from there.</p>
<p>Feeling this I went ahead and turned down all the scalability settings in the menu for a little extra speed, with the exception of specular lighting as having it off made certain objects appear black. Setting the "gl_gentextures_broken" console variable to "1" is also supposed to fix texture issues on Linux. From there I selected a custom difficulty setting, allowing for unlimted carrying capacity and saved games, but cranking the enemy toughness up to Aggressive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13908310571644359969gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13908310571644359969gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7100754811644118902gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7100754811644118902gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Anything lower than that and your opponents tend to be pushovers, with the exception of the armour piercing snipers and mounted turret guns, which are both overpowered and too often hidden in fog no matter the difficulty. The first Siberian level is the worst for this, with the Al-Fahad oil refinery also getting a dishonourable mention. I experienced a couple hard locks at the start of the Kosovo Hanger level as well, but other than that the game remained stable.</p>
<p>Stable though is not the same as bug free. I managed to break an elevator forcing a reload at one point, and while fighting the final boss I somehow convinced Dekker to stop pursuing me, allowing me to snipe him at my leisure. The music also started to skip as if it were being played on a record player. That final area in general was a pain, with the liberal amounts of Order soldiers using Microwave Pulse Guns slowing the game to a crawl.</p>
<p>While those are the most esoteric weapons found in the game, they are all fun to use and have applications in different situations. Some are better at piercing armour, some are better at taking enemies out at a distance, while others deliver more of a punch up close. My only real complaint is that Mullins throws grenades straight without any kind of arc, causing them to often be more lethal to me than any of the opposition.</p>
<p>In many ways <em>Soldier of Fortune</em> was ahead of its time, bearing a closer resemblance to the military shooters that would come to dominate in the decade after its release. The game teaches you to lean from cover while fighting what are for the most part human hitscan wielding enemies, all while battling through a mostly linear and highly scripted campaign. Given that Raven Software is now a close partner of Infinity Ward, it perhaps was a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Every 3D accelerated game I have covered so far has used some variation of the <em>Quake</em> engine, being made by either Raven Software or by id Software themselves. This has meant I have been playing on friendly ground, as id Software were always a booster of OpenGL, which on Linux is the only graphics API supported by my Rage 128 Pro card. I think it is time to move into more hostile territory, and play a game that was very much optimized for Glide instead.</p>

      <title>Children of Morta gets online co-op in the Fellowship Sanctuary update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Children of Morta is easily one of the best looking pixel-art games around, and the gameplay is pretty awesome too. Now you can team up with a friend as the online co-op update is out.</p>
<p>"Children of Morta is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development, where you don’t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary family of heroes. Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption."</p>
<p>The Fellowship Sanctuary free update brings the new mode to both the Story and Family Trials modes. Sounds like this is the final update to the game too. Nothing else was mentioned that came with the update, so it's not clear if it fixes up any issues elsewhere.</p>

      <title>Check out Rise of the Third Power if you love JRPG styled games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rise of the Third Power is a brand new release from Stegosoft Games and DANGEN Entertainment, the same team who previously released the popular Ara Fell: Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>This was first shown off back in 2017, a throwback to the SNES era of RPGs but of course built for modern audiences with plenty of up to date convenience features thrown in. That, plus a mix of designs inspired by JRPGs and more western elements too. In the game you build up a party of up to eight unique characters, with each having their own background story, ambitions, and personalities, as they embark upon a suicide mission to prevent a war and topple the Arkadyan emperor. A blend of humour, drama and tragedy await you in a 35+ hour story-focused quest as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6STgUppJIPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/129e6c48a221d8fd9fbc892156712f55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6STgUppJIPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“What matters more than anything is making our games with love. We didn’t think we could do that more than we did in Ara Fell, but we hope it shines through all the same in Rise of the Third Power,” says Stegosoft Games.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>STORY DRIVEN</strong> - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin.</li>
<li><strong>POLITICAL INTRIGUE</strong> - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history.</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM</strong> - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle.</li>
<li><strong>PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT</strong> - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The release arrived with day-1 native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/rise_of_the_third_power" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/rise-of-the-third-power?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698700/Rise_of_the_Third_Power/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA fix up a Vulkan problem with the v510.54 driver release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA decided Linux gamers need a little love on Valentines Day so they put up a small driver release for you.</p>
<p>In comparison to previous drivers, it's not going to make any big headlines. There's no big new features, no new Vulkan extensions or performance improvements. Instead, there's quite an essential bug fix included.</p>
<p>The single change noted in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/187033/en-uk" target="_blank">510.54 driver release</a> is "Fixed a bug that could cause GPU exceptions when minimizing a fullscreen Vulkan application on certain desktops, such as Plasma.". So if you found Vulkan games and applications causing you some major fuss on Linux with KDE Plasma (as just one example), perhaps this new driver is exactly what you're looking for.</p>
<p>NVIDIA only put up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/nvidia-5104703-is-out-adding-vulkan-13-geforce-rtx-3050-support/" target="_blank">version 510.47.03</a> about two weeks ago, which gave us Vulkan 1.3 support. That built on top of a previous Beta version, so it was actually quite a big release overall anyway adding new extension support and biggies like Vulkan Dynamic Rendering.</p>

      <title>Send help as I have discovered Super Auto Pets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sent in by a reader a while ago and one I've been meaning to try out properly, Super Auto Pets is a free to play auto-battler from Team Wood Games that's delightfully good. A game that's annoyingly moreish, as you're going to want to play through just one more run.</p>
<p>Auto-battling probably doesn't need much of an introduction: you carefully build up a team of creatures, then proceed to turn-based battles that happen automatically without your direct input. In between each round you go back to the preparation area to sell creatures, level them up, buy new more advanced creatures or perhaps give them an extra bonus or two. Then it's back to battling and repeat. Here the battles are one-dimensional though, so your positioning is a vital part of the strategy as they will fight at the front until one is down, then the next and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ggRELN8KyHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/768da89677feb9b0bae2064e36e94e40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ggRELN8KyHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Play across two different modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arena mode, asynchronous match ups, no turn timer! Can you reach 10 medals?</li>
<li>Versus mode, match up against X other players, can you come out on top?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Super Auto Pets is really quite great actually. Very chilled-out, go at your own pace - I love it. Native Linux support is offered too built with the Unity game engine, and it seems to work without issues. Clearly the developer is onto something here with is regularly seeing well over 7,000 peak-player counts on Steam each day.</p>
<p>It does have in-app purchases, although it's not of the pay to win kind. You can buy an expansion, to then play that with other players who also have it. There's also some background and hats you can buy as fluff, to support the game. Seems pretty sane to me.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714040/Super_Auto_Pets/" target="_blank">free to play on Steam</a> and in your browser <a href="https://teamwood.itch.io/super-auto-pets" target="_blank">on itch.io</a> too.</p>

      <title>Welcome to Elk readies up for the Steam Deck and Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A biographical adventure set on an island like no other, Welcome to Elk from developer Triple Topping has a new update available that aims to make the experience on Linux with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and the Steam Deck better.</p>
<p>Something a lot of developers will likely have to do is fix up text scaling for the Steam Deck, since the resolution and smaller screen can end up making certain games unreadable. This is one of the major changes in Welcome to Elk with text scaling added throughout the whole game, that you can tweak in the options menu. The developer has also enabled Steam Cloud save syncing, performance improvements, an icon when saving, and a few bug fixes like videos not playing through Proton on Linux.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hgcfQjN-oQc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2fa684689a102bfa5414902ce6cb5d8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hgcfQjN-oQc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You play as Frigg, a young carpenter traveling to Elk for an apprenticeship. She is used to an outgoing and hectic lifestyle in the city. How will she handle the isolated life on Elk with only few young people around her and no internet?</p>
<p>On Elk, Frigg and you will meet the weird and wonderful characters – people whom the world has either ignored or forgotten. Follow their ups and downs, their odd drinking rituals and their unique ways of tackling whatever life throws at them. Here it’s known that humour, love and death go hand in hand. Life may seem hard sometimes, but it is always followed by laughter.</p>
<p>We value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and share them. That’s why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who inspired us to make this game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A narrative game based on tales of real stories told by real people.</li>
<li>Mini games that are deeply connected to the game and story.</li>
<li>An endearing and lovable cast of characters to explore.</li>
<li>Humorous and beautiful hand drawn artstyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015940/Welcome_to_Elk/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Doom Shinobi is my new favourite GZDoom mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again, Doom modders doing their thing making crazy things happen with GZDoom. A newly released mod called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-shinobi" target="_blank">Doom Shinobi</a> appeared recently and it's quite something.</p>
<p>Built for Doom II with GZDoom, this mod offers a new perspective on battling the hordes in third-person. You get to run, jump, slash, do combo moves and unleash various powers. This is only the initial release, with plenty more planned to be added over time. Check out the first official trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6ec6FHhHDII"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f37b458d1ca6eb7db5d1462963d88af3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6ec6FHhHDII" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer plans to add in across various updates: more weapons, executions and fatalities and eventually a full and complete map pack to go along with it.</p>
<p>Running it on Linux is easy. Simply download the initial release from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-shinobi" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>, stick the <em>pak</em> file into your GZDoom folder which is usually somewhere like <code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom</code> and then run it with <code class="inline-code">gzdoom -file doomShinobi.v1.pk3</code> or use your favourite launcher.</p>

      <title>Vulkan post-processing layer vkBasalt gets a few tweaks in v0.3.2.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vulkan post-processing layer <a href="https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt" target="_blank">vkBasalt</a> allows Linux gamers to run various visual enhancement features, along with support for running various Reshade Fx shaders. A fantastic project that can really bring new life to older games, or to improve newer games that have a lack of good graphical tweaking options.</p>
<p>Recently the developer put up version 0.3.2.5 with these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>micro optimized some shaders</li>
<li>added a new enableOnLaunch config option</li>
<li>fixed crash when the swapchain was created before vkGetDeviceQueue was called</li>
<li>fixed build on gcc12 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Current effects that come with vkBasalt include: Contrast Adaptive Sharpening, Denoised Luma Sharpening, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing, Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing and a 3D colour LookUp Table.</p>
<p>Want help using it? You can try out the <a href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay" target="_blank">GOverlay</a> app which works with MangoHud, vkBasalt and ReplaySorcery.</p>

      <title>520 games are now rated either Verified or Playable for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we hit less than two weeks until the Steam Deck launch on February 25, Valve appear to be doing well on the testing front with 520 games now either fully Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Each day now a good bunch seem to trickle in together. At this rate of progress per-day, we're perhaps going to see close to 1,000 either Verified or Playable by launch. That is, unless this is all still early testing of their processes and we might see a bigger bump closer to launch which is entirely possible. Either way, it's already a rather nice number. The amount only tells so much though, quality over quantity of course and there's a lot of good picks already.</p>
<p>The totals currently are 309 Verified, 211 Playable and 60 Unsupported. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-verified-jumps-over-200-titles/" target="_blank">Two days ago</a> there were only 243 Verified!</p>

<p>The big thing to remember is that any of this can change before launch, it's not a final list and games can be updated at any time to change their rating. That's true now and will be so after release.</p>
<p>For the Unsupported list, there's a few now noted due to the anti-cheat not supporting Linux / Proton like: Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and Back 4 Blood.</p>
<p>You can see the lists easily on the unofficial SteamDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">Verified</a></li>
<li><a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">Playable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Unsupported" target="_blank">Unsupported</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the useful ProtonDB website (also unofficial) that tracks Proton compatibility for the whole of Linux had some upgrades lately like a very handy <a href="https://www.protondb.com/explore?selectedFilters=antiCheat" target="_blank">Anti-Cheat list</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve releases Steam Deck shell CAD files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helping to build a huge community around the upcoming Steam Deck handheld, Valve has helpfully released the CAD files for the external shell.</p>
<p>As Valve said on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1492259379004854273" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it's "Good news for all the tinkerers, modders, accessory manufacturers, or folks who just want to 3D print a Steam Deck to see how it feels: We've published CAD files of the external shell for download", to which amusingly dbrand replied with "So... no C&amp;D then?" (C&amp;D being Cease and Desist) since they announced their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-previews-are-up-plus-dbrand-announce-project-killswitch/" target="_blank">Project Killswitch</a> case.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4490703321644622371gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4490703321644622371gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Valve did similar for the Steam Controller back in 2016. Hopefully with this move, we will see a much bigger tinkering community spring up around it. They continue to show just how much more open they are when compared with the likes of Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.</p>
<p>The files are on <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/SteamDeck/hardware" target="_blank">their own GitLab</a> under the Creative Commons license.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.2 spilled out with the beginnings of a WMA decoder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The dedicated team building up the Windows compatibility layer Wine have release a new development version with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.2" target="_blank">Wine 7.2</a> now available. This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's the highlights of the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>  Large scale cleanup to support 'long' type with MSVCRT.</li>
<li>  Mono engine updated to version 7.1.1.</li>
<li>  More theming fixes in common controls.</li>
<li>  Beginnings of a WMA decoder.</li>
<li>  Support for 64-bit time_t.</li>
<li>  Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As per usual the bug fixes are a big assorted bunch, since Wine has to fix up compatibility with a never ending amount of Windows applications and games from a great many years ago to modern stuff. This time only 23 were tagged as fixed as of this release including issues with Half-Life (CD version), Call of Juarez and other miscellaneous applications.</p>
<p>No new issue of World Wine News as of yet though, it will probably come along later with a little more info into recent ongoings in Wine land.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi building and crew management sim Space Haven Alpha 14 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Haven from Bugbyte Ltd. continues building up towards something truly special with it blending together spaceship building, exploration and crew management. Alpha 14 is out now with lots of new goodies. <u>Note</u>: if you already own it and plan on diving back in, the developer said to start a new game.</p>
<p>There's a huge amount of changes in this one including a smarter AI, that's more lenient on lower difficulty modes. The ability the customize your starting crew, more strategic options available in ship-to-ship combat, a rework of the crew comfort system split across Work / Leisure / Sleep, the beginnings of a total rework of the power distribution system to be less confusing, new stuff to build like an auto-turret and a small shield and the list just goes on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14749998661644586296gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14749998661644586296gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - The "HSS CALL ME CRAZY", one of the many derelicts you can find and explore.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, Space Haven was just recently rated as "Playable" for the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>. For it to get up to "Verified" it would need better gamepad support and not needing you to manually invoke the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>Seems it's managed to get quite a few fans, as it has now a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 4,000 players.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/space-haven?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/space_haven?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roma Invicta is a like an indie Total War out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Like the idea of Total War games but find them complicated or want something similar that takes a bit less time? Roma Invicta is a new indie release that looks promising.</p>
<p>"In Roma Invicta you have the honor of conquering ancient Gaul with your Roman legions. The game combines action oriented real-time battles with turn-based strategy on the campaign map where you raise, supply and move your armies.<br/>
The game can best be described as a mixture of the old Amiga classic 'North and South' and the 'Total War' series."</p>
<p>The developer mentioned they've tried to keep it reasonably historically accurate, and battles will leave a lasting impression on the environment with fallen soldiers, arrows sticking around, craters from cannon fire and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ej6F33hGgV8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea44ed4c5a444d8c9fb3132f59bde63d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ej6F33hGgV8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience a lovingly handcrafted scenery of ancient Gaul.</li>
<li>Recruit your troops from legionnaires to scorpion artillery to Germanic cavalry.</li>
<li>Fight in tactical and action-packed real-time battles with hundreds of individual soldiers.</li>
<li>Slow down or pause the battle to always stay in control and give orders with no hurry.</li>
<li>Hand over parts of your army to the AI​​ to always keep control even in larger battles.</li>
<li>Supply your troops and always pay attention to the changing of the seasons.</li>
<li>You decide whether to bring peace to the Gallic villages or whether to plunder them and thus further ignite the resistance against you.</li>
<li>Different starting conditions and difficulty levels ensure replay value.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1878070/Roma_Invicta/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Come get a good look at the Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Heart of Russia DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Heart of Russia is the next big expansion for the incredibly popular trucking sim from SCS Software. The team previously showed off plenty of shots from it, however this is our first proper look at it and SCS certainly aren't holding back now with a 20 minute preview of trucking from Vyazma to Kaluga.</p>
<p>It's still a work in progress and SCS aren't yet ready to say when it will release.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QAc8ywOonq8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bb035030bfd06199f7fdbcd7e80da1a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QAc8ywOonq8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For more info behind the scenes, you can also check out a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/227300/view/3102418998215647381" target="_blank">development post</a> where SCS talked about important world markers. These special structures come in two forms with Entrance Monuments and Region Signs, each of them designating a new area in the game, so once you see them coming up you know you're officially entering their administrative area. Here's an example:</p>

      <title>CitySlicker is an upcoming high-end case for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck releasing on February 25, we're starting to see more of a build-up around it from all areas. Not just games but accessories now too like the CitySlicker carrying case from WaterField Designs.</p>
<p>This is what they say is a high-end case, that was designed as a result of feedback they gathered from other 1,200 members of their community. Made to look good as well as be functional, there's quite a lot to like about this - although, it does look perhaps a bit overly business-like.</p>
<p>It has space for the Steam Deck, a USB-C Cable, SD Cards, Earbuds, a HDMI cable and space enough they say to comfortably fit in an Anker PowerCore+ 20100 for charging on the go. Coming in 8 different colours, it's made with what they say natural full-grain leather with "no skimping" on the details.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4YESj5-D7uU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d2af16ba287b876cec07ee451c80b0fd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4YESj5-D7uU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Pre-orders open at 6 PM PST February 17th / 2 AM UTC February 18. According to their delivery page they offer international shipping. Likely won't be cheap either but for protecting your Steam Deck, it's probably best to not compromise on quality while you're lugging it around eh? No price has been revealed but going by their other products like their similar Switch case it goes for $88 - so that should give you a vague idea.</p>

      <title>Mask of the Rose from Failbetter Games has a demo up now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mask of the Rose is a new mixture of a dating sim with a little murder and detective work, set in the popular Fallen London Universe from Failbetter Games.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of dating-sim visual novel types, this is not another Anime-styled game pushing scantily clad characters in your face. Instead, it uses the wonderful gothic underworld style that Failbetter are known for with Fallen London, Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies. They're taking a different approach to it too, as it's not all about you. While you can go out and look for everlasting love, you can also choose to be a matchmaker and remain unattached and all storylines remain accessible either way you go.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Vzt2XceW-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f17eb5cabf22ce48f415e3a305d5beb1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Vzt2XceW-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(Re)invent yourself: who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?</li>
<li>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories to unlock different story options</li>
<li>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners, each with their own secrets</li>
<li>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself (by any definition you like)</li>
<li>Write love stories in a delightful minigame, and use them to impress the new Masters</li>
<li>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources. How are you at rat catching?</li>
<li>Solve the first murder since the Fall, with the assistance of the victim</li>
<li>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London</li>
<li>Seek deeper and deeper secrets over multiple playthroughs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Another title that was funded via Kickstarter, it's good to see official Linux support has not only stuck around but available so early on with a Demo available for play-testing right now.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769980/Mask_of_the_Rose/" target="_blank">on Steam now</a>. Be sure to let us know what you think in the comments if you try the demo!</p>

      <title>Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG released for Linux plus gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another native Linux build arrives. This time we have Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG from Dark Crystal Games. Not only have they released it for Linux, they've also now hooked up gamepad support and so it should end up working quite nicely on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"A tactical sci-fi RPG set in a dystopian environment allowing you to fight enemies, explore the hostile wasteland, level up your character and join one of the factions – made up of survivors - in the shattered world and cut off from the rest of society.</p>
<p>Enrolling in one of the five wings of the CRONUS Corporation - each with its own features, mechanics and game options - and embark on a one way trip inside the Dome in the quest for unique artifacts as you avoid radiation, anomalies and a whole host of creatures out to do you harm."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Eyq31os4VDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9094d728ed8f47491c932f858c06fc4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Eyq31os4VDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about the update the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have long promised to add gamepad support to the game and spent a lot of time and effort on its implementation. Additional options have been added along with the gamepad and now you can adjust the font size - or enable high contrast mode – which will make the game more accessible to play on a large monitor or TV. Or, for that matter, on a small Steam Deck display.<br/>
<br/>
We also released a Linux version of the game and fixed a lot of bugs, errors and polished some minor rough edges – the fixes were so numerous that we decided not to make a list at all this time. Believe us, you will still see enough of them, because we do not plan to abandon Encased, and in the near future a lot of new and interesting things await you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This was a crowdfunded title, so it's nice to tick another off <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/crowdfunders/" target="_blank">from our big list</a>.</em></p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/encased-a-scifi-postapocalyptic-rpg?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/921800/Encased_A_SciFi_PostApocalyptic_RPG/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/encased_a_scifi_postapocalyptic_rpg" target="_blank">GOG</a> does have a Linux build too they just don't say so.</p>

      <title>XCOM 2 gets a Free Weekend plus a MASSIVE discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XCOM 2 is still to this day one of my absolute favourite strategy games, and now you can experience it free for a whole weekend and get it cheap if you want to continue with it. This is celebrating six years since XCOM 2 first released, which came with a Linux port from Feral Interactive.</p>
<p>For the Free Weekend on Steam, you have from now until February 14 to download and play. The good news is that the base game has a <u>94%</u> discount making it a ridiculous £2.10. On top of that, the XCOM 2 Collection Bundle also has 94% off which gives you multiple DLC and the War of the Chosen expansion which is a huge extension to the game that I consider essential (but masses of fun without it).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421316181644572036gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421316181644572036gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/268500/XCOM_2/" target="_blank">Head over to Steam</a> for the deal and join the fun of missing those 99% accurate shots.</p>
<p>It also forms part of the current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/2kpublishersale2022" target="_blank">2K Publisher game sale</a> on Steam where you can save on Borderlands, Civilization and plenty more quality titles.</p>

      <title>Get ready to sweat with VR rhythm game Groove Gunner out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Got the moves? Have a VR kit at the ready? Groove Gunner from BitCutter Studios Inc has released from Early Access today and it's one you might get a little hot with.</p>
<p>It's a rhythm game, in a vaguely similar way to Beat Saber except here you've got guns and shield. You also don't cut through anything but have to shoot targets at a specific time and point, while also blocking incoming glowing balls. A thoroughly challenging game, and a pretty excellent workout. The tunes it comes with are pretty damn great too, as the developer teamed up with a bunch of indie artists with a varied genre set.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ymiVSI6718w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c9e2f979036942e7c2ac11a1ee4afde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ymiVSI6718w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You also get access to a feature-rich song editor, plus an in-game browser to download custom tunes that people put up. This is kind of needed though, as there's not exactly many tracks included in the game officially. There's also a few tricks for anyone interested in livestreaming it including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>LIV support</strong> to use avatars and custom camera angles.</li>
<li><strong>Groove Overlay</strong> is a customizable UI that shows your audience everything from your previous high score to your combo meter.</li>
<li><strong>Groove Cam</strong> unlocks first person options such as camera stabilization, FOV and rotation lock.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Groove Cam</strong> allows players to watch you from a variety of angles while you groove to the music.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving it a valiant effort (if I do say so myself), here's a run I had earlier which made use of the Groove Cam to give you a slightly better view of what was going on:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sWHNXjq35xo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf2f335c62712646e10193d121b449cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sWHNXjq35xo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You really need some top-tier god-like hand-eye coordination for this one, and a love of music of course. A very easy recommendation though as it's thoroughly entertaining, sweat producing and body aching - pretty much exactly what you want in a rhythm game for VR isn't it? Their native Linux version seems perfectly smooth and it's quite a rarity to see a VR game have one.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976930/Groove_Gunner/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>OlliOlli World is ridiculously good fun and works great with Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to Kickflip, Heelflip and Ollie your way to becoming a master and impress the skating godz? OlliOlli World is out and it works right away on Linux with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play</a> Proton Experimental. Note: it requires a gamepad to play.</p>
<p>The third in the series, and the first to not offer a native Linux build. A shame it's not officially supported by the developer, but Valve's work with the Proton compatibility layer continues providing. This was an out of the box, day-1 working title with Proton.</p>
<p>A first for the series is the switch to a much more stylized 3D look, and it's thoroughly weird through and through. Much like the two previous though, the basic idea remains the same with you tearing it up down a path like a platformer, while you do tricks and avoid hazards. It's all simple to do, although building up a good combo can be quite difficult as it's a very fast-paced game. It's nothing like other skateboarding games, at all.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d9FCJFnPWGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce9aca656c0015786838e5402e795f3e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d9FCJFnPWGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “OlliOlli World lives and breathes the diversity, freedom, and fun that is essential to skateboarding,” said Simon Bennett, Co-Studio Head at Roll7. “Because the notion of inclusiveness and expressivity is so intimately connected with skateboarding, we wanted Radlandia to be a welcoming place for everyone.”</p>
<p>Welcoming it is too, with the character customization left incredibly open to show off whoever you are or want to be. Mixing and matching pretty much anything is possible and you can come out with some pretty funky looking characters. I will admit that I took a good 20 minutes to craft my character, after going through all the options. That's only the beginner set too, you unlock plenty more to customize your look as you skate.</p>
<p>Not only do you customize your look but your skateboarding style can be slightly tweaked too. You can pick a couple different starting and ending poses, the way you grab your deck and then you get to customize your actual board too. Lots to love there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13747736531644490202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13747736531644490202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To describe OlliOlli World a good comparison would be something like: skateboarding merged with the silliness of Adventure Time. In terms of style and overall wackiness, it definitely to me seems like a pretty apt way to describe it. A bunch of skateboarding godz created various areas to skate, and some wizard that oversees it all wants to retire so you're gunning for their job. It's a wild ride.</p>
<p>OlliOlli World is pretty much a reinvention of the game, one that was needed too as the first two were already quite similar. It feels super fresh and inviting and for fans of high-score chasing, this is a quality game to go and pick up that you can have hours of fun with at a time. Thanks to the new 3D perspective, it's not just an enhancement in looks but in mechanics too. Tracks are more varied, and twist around each other with different lanes you can switch between for more of a challenge, plus the later tracks steadily get complicated as you ride up ramps between sections and grind between repeating gaps. It's pretty full-on.</p>
<p>Some Linux gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0fYqgkGuvEo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/faaacd70b5bb04a48b6feadbc2be85e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0fYqgkGuvEo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While there is a story and it's definitely up there in the gnarly category, OlliOlli World is all about pulling off slick tricks. There's over 30 main tricks you can do, add to that a number of different ways to grind your deck and all the combos you can do together and there's a really big variety here. Learning them all takes a lot of time too so climbing those leaderboards certainly won't be easy. However, OlliOlli World is far simpler to get into than what came before and so it's a lot more fun overall.</p>
<p>A fantastic game to just pick up and blast through and to keep coming back to smash those high-scores.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/olliolli-world?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190170/OlliOlli_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Skul: The Hero Slayer gets a massive overhaul out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Skul: The Hero Slayer, one of the best sellers on Steam from 2021 recently passed the 1 million mark and a big balancing overhaul update is out now. It's an impressive number for SouthPAW Games, with this being their first published title. Considering the competition for similar side-scrolling action rogue-lites, it's even more impressive.</p>
<p>You take on the role of a skeleton, Skul, with a very unique ability. You can swap your current head for another, gaining the abilities from that head and swap them around during fights. It's actually pretty great, although they've needed some time to get the balancing right on them all. What they've called the Skul Reformation Update is out now, trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MSSQfjYKbig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15a2efb63547ac183bd229a2c4ac7e5c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MSSQfjYKbig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Far too many changes to list here, the gist is that over 20 skulls have been redone with balancing changes and some had a complete mechanical overhaul on their abilities. That plus a large number of bug fixes.</p>
<p>The developer, still, hasn't solved one issue though. The native Linux version has a black screen instead of an intro video and main menu. However, simply adding "-force-vulkan" as a launch option makes it work perfectly. It's quite annoying they've left it so long but the fix is very simple at least.</p>
<p>You can buy Skul: The Hero Slayer on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/skul-the-hero-slayer?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147560/Skul_The_Hero_Slayer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Party-based dungeon crawling RPG &#39;Escape The Mad Empire&#39; looks awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for a big mixed bag of genres? Escape The Mad Empire is an upcoming pixel-art game that combines elements of dungeon crawling, roguelikes, tactical battles and a little base building too.</p>
<p>Featuring real-time combat with an instant-action on pause system, they say it gives the speed of real-time while allowing for some precision to control spells and skills like a turn-based RPG would. The combat in it sounds nice and deep too with cover, flanking, terrain differences, surface area covering affecting you (water, fire, ice etc) plus there's going to be a ton of items, status effects and much more they say will lead to "emerging gameplay and a rich, non-repetitive, dramatic and intense experience". Check out their announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sR81ssLm90w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65f68728e63250dc29552845748a77b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sR81ssLm90w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the main core of the experience will be the dungeon crawling combat, there's plenty outside of that too as you will be building up your team and home base between missions too. Recruit new people, train them up, craft or buy items and more. Sounds like it has a bit of everything.</p>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email, they confirmed Linux support is planned and they're using the Unity game engine, so hopefully they won't see much trouble. They're saying it's going to hit Early Access likely next year, so it's a good while away yet.</p>
<p>You can wishlist / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823390/Escape_The_Mad_Empire/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Creative Assembly show off online play for Total War: WARHAMMER III</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is due for release on February 17, with a Linux port from Feral Interactive due sometime soon after and we now have the first footage of online play.</p>
<p>CA say that WARHAMMER III is "bigger than ever" with more game modes and players available than previous entries in the series. For up to 8 players you can play through these campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">Realm of Chaos (8 Players): Warhammer 3’s standard campaign, where up to eight players can join forces or battle for surpremacy.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">Darkness &amp; Disharmony (8 Players): Play to bring about Grand Cathay's salvation...or its destruction.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">Something Rotten in Kiselv (3 Players): A smaller adventure with higher stakes for each player!</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cFGT5MKWofE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6746b901b11150849c3d6ce3e261e378.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cFGT5MKWofE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer also included a few other key bullet-point details about how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All players may take their turns simultaneously—act fast to outrun your opponents!</li>
<li>Enjoy a slower, more thoughtful pace? You can choose to take sequential turns in the options.</li>
<li>Players enter as spectators during battles, where they can be granted forces to control of their own!</li>
<li>Hold no allegiances to either side? Play the mercenary and commandeer troops from either army. (Imposters and traitors are most welcome!)</li>
<li>Gift regions of the map to your allies to keep them in the fight!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, just recently CA put up a new video to go over the Corruption Feature. Total War: WARHAMMER III has this feature reworked, which they say makes it more interesting and splits it off into five different types. Factions are affected by it differently, with certain servants getting a buff but a negative effect for your regular mortals. What you'll see is a boost to your overall Control from the Corruption that follows a specific faction and the opposite for other types. There's a fair bit more to it, check the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I04eDv96CgM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78257548d4f256b7be7ddcdf3749e887.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I04eDv96CgM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a reminder: if you do pre-order (or buy in the first week after release) you will get access to an additional free Race Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER III with the Ogre Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Feral Interactive who are doing the Linux port have so far ignored our emails asking for information on cross-platform multiplayer in their version, so we fully expect it to <em>not</em> have online play with the Window build.</p>
<p>You can pre-order from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Developer of Netherguild looking for Alpha testers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Netherguild is an upcoming turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawler that will be offering native Linux support, and you can try out the Alpha version right now. Long-time readers might recognise it, as we covered it initially quite early on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/netherguild-a-promising-team-based-turn-based-strategy-about-adventuring-deep-underground/" target="_blank">back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>With blocky graphics backed up by some great looking lighting, you command various expeditions below the surface as you attempt to find a cure for a plague. Explore, camp and fight on as far as you can before heading back to resupply. As you explore and see more, the overworld will change with you featuring various events.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7639360561644484879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7639360561644484879gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roguelite with Persistence and Story:</strong> Keep your characters at the end of each expedition (if they survive), equip them with powerful items and level them up over time. Netherguild's story progresses the more you explore and find out about the secrets of its world.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling Resource Management:</strong> Powerful abilities have a limited amount of uses. Your characters have limited inventory space. What is more important? The priceless loot you bring up back to the surface, or the firewood logs that let you descend even deeper?</li>
<li><strong>Original Game World:</strong> Netherguild may be fantasy, but don't expect it to play by genre conventions at all; No Orcs, no Elves, and no wizards casting fireballs. Expect to find strange biospheres and denizens far underground.</li>
<li><strong>Cute Voxel Aesthetics:</strong> Contrasted by a story with serious themes, as you face against plague and conspiracy!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can grab the Alpha right now from <a href="https://superobot1.itch.io/netherguild" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1464220/Netherguild/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Eggnut decide not to bring Backbone to Linux officially</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2018, developer Eggnut released their post-noir narrative adventure Backbone in June 2021. Sadly, they've decided not to go through with the official Linux support on it.</p>
<p>This is a crowdfunding campaign that did very clearly have Linux down as a platform from the beginning, so it's not the best of looks. Especially to get the announcement that it's no longer planned <em>eight months</em> after the initial launch. What's the reasoning being given? Here's what they said in the Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/106061903/backbone-pixel-art-detective-adventure-inspired-by/posts/3426541" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're very sorry to announce that we won't be porting Backbone to Linux in the near future. We did our best to do it in-house, but it took immeasurable amount of time and effort, and making it work properly would require creating a dev environment to work in which we don't have the resources for because we're deep in production for our next game. We are not in the financial position to hire another party to do the porting for us. We absolutely understand the frustration these news might bring, and we're ready to offer you these solutions:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For backers, they've offered a key for any other platform <strong>or</strong> a <em>full</em> refund if you prefer. That is at least a lot better than some, as we've seen plenty of other projects decide not to do Linux after including it in funding and not offer anything. Still, it's a frustrating situation, <em>especially</em> to be told they don't have a development environment set up for it — after being in development overall for multiple years and already being supported on Windows for over half a year.</p>
<p>What about <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, can you run it there? Reports seem mixed on it, although there's not many, with the big problem being cinematics not playing.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Verified jumps to over 240 titles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Each day we're stepping ever close to the Steam Deck releasing and it seems Valve's testing is beginning to speed up, with now well over 200 titles now fully Steam Deck Verified. Around <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/over-120-titles-are-now-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">6 days ago</a>, it was only at 120.</p>
<p>The actual number is 243 according to the unofficial <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> tracker. An impressive amount of course though, one that absolutely dwarfs any of the modern console launches from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo and it's only going to get bigger before release.</p>

<p>If you include titles only tagged by Valve as "Playable", so they should still run but they will have certain issues from text that's too small to a single-player gaming needing online activation - there's 412 you can expect to see running out of the box.</p>
<p>What game are you hoping to see gets fixed up and Deck Verified ready for release? Do let us know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Tim Sweeney has a point about Fortnite EAC support</title>
      <author>Samsai</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the big topics of discourse in the Linux gaming sphere recently has been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/epic-games-ceo-says-a-clear-no-to-fortnite-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Tim Sweeney's statement on porting Fortnite to the Steam Deck</a>, where Sweeney argues that Linux would be too difficult of a target and the market not big enough to warrant the amount of resources it would take to bring all of Fortnite on the platform.</p>
<p>The central crux of the issue, from Sweeney's point of view, is that making Easy Anti-Cheat, with all of its capabilities, run on Steam Deck (and thus on Linux) would be extremely difficult. He argues, that for a game of Fortnite's size this would open the flood-gates to significant influx of cheaters.</p>
<p>There have been some responses to this from the Linux side, with some accusing Sweeney of exaggerating the difficulty of such a port or that his statements are conflicting, because he simultaneously believes the Linux market is too small to be worthwhile but also would provide a way for too many cheaters. I will address some of these aspects a bit later, but for now let's focus on the main technical blocker, which is Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>Easy Anti-Cheat, or EAC, is an anti-cheat solution which apparently comes in a few configurations. We know that it can be run in a configuration where it is compatible with Linux/Proton apparently with just a relatively simple toggle. However, this mode of operation is seemingly a comparatively high-trust configuration, where only part of the anti-tampering protections of EAC are active. This may prevent some cheats but fail to detect others, which can be perfectly reasonable for games, where the number of cheaters and potential cheaters are fairly low or other systems complement the anti-cheat solution. There are plenty of games, even some popular free-to-play titles, which at best have this level of anti-tamper protection and they don't seem to have a major cheating epidemic, so clearly in many cases this should be enough. We also don't know the scope of cheats that are detected by EAC in this configuration, so this system by itself may already be fairly comprehensive.</p>
<p>EAC also contains a kernel-level component, which on Windows is installed as a kernel driver. This allows EAC code to run at a very privileged level and inspect essentially any and all parts of the system in order to detect tampering. This provides a very broad level of monitoring, which is also harder to bypass. Based on Sweeney's comments, this is the mode of operation used by Fortnite. It is also a mode of operation that is technically incompatible with the Linux way of doing things.</p>
<p>In Linux, the standard way of delivering drivers is by submitting the driver into the kernel source code tree, which naturally requires that the driver be open source. Most drivers are delivered this way, where the driver gets tightly integrated into the kernel and the drivers are updated when the kernel is updated. There are of course some notable exceptions to this rule, the largest of which is the Nvidia driver. The Nvidia driver is instead loaded as a separate kernel module, which allows Nvidia to keep its source code hidden, but also allows the driver to be updated separately from the kernel. So, EAC could surely use this approach as well, right?</p>
<p>The separate kernel module approach comes with some gotchas. Firstly, the kernel is licensed under GPLv2 and many of the parts in the kernel require the calling code to also be GPLv2 due to the "viral" quality of GPL. This means that, legally speaking, if Epic were to turn EAC into a kernel module and started poking around the kernel APIs, they'd have to open source EAC or they'd be in a legal grey area. The first approach is obviously not possible due to their business model and the second is at least not a great look.</p>
<p>Another problem with separate kernel modules is that the Linux kernel only guarantees a stable user-facing interface. This means that almost anything is allowed to change inside the kernel as long as user-level programs continue functioning. This is also the reason why sometimes the Nvidia driver stops working when you upgrade from one kernel to the next without installing an up-to-date Nvidia driver as well. So, when Sweeney is complaining about the multitude of kernel configurations, he's not wrong. EAC would need to maintain a compatibility shim similar to that of the Nvidia driver, which ensures that the EAC kernel module functions with each kernel version out there. Every time the kernel updates, an EAC engineer would need to go over the changes and update the compatibility shim every time there's a breaking change while still maintaining the compatibility with older kernel versions.</p>
<p>Theoretically you could overcome this problem somewhat by only targeting the Steam Deck and its SteamOS. This would give you a single kernel version to target, although Epic would need to negotiate with Valve in order to ensure their driver is somehow shipped with SteamOS.</p>
<p>But the problems don't end there. Since Linux is a fully open platform, there is technically nothing that would prevent a determined cheater from cracking open the Linux source code and making some tactical changes to how the kernel behaves, building the kernel and then making the EAC kernel module blind. On Windows the EAC developers can assume that the black box that is the NT kernel is at least somewhat difficult to modify by users. This means that in kernel-space they can assume some level of security through obscurity. On Linux this assumption does not hold. The only way for Epic to overcome that problem would be to negotiate with Valve to lock down the Steam Deck, which Valve has already decided not to do.</p>
<p>So, from EAC's point of view the Linux platform can never be quite fully trusted, which is entirely fair, because from the user's point of view EAC can never be quite fully trusted.</p>
<p>But surely Epic could still somehow bring Fortnite to the Steam Deck, right? Surely they could ship a version of Fortnite without the kernel-level component, right?</p>
<p>That they could, which brings us to the points about market share and the viability of cheating. Sweeney argues that the Linux market is too small, which initially sounds a bit odd because he then goes on to worry about the large numbers of cheaters. The kicker is here that the small Linux market doesn't necessarily guarantee a low number of cheaters. If it turns out that certain cheats are possible via a Linux version of Fortnite, this will attract some cheaters to use the platform in order to bypass EAC. It won't be all of the cheaters, many casual cheaters would likely not bother to learn Linux in order to cheat in a video game, but there is no doubt a group of cheaters that would take the opportunity. So, Fortnite would see some increase in cheating, but without good data it is hard to determine how big that effect would be. However, considering the popularity and free-to-play nature of Fortnite, it could very well be that it would be an attractive enough target for cheaters to attack even if there is a slightly higher initial investment. Cheat makers on the other hand would probably eventually find ways to package their offerings in an accessible enough format, like boot-to-cheat USBs or pre-configured VM images.</p>
<p>Some solutions to this problem have been proposed. For example, they could silo Steam Deck/Linux users in such a way that they will never come into contact with the rest of the playerbase. This would contain cheating, but it's also a hard-handed measure that would likely be unpopular. It would also require some amount of work to accomplish and I think it's fair for Epic to discount options that would cause extra work on them.</p>
<p>So, what's the solution to the problem? Here's the thing: I don't think there is one. My personal opinion is that client-side anti-cheat is fundamentally limited and taking it into the kernel is a bandaid that comes with excessive cost and is simply incompatible with the Linux platform. So, as long as Epic insists on maintaining its current anti-cheat approach with Fortnite, I just don't think there's going to be Fortnite on Linux.</p>
<p>And that doesn't mean Tim Sweeney is wrong or lying about the difficulties of adapting that approach to Linux. It just means that a new or different approach is needed in the future.</p>

      <title>Valheim developers have another fireside chat filled with teasers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for even more content to come to Valheim? Well, there's still a bit of a wait and the developers teased biome updates previously but there's more to see - and hear.</p>
<p>In a fresh fireside chat, with a much upgraded seating area that's no longer just a fire in a forest, three members of Iron Gate had a talk about the game now it's one year on from the Early Access release. The fun thing is that this is clearly an unreleased build, as there's multiple sneaky new things surrounding them. Their official Twitter account even <a href="https://twitter.com/Valheimgame/status/1491411898335899648" target="_blank">teased</a> "How many sneak peeks can you spot?".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="15tM0hbyCs4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0cf66620dbdef64b003ce357f4c2c5f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/15tM0hbyCs4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At first glance it looks like they're adding in a new rug, a new set of armour, those chairs look different too…there's probably a good number of things to spot if you're a regular player and you have a keen eye. Do let us know in the comments if you spot anything interesting!</p>
<p>I really like how they talk about the game though, how they continue to be adamant that they don't want to pad the game out with useless things, it's all about having purpose.</p>

<p><strong>About the game:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world ended on the day the bombs fell. Since then, it’s always been like this: disease, hunger, death. The ruling Aristocrats — a faceless oligarchy that controls all resources — have unchallenged authority. There’s never enough food, water, or vaccine to go around. The rich receive regular doses of vaccinations in exchange for their unconditional government support. The poor live in fear, superstition, and squalor until they die.</p>
<p>Amy Wellard, a young woman reluctantly working for the government to qualify for the vaccine lottery, believes there’s a cure — and she’s going to find it. Even if it costs her her life.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 30 is out with big OneXPlayer improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimeraOS continues to provide a full-screen console-like Linux experience for those that want it, and ChimeraOS 30 is now live with some great upgrades.</p>
<p>First, the usual upgrades to the major parts like Linux Kernel 5.16.5, Mesa drivers 21.3.5, NVIDIA drivers 510.47.03 and upgrades to their own special compositor and Chimera software. Plus, a bump for RetroArch to version 1.10.0. The bigger changes come for those who have a OneXPlayer handheld device as it should work vastly better with ChimeraOS now thanks to controller detection fixes, screen orientation fixes, a fix for custom resolution support and a default resolution set properly to 1280x800. So out of the box, OneXPlayer devices should work nicely.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11405681391644411582gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11405681391644411582gol1.jpg"/></a>It boots directly to Steam Big Picture.</em></p>
<p>Once Valve actually replaces the Big Picture UI with the Deck UI, it will be fun to see ChimeraOS evolve with it. I've said it before and it remains true: no doubt there will be plenty of things ChimeraOS continues to do that Valve won't be able to do officially (or won't want to do) with SteamOS. Just like you have Proton GE that does things the official Proton doesn't / can't.</p>

      <title>WRAEK think they can change PC gaming with the Tactonic Pro</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The WRAEK Tactonic Pro is currently doing rounds because the team believe they can change gaming, by giving you an ultra-sensitive palm rest that you use in-game for movements. Is it time for a revolution on PC inputs?</p>
<p>With the basic idea being that you rest your palm on their special pad, which will detect your wiggling movements and convert it into actual movements in-game. They say it acts like a thumbstick, and it can "detect as little as 10g of force" with "isometric force technology found in joysticks of combat fighter jets but in a miniaturized version". Designed to sit underneath a tenkeyless keyboard, it's also magnetic to stick to the casing if your keyboard has a metal build.</p>
<p>Have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lb4ILxALqUQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba09cdfb88a41b873fd954d00777b3ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lb4ILxALqUQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To go along with it, they're also doing their own WRAEK Tactonic Keyboard which is a fully customisable, tenkeyless mechanical keyboard. What's really great to see though, is how Linux has clearly been making more waves - enough for this hardware vendor to target it too. They said their software is fully compatible with Linux!</p>

      <title>SimAirport getting some great upgrades ready for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little building and management on the go? SimAirport from LVGameDev LLC sounds like it might be a good choice, with the developer highlighting upcoming changes and improvements for the Steam Deck and it will help all platforms.</p>
<p>You probably don't need a big explanation to begin with on this one, the name SimAirport speaks for itself really. You construct and manage an Airport from a single plane to a massive international terminal filled to the brim with passengers, staff and it's your job to keep everything flying smoothly.</p>
<p>It already has a native Linux port, and so it should work quite well on the Deck. However, the developer has announced some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/598330/view/3118182224262686059" target="_blank">changes coming</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our initial testing on Steam Deck did reveal several issues and some quirks - from screen resolution to controller bindings &amp; even some audio issues. Several UIs required a bit of reworking while others may just need a small nudge in the right direction. For example, the top UI generally fits, unless the fuel HUD is enabled; to solve this the entire top UI now is able to move to the left and "attach" to the Menu button. This is a general change so you'll benefit even if you're not using the Steam Deck but happen to be playing on a smaller resolution desktop monitor or on a laptop!<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we're currently working on making sure the Steam Deck controls can be fully utilized in the most optimal way possible. For this we're reworking a good chunk of our input-handling code which will result in a good default experience on the Steam Deck, and it will also enable the use of controllers on other platforms, too! :)<br/>
<br/>
On the whole, we're thrilled to say that SimAirport runs well on the Steam Deck after some tweaks it's fully playable -- including all Workshop content &amp; mods being available on the platform!</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Royal Court DLC and a big free update are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The absolutely magnificent strategy game that is Crusader Kings III has today grown much bigger, with the Crusader Kings III: Royal Court DLC out now plus a big free update.</p>
<p>Bringing even more role-playing possibilities, Royal Court brings on the virtual fun of hearing pleas from subjects, and dealing with all the political fun that comes with having a court full of people who need to be kept happy. You need to climb the ladder a bit though to really show off, as the Throne Room is of course only available for those at the top, so time to get back-stabbing or marrying someone nice perhaps?</p>

<p>It wouldn't be a Paradox game without a massive free content update too, and they've also delivered that with version 1.5.0 "Fleur-de-Lis".</p>
<p>Here's the highlights of the free upgrade new content:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Court Positions: Hire on characters to serve in various roles in your court, giving them a salary in exchange for an effect. There are plenty of roles; from Seneschals to High Almoners, Bodyguards to Antiquarians. Look for skilled characters, as their Aptitude will determine how good they are at their job!</li>
<li>Cultural Overhaul: The culture system has been completely reworked, cultures are now made up of several different components, making each and every one unique.
	<ul>
<li>Acceptance: Cultures now have acceptance scores with all other cultures, determining how well they get along. The higher the acceptance, the lower the penalties, until they’re completely gone at 100% acceptance.</li>
<li>Ethos: The spirit of each culture lies in the ethos, which determines baseline cultural acceptance, and which Traditions are easier or harder to adopt.</li>
<li>Pillars: Heritage, Language, Aesthetics, Martial Tradition, and more. Pillars make up the foundation of a culture, and have a vast impact on its Acceptance towards other cultures.</li>
<li>Traditions: Traditions give each culture a unique flair, carrying modifiers, changes to rules, interactions, and much more. For each era a culture progresses through, more Traditions can be added.</li>
<li>As the Culture Head, add traditions to your culture over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal Languages: Characters can now learn languages. Knowing a language cuts opinion penalties in half towards characters and counties speaking that language. A character can know a limited amount of languages.
	<ul>
<li>Learn Language Scheme: A new scheme allows you to learn the language of another character. This scheme is improved through several Lifestyle perks and Dynasty Legacies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Steward Council Task, Promote Cultural Acceptance: Increase the acceptance of a culture in your realm towards your own culture. This job is significantly more effective for Independent rulers.</li>
<li>Artifacts/Inventory System: Characters can now carry Artifacts on their person. Equip a weapon, armor, regalia, headgear, and up to four trinkets.
	<ul>
<li>Durability: Artifacts have durability, which decreases over time or when sieges/raids damage them. Pay gold to repair them, or reforge them into Court Artifacts if you own the Royal Court expansion.</li>
<li>Artifact Claims: Gain claims on artifacts carried by your predecessors, and go to war to reclaim lost heirlooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steal Artifact Scheme: A new scheme that allows you to retake lost artifacts, as long as you have a Claim on them.</li>
<li>Challenge for Artifact Duel: Challenge those that hold artifacts that you claim, the winner takes it, the loser forfeits their claim.</li>
<li>Commission Artifact: Pay gold to summon smiths and craftsmen to forge basic artifacts for your inventory.</li>
<li>Coat of Arms Designer: Design your very own Coat of Arms and apply it to your House, Dynasty, or Title/s. Adjust existing designs, or create a CoA entirely from scratch. As with the Ruler Designer, CoA designs can also be copied to the clipboard and shared with others. You can also save the current CoA to disk as an image file, to show off to your friends.</li>
<li>Added a new look for the Duel event window, where weapons will brandish their weapons against each other. If a character has an artifact, the look of their weapons will reflect that.</li>
<li>Added a lot of new character animations</li>
<li>You can now change the map color of titles you're allowed to rename</li>
<li>You can now pick the map color of your new faith when you create a faith</li>
<li>Added the Gardener Trait</li>
<li>Added new Men at Arms - Monaspa, unlocked by the Caucasian wolves tradition (requires to be or descend from Georgian culture)</li>
<li>Added new Men at Arms - Mulaththamun, unlocked by the tradition Desert Ribats for Berber heritage cultures</li>
<li>Added new Men at Arms - Nile Archers, unlocked by the tradition Land of the bow, for East African heritage</li>
<li>Added new Men at Arms - Garuda Warriors, unlocked by the Garuda Warriors tradition (Dravidian heritage)</li>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.24 is out now and what a beauty it is</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE has today released the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.24 desktop</a>, filled with goodies across the whole thing and this is an LTS release (long-term support) that will continue seeing updates until a final Plasma 5 release after which Plasma 6 succeeds it. The environment that will be powering the desktop mode on the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, it's a very exciting time to be a KDE user and no doubt the developers are excited too.</p>
<p>The team said that this release "focuses on smoothing out wrinkles, evolving the design, and improving the overall feel and usability of the environment".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13118551561644324060gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13118551561644324060gol1.png"/></a>Plasma 5.24 - credit: KDE</em></p>
<p>It's quite an important release actually, especially with all the upgrades to Discover (the software installer / updater). Discover is smarter and clearer about error messages, smarter about not letting you break your system by removing essential packages (or Discover managing to remove itself). Lots to be happy about there for users of all skill levels.</p>
<p>On top of that Discover also gives you an option to reboot once updates are done, there's a few UI adjustments to the Update Page to make it less overwhelming and you can now also open and install locally downloaded Flatpak packages too.</p>
<p>A huge addition is the newer Overview mode, which is much similar to how GNOME Overview works. This allows you to get a view of different workspaces, interact with all the various windows and applications you have open in the background and the ability to search your system too. See the short video demo KDE put out:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9887213191644324519gol1.webm"> </video>
</div>
<p>This Overview isn't quite finished, they say it's technically a Beta right now.</p>
<p>Absolutely loads more new, especially when it comes to Wayland that will eventually replace the ancient X11 system. Wayland + Plasma now supports colours greater than 8bits, better support for VR headsets and drawing tablets, the Spectacle screenshot tool can now access the <em>Active Window</em> mode and there's more keyboard shortcuts across the desktop that now work with Wayland too.</p>
<p>Other random improvements include a faster shut down, a new wallpaper, important notifications now get an orange strip to bring more attention to them and the list of tweaks goes on.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II recreation fheroes2 adds more content support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>fheroes2 is a constantly improving game engine reimplementation of Heroes of Might and Magic II. A new version was just released recently and it's become the absolute best way to play this classic.</p>
<p>A multi-platform project, one that was written from scratch so there's never any worry about a rights holder appearing to take it down. It's very much like OpenMW for Morrowind and OpenXcom for the original X-Com. It's not a basic remake though, as the developers are also trying to improve old issues in the original.</p>

<p>Changes highlight for version 0.9.12:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make AI heroes to create complex paths over water and land and even through whirlpools</li>
<li>Fix remaining issues with object passabilities on a map</li>

      <title>Future sci-fi indie RPG Beyond Mankind: The Awakening now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to go back to Earth and retake it. Beyond Mankind: The Awakening from developer Brytenwalda recently released a native Linux version, built with the Unity game engine. <em>The developer previously worked on the Viking Conquest DLC for Mount &amp; Blade.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Mankind: The Awakening takes place in a future destroyed by some sort of genetic mutation. This caused certain types of people to go a bit wild, and eventually it led to war and almost a total annihilation of planet Earth. Mankind survived in space - and now you're part of the rag-tag group trying to bring it all back to life.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intriguing and dark narrative</strong> - <em>Beyond Mankind</em> provides a unique experience in which you will discover a post-apocalyptic world through the main story and secondary quests shaped by your decisions.</li>
<li><strong>A rich and dynamic world</strong> - Help human civilization, exiled in space, avoid extinction while exploring an Earth devastated by nuclear war.</li>
<li><strong>Unique character generation</strong> - Create a character based on DNA and culture selection, then accumulate experience to improve your abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Complex social interactions</strong> - Experience personality-based kinship, loyalty, and romance with other characters.</li>
<li><strong>Real dilemmas</strong> - Face problems that may not always have a completely positive solution, let alone an obvious one.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging survival mechanics</strong> - Explore, collect or hunt for food, craft tools, light fires for cooking and warmth, and construct a shelter. Above all, monitor your psychological state.</li>
<li><strong>3D inventory management</strong> - Pick your resources at your camp. Storage space is limited, so choosing well can make the difference between life and death.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The story seemed interesting enough but there's currently a bug I encountered which prevented my play-through, which I've reported so hopefully I can pick it up again in future.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1301590/Beyond_Mankind_The_Awakening/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Games CEO says a clear No to Fortnite on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Were you hoping to easily play Fortnite on the upcoming Steam Deck? Well, Tim Sweeney the Epic Games CEO has made it clear that it's not going to happen officially. The thing to remember right now is that both <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/easy-anti-cheat-gets-much-simpler-for-proton-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> do support Linux. Both for native Linux builds and for Windows games run through Steam Play Proton. However, it's all user-space with no Kernel modules.</p>
<p>On Twitter, user Stormy178 asked if there were plans to make Fortnite compatible with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> to which Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490519194915459072" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortnite no, but there's a big effort underway to maximize Easy Anti Cheat compatibility with Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The questioning continued and when asked why, Sweeney followed up <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490565925648715781" target="_blank">with</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t have confidence that we’d be able to combat cheating at scale under a wide array of kernel configurations including custom ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another user mentioned it seemed that Epic's CEO didn't trust their own product, Sweeney obviously couldn't let that remain unanswered <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490759707841159174" target="_blank">with</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With regard to anti-cheat on the Linux platform supporting custom kernels and the threat model to a game of Fortnite's size, YES THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a number of ways, he's actually right. Windows is closed source, so is the NT Kernel and usually 99% of drivers for it are too. Client-side anti-cheat obviously relies a lot on security by obscurity, so people can't see everything it's doing. This is part of the problem on Linux, where the Kernel and practically all development on it is done right out in the open and it changes rapidly. Developing anti-cheat against such an open Kernel probably isn't going to be even remotely easy. There will be ways though, especially if something like the Steam Deck had a fully signed Kernel and some sort of guarantee it's being used - probably numerous ways smarter people know of.</p>
<p>Really though, overall it doesn't give a lot of confidence for developers who might be looking to hook up their anti-cheat ready for their games to work on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The big difference it seems, is the size of the playerbase and how much of a target each game is. Sweeney is not saying it's not suitable as a whole, just that Fortnite is a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490758632836894724" target="_blank">massive</a> target for cheaters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The threat model for anti-cheat varies per game based on the number of active players and ability to gain profit by selling cheats or gain prominence by cheating. Hence anti-cheat which suffices for one game may not for another game with 10, 100, or 1000 times more players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One user followed up by suggesting it was just a case of Sweeney not wanting Fortnite on a "rival's platform", to which Sweeney gave <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1490841213347540993" target="_blank">this answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epic would be happy to put Fortnite on Steam. We wouldn't be happy to give Steam 20-30% of its revenue for the privilege. Supporting Steam Deck hardware is a separate issue, but the market for non-Steam-hosted games on limited availability Steam Deck hardware is how big exactly?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, you're going to need Windows or to stream it via GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck. At least for games without such anti-cheat, you should be able to use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/heroic-games-launcher-for-epic-games-on-linux-gets-some-more-fixes/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>It does mean there's space open for another game to take its place on the Steam Deck officially.</em></p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 11: Forgotten Heresies</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-10-for-i-have-sinned/" target="_blank">Part 10: For I Have Sinned</a></strong></p>
<p>Almost from the very start Raven Software and id Software had a symbiotic relationship. Raven would use id tech to power their games for years, but one of their deepest collaborations was on <em>Heretic</em>, with then id Software designer John Romero even acting as producer. Given the Linux friendly atmosphere at id, it is no surprise that some of that would start to rub off on Raven, culminating in Loki Software negotiating to make a port of <em>Heretic II</em>.</p>
<p>Rights conflicts between id Software and publisher Activision keep <em>Heretic II</em> from being sold digitally, although Microsoft's recent acquisitions mean they will soon own them both. Regardless, I was quite pleased when I found a raggity Windows jewel case of the game selling for $5 CAD at a local second hand store. Not long after a lot of four Loki Software games was put up for sale on eBay, including the Linux release. Suddenly I had both versions of this rare game to play.</p>
<p>Unlike with the other titles I have covered this would be my first time with <em>Heretic II</em>, my past exposure limited to just tooling around the shareware levels of the previous <em>Heretic</em> and <em>HeXen</em> games. Despite picking up the story of Corvus from where it left off at the end of <em>Heretic</em>, the game stands alone outside of passing references and a few returning mechanics, more of a spin off from the Serpent Riders Trilogy than a continuation. </p>
<p>The greatest departure is the adoption of a third-person perspective, playing more like the later Loki Software game port <em>Rune</em> than prior entries in the series in terms of controls. <em>Heretic II</em> is also a lot more plot driven, and while it does feature hubs like <em>HeXen</em> and <em>HeXen II</em> did, they are a lot less complicated and require minimal backtracking. The result is a much more straightforward and accessible action romp less concerned with puzzle solving.</p>
<p>I have to be honest though, Loki botched this one. The installer on the disc is broken, meaning you need to download the heretic2-install-x86.run setup script instead. This is not a huge ordeal, assuming you are aware of the issue, but things went further downhill when I used the Loki Update tool to patch the game from 1.06b to the final 1.06c release. This introduced a number of sporadic but persistent segmentation faults throughout the game. Reverting solved the issue.</p>

<p>The performance was also uneven. Turning off dynamic lighting using the "gl_dynamic" and "cl_lights" console variables did much to help keep the frame rate consistent, but at the cost of making it harder to navigate the darker levels, as Light of the Seraph Shrines no longer glowed. Without this change I found myself avoiding weapons such as the Hellstaff due to the accompanying slow down, so the game was still more playable, even at the expense of navigation.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Cloud Living Quarters close to the end I also hit a curious bug where any savegame I made would be corrupted. Thankfully the autosaves between levels were immune and I could still quicksave, allowing me to confront the final boss and complete the game, which did not seem a given at times. Menus and the opening and closing cinematics were also sluggish with OpenGL enabled, and would even draw on top of the loading screen on occasion.</p>
<p>I decided I would try playing <em>Heretic II</em> at Armageddon difficulty from Windows 98 to compare, and from there I could run the game at the same resolution with all the graphics options maxed without a hitch. For those curious, I did manage to reach Silverspring Palace, but was running out of ammunition. I used an elevator to cheese most of the enemies, often gibbing them in the door, but still lacked the resources needed to defeat the Celestial Watcher.</p>
<p>The Linux version does hold one advantage by offering the <em>Enhancement Pack</em> out of the box, a glorified patch which was released as a free update to Windows users around the same time as the Linux port, featuring a number of game tweaks and multiplayer enrichments. <em>Heretic II</em> may start off slow, showcasing unimaginative warehouses early on as well as an obnoxious swamp, but overall it is a fun ride that is well worth revisiting if you can find a copy.</p>
<p>The business relationship formed between Loki and Raven would result in one more Linux release before the final closure of the porting house, a title which was under development in parallel with <em>Heretic II</em> with a prestigious licence but would not be released for another year and a half. This game would later prove so controversial that it was effectively banned in the next province over from where I live. Not that it stopped anyone from playing it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Previews are up, plus dbrand announce Project Killswitch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The flood gates are beginning to open around the Steam Deck with a few big YouTube channels doing a hands-on preview now live. Plus, dbrand poke fun at Nintendo with their upcoming Steam Deck accessory kit.</p>
<p>Starting briefly with dbrand. They're calling it <a href="https://dbrand.com/killswitch" target="_blank">Project Killswitch</a>, and I think we all know what the joke is there. They're not saying exactly what it is yet, other than it having a "Impact Resistant Grip Case" and a "Built-in ?????????" and then a few more bullet points that are just question marks:</p>

      <title>Yacht Club Games&#39; newest title is the upcoming Mina the Hollower</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yacht Club Games, know for the popular Shovel Knight series has a new game in development called Mina the Hollower, and it's currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter with it being a clear early success.</p>
<p>"Descend into a frightful world of action-adventure in Mina the Hollower. Take control of Mina, a renowned Hollower hurtled into a desperate mission to rescue a cursed island. Burrow beneath hazards and monsters, whip foes into oblivion, and gear up with an arsenal of sidearms and trinkets. Explore a vast world filled with pixel-perfect graphics, masterful gameplay, beastly bosses, and infectious music. Encounter a cast of bizarre characters, search out secrets in an array of exotic locales, and illuminate the omnipresent darkness in Mina the Hollower, a brand new game from the developers who brought you Shovel Knight!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Fx0aJCRRpE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a668af00cc260eba50275a820973117c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Fx0aJCRRpE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At time of writing it's at around $710,000. The developer has now confirmed they plan a Linux and macOS port, if the Kickstarter manages to hit at least $800,000 in funding through the stretch-goals (of which it's already hit many). How quickly it managed to pull in multiple hundreds of thousands just goes to show how popular retro-styled games are, and there's plenty with faith in Yacht Club Games as a developer. There's another 24 days to go so the Linux goal will likely be hit quite easily.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hauntingly authentic 8-bit visuals in the style of Game Boy Color, refined for the modern era.</li>
<li>Modern touches abound: detailed animation, widescreen visuals, and rock-solid controls!</li>
<li>Leap, dodge, and burrow through the ground to battle monsters or navigate the world.</li>
<li>Lash at foes with your trusty whip, Nightstar- or choose from an arsenal of weapons, each with a totally different move set.</li>
<li>Discover and utilize a reliquary's worth of unusual Sidearms to gain the advantage in combat.</li>
<li>Collect and equip Trinkets to acquire a variety of exotic effects. Level Mina up to suit your unique playstyle.</li>
<li>Electrifying MSX-style soundtrack by chiptune virtuoso, Jake Kaufman.</li>
<li>Descend into the depths of madness with a bone-chilling, yet heartwarming tale inspired by Victorian Gothic horror.</li>
<li>Explore a huge, dark world brimming with secrets, challenging battles, and interconnected level design.</li>

      <title>Indie store itch.io comes out swinging against NFTs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/valve-banning-games-that-allow-exchanging-cryptocurrencies-or-nfts/" target="_blank">Valve banned NFT</a> games from Steam but another store has come out clearly against them, with the official <a href="http://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> Twitter account releasing a very clear statement.</p>
<p>In their short thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1490141815294414856" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the itch team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few have asked about our stance on NFTs: NFTs are a scam. If you think they are legitimately useful for anything other than the exploitation of creators, financial scams, and the destruction of the planet the we ask that please reevaluate your life choices. Peace</p>
<p>Also f̸̗̎ú̴̩c̷̖͌ḳ̵̀ any company that says they support creators and also endorses NFTs in any way. They only care about their own profit and the opportunity for wealth above anyone else. Especially given the now easily available discourse concerning the problems of NFTs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, the itch store does have a bunch of "games" <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-nft" target="_blank">tagged</a> with NFT, although they largely seem to be jokes and parodies. The store isn't exactly known for its quality control, so hopefully they're keeping a closer eye on this given their clear stance against the tech.</p>
<p>What are NFTs? Short for "non-fungible token", they can be pretty much anything digital - supposedly as a form of ownership but you don't really end up actually owning anything. It's pretty ridiculous when you look into it more. Unfortunately, they've been used in a lot of scams, with original artists being ripped off constantly and there's a huge amount of evidence everywhere on how problematic NFTs have become. Want to know more? Here's a good video on it:</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds a new cell to grow with</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in Early Access, Thrive is an impressive scientific evolution sim developed in Godot Engine that continues to mature with a new version up.</p>
<p>Sounds like a pretty fun release too, adding in a "chemoreceptor organelle" cell you can evolve your creature with. This will allow you to sniff-out needed resources from quite a distance so you won't get as lost once you manage to acquire it through a little basic exploration and growth. There's also now a timeline tab in the reports screen, which allows you to view the current history of the microscopic world you've been exploring and surviving in. Plus, lots of bug fixes and optimizations and a Godot Engine upgrade too.</p>
<p>New release video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ptCT-o11tpg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c1f40221744adbef65abde821bf613e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ptCT-o11tpg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available on <a href="https://revolutionarygames.itch.io/thrive" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and direct from the developer. While it's a paid game on both stores, it is also entirely free and open source elsewhere on <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games" target="_blank">GitHub</a> plus you can support them on their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thrivegame" target="_blank">Patreon</a> too.</p>

      <title>Online multiplayer for OpenMW (Morrowind) TES3MP is alive again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenMW is a fantastic open source game engine reimplementation for Morrowind, plus there's the online fork of TES3MP which has sprung back to life with a new release. A project that should eventually merge with OpenMW officially, for now it's a separate fork until OpenMW hits the big 1.0.</p>
<p>TES3MP 0.8.0 is now out and based on the latest OpenMW 0.47.0 release, and the developer said it "fixes a large part of the remaining gameplay problems and also adds some major features". It took a little while, as the developer explained how they "lost my motivation for TES3MP during the pandemic, but I've been regaining it recently because I want to look back on this project as one that I ended up finishing instead of one that I just got very far on".</p>
<p>Just some of the new additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Synchronization of custom records for interior cells, allowing for on-the-fly creation of entirely new interiors or ones based on existing interiors</li>
<li>Synchronization of custom records for clientside scripts, allowing for on-the-fly creation or overriding of MWScripts</li>
<li>Synchronization of custom records for containers, doors, activators, statics, ingredients, apparatuses, lockpicks, probes, repair tools, lights, body parts, sounds and record-based game settings</li>
<li>Synchronization of clientside local variables based on which clientside scripts are set to be synchronized by the server</li>
<li>Synchronization of clientside global variables based on rules defined for each one in the server scripts, with the possibility of also creating new clientside globals on-the-fly</li>
<li>Synchronization of active spell effects for players and actors that no longer relies on players witnessing the spellcasting associated with the effects</li>
<li>Synchronization of death animations for players and actors</li>
<li>Synchronization of merchant inventories and gold pools</li>
<li>Synchronization of environmental sounds made by players, e.g. when picking up or dropping items, when opening or closing chests and doors</li>
<li>Synchronization of plant harvesting from herbalism mods</li>
<li>Reworked attack synchronization with more precision, fixing skipped attacks for creatures with fast attack animations and making melee attack animations not depend on the direction a player or actor is moving in on the current client</li>
<li>Reworked spellcasting synchronization, fixing improper failed spellcasting for actors with fast casting animations and reducing desyncs by not tying spellcasting for non-local actors and players to their animations on the current client</li>
<li>Reworked equipment synchronization for players with less spammy packets</li>
<li>Packet for resetting interior and exterior cells on-the-fly</li>
<li>Packet for setting players as allies so they don't break each other's stealth and so their companions don't fight back when attacked by mistake</li>
<li>Packet for overriding cell destinations, useful for moving players to instances of interiors instead of regular interiors</li>
<li>Packet for tracking hits received by objects</li>
<li>Packet for tracking dialogue choices selected by players</li>
<li>Packet for tracking the cooldowns of powers used by players</li>
<li>Allow GameSettings packet to override clientside game settings</li>
<li>Allow custom records to override AI services for NPCs, alarm and flee values for NPCs and creatures, as well as scales, blood types, soul values and attack damage for creatures</li>
</ul>

<p>As you do need the Morrowind data files to play it, you do need to own a copy.

      <title>FEX-Emu is a promising project for gaming on 64bit Arm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play more games on Arm devices? Projects like Box86 and Box64 do already exist but is there a better option? <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" target="_blank">FEX-Emu</a> sounds like it's going to be another great open source way to do what you want.</p>
<p>The problem is that most games and software aren't really built for Arm, games especially of course since we're not exactly swimming in powerful Arm hardware market for gaming on Linux (or Windows). Emulation and translation layers once again to the rescue then. FEX-Emu is getting quite advanced now, and it's even able to run Wine / Proton too.</p>
<p>FEX-2202 just recently has a new release and the developer did a talk at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/fex/" target="_blank">FOSDEM 2022</a>, giving a rather nice introduction and overview of what it is and how it works that you can watch below and it's pretty fascinating:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7LRmpx3Rebs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d3758f5357178e1ecd3472bf5c8c64a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7LRmpx3Rebs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's actually quite amazing how far gaming can be pushed now on Arm devices, especially when run through systems like this! Want to see more? The developer also put up a "Sizzle reel" demonstrating some games that will already run on FEX-Emu:</p>

      <title>RPG game engine Flare gets improved gamepad support, fonts and more in v1.13</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Flare is a free and open source game engine for creating RPGs, plus it also has its own Empyrean Campaign to play through and it continued to get enhanced to be a bit more modern. Version 1.13 was just recently release, bringing with it some pretty major enhancements.</p>
<p>A big one is improved gamepad support that was overhauled. They've moved from using the SDL_Joystick API to using the SDL_GameController API, along with improved gamepad mapping and fixes to some deadzone issues. Navigating the UI is also quite a bit easier now too, as various actions give you a pop-up now to easily pick what to do.</p>
<p>Something more gameplay related is the addition of a fog-of-war. This is supported on both the game world, as well as the minimap. Font rendering also saw a huge improvement! Previously slightly difficult to read text is now dramatically clearer on the UI especially. Multiple equipment loadouts is now a thing too, so you can quickly swap between your favourite sets.</p>

<p>Nice to see this open source project pull in some pretty big advancements, hope to see it continue!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://flarerpg.org/2022/01/31/flare-1-13/" target="_blank">release notes</a> for more. They've now added an AppImage to download and run easily or Linux, or there's the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.flarerpg.Flare" target="_blank">Flathub page</a> too.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for Epic Games on Linux gets some more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Readying up for the onslaught of users on the Steam Deck who will probably want to play some of their Epic Store loot, the free and open source Heroic Games Launcher has a new bug fix release up.</p>
<p>An application that has only become more important with the Steam Deck, since it ships with Linux and Epic Games don't support Linux with their store. This at least gives Linux desktop gamers and Steam Deck users a really easy way to get all their games in one place.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13008611481644224886gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13008611481644224886gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new and improved in Heroic 2.1.1 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated general settings page</li>
<li>An easy way to view a full log file for each game</li>
<li>Epic Services online status check is fixed up</li>
<li>The Wine manager got updated with a progress bar and it can be aborted</li>
<li>DXVK/VKD3D installation was fixed</li>
<li>+ Other bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a small release, as a much bigger and more exciting feature-release is coming up with Heroic 2.2 with GOG store integration. They're also working on Flatpak support too! In the last major update, Heroic <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/heroic-games-launcher-for-epic-games-on-linux-adds-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">added gamepad support</a> to the UI including an on-screen keyboard so it's looking great.</p>

      <title>Linux Kernel getting prepped for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's already known that the Steam Deck will ship with Valve's own SteamOS 3 based on Arch Linux, what about running more standard Linux distributions? It will get easier in a future version of the Linux Kernel.</p>
<p>Since it's open source, Linux gives Valve a lot of true control on what they can do and tweak for the Steam Deck and that's a big part of the reason they went with Linux instead of Windows. At release it will likely be using a good number of Valve special patches, many of which will be upstreamed to various projects and we're starting to see part of that now.</p>
<p>Sent into the Kernel mailing list <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/2/5/391" target="_blank">was this patch</a> across the weekend that adds in a driver to expose various low-level features of the Steam Deck including (but not limited to): the CPU fan control, Read-only access to DDIC registers, Battery temperature measurements, Various display related control knobs and a USB Type-C connector event notification.</p>
<p>Having it upstreamed isn't just good for other distributions of Linux though, it's less hassle for Valve once it's all official as there's no messing around with patches.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will all be pulled in and ready for Linux Kernel 5.18, which would be due out quite a bit later this year.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma continues improving to stop you breaking things</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Nate Graham has highlighted <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/02/04/this-week-in-kde-discover-redesign-has-begun/" target="_blank">more recent work</a> for the KDE Plasma desktop environment (the one the Steam Deck will come with) and it's all sounding great.</p>
<p>Continuing their effort to prevent breakage, just like stopping the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/kde-discover-prevents-breaking-your-linux-system/" target="_blank">Discover software centre removing your desktop</a>, Discover now cannot uninstall itself. That's right, previously Discover was able to end up removing itself from your desktop! Now though, it won't as there's new checks in place.</p>
<p>Discover is also seeing something of a UI overhaul now too for application pages. So when you click on something in Discover you're interested in installing, you'll now get clearer information on each app like the size and version information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2621205751644071176gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2621205751644071176gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/711470891644071180gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/711470891644071180gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It's really nice to see so much effort being put into Discover, since that is the way users are supposed to find and install apps on Plasma. Even more fixes came in like it no longer crashing when you install or uninstall more than one Flatpak app at once, showing the correct size for "very very large" packages, a better screenshot pop-up for applications when you're viewing their page and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Wayland improvements continued apace too like Kate (the text editor) no longer flashes when you hit Ctrl+S to save your changes and dragging-and-dropping various things to XWayland apps no longer sometimes makes them stop accepting clicks until the system is restarted.</p>
<p>Dolphin (the file manager) improvements coming along too like it no longer crashing if you cancel an archiving job in the middle that was initiated from one of Dolphin’s context menu "Compress" items. The list goes on, as Graham mentions the blog posts only scratch the surface of the working going into KDE Plasma.</p>

      <title>Get some quality games and help charity in the F*CK CANCER Bundle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Get some top quality games, while also helping a charity doing good work in the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fck-cancer-bundle" target="_blank">Humble F*CK CANCER Bundle</a>.</p>
<p>The wording on the bundle is a <em>bit</em> rubbish, as it says you need to pay at least $10 for 100% to go to charity, but it doesn't actually let you pay any less - so it <strong>will</strong> all go to the selected charity. This bundle supports Cancerfonden, a Swedish charity with a main aim to raise and distribute money for cancer research.</p>
<p>Games included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead By Daylight (won't work due to anti-cheat)</li>
<li>PAYDAY 2</li>
<li>World War Z: Aftermatch</li>
<li>Magicka</li>
<li>Dungeon of the Endless</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wild</li>
<li>Homeworld Remastered Collection</li>
<li>Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak</li>
<li>Little Nightmares</li>
<li>Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons</li>
<li>Peppy's Adventure</li>
<li>Red Faction: Armageddon</li>
<li>Hamilton's Great Adventure</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, that's actually a really good bundle. Worth it alone just for the Homeworld games which work well with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Stadia continues the slow downward spiral</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-stadia-stream-plan-partnerships-peloton-bungie-gaming-service-2022-2?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> has highlighted some continuing changes for Google's cloud gaming service Stadia, and it doesn't exactly sound good - but it's also something that was mostly already announced. It's doing the rounds right now across various other outlets of course, as Stadia has never exactly been popular.</p>
<p><em>Back in November 2021, I wrote an article titled "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/two-years-on-stadia-seems-to-have-no-direction-left/" target="_blank">Two years on, Stadia seems to have no direction left</a>" and it doesn't sound like it's going to get any better.</em></p>
<p>We already knew that Google had shut down its internal game development studios for Stadia, with their focus to stick with third-party releases. That was seen as quite a <em>big</em> blow to Stadia when it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/google-shutting-their-internal-game-dev-studios-focusing-directly-on-stadia-tech/" target="_blank">announced in Early 2021</a>, and even then they said clearly the Stadia tech would continue on "for industry partners".</p>
<p>The article mentions "Google Stream" is now the new name for the Stadia tech Google provide to other companies, and the Stadia consumer platform (the store) has been "deprioritized within Google, insiders said, with a reduced interest in negotiating blockbuster third-party titles" so over time it's likely to see less titles release.</p>
<p>It's actually a <strong>huge</strong> shame, as the Stadia tech is actually <em>really</em> good and it is still by far the easiest and most fluid cloud gaming service I've ever personally used. I found Xbox Cloud to have poor quality overall and GeForce NOW was just a mess of launchers. Stadia sadly has been badly managed from the get-go, with expectations inside Google that were very clearly just <em>way</em> too high.</p>
<p>They also clearly got the revenue model completely wrong. I don't think it would have <em>entirely</em> saved it, but it would have easily been far more popular if they doubled-down on the subscription. Not everyone is Microsoft though and can afford to do something like Game Pass but this is Google - they absolutely could have. It was asking a lot to get people to buy full-price (sometimes more expensive too) digital games, that you only have for streaming and no local copy at all — with an optional subscription that took them <em>forever</em> to properly explain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Stadia community managers have jumped in to try and calm things down on <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia/status/1489758125192216579" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. In a thread they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you hear one thing, hear this: The Stadia team is working really hard on a great future for Stadia and cloud gaming.</p>
<p>We hope you agree, and we know the proof is in the playing.</p>
<p>We’re particularly proud to be offering 50 games to Pro members in February, with more than 100 titles to join Stadia in 2022 and plenty of Free Play Days for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>There’s also more feature goodness coming to Stadia too - stuff we can’t talk about just yet, but we promise to share when we can.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, Stadians.</p>

      <title>Dying Light 2 Stay Human is out and works well on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dying Light 2 will be easily one of the biggest releases this year and the good news is that it works on Linux without any messing around. <u>Note</u>: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Tested with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> (specifically Proton Experimental), so far the experience has been pretty good, although with a caveat that I've yet to try co-op. At least as far as single-player goes, it works really well. Interestingly for a lot of players on Windows, the game just crashed trying to start the game - no such problem here on Linux.</p>
<p>Showing the true power of Proton as a compatibility layer, having such a high-profile release working out of the box on day-1 is a really fantastic thing for Linux. The original Dying Light is also one of my favourite open-world Zombie-smashers, so it's quite exciting to get to run through Dying Light 2 right away like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D5rwi6cMvHc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8a93e4a99e80b15174d2a8455e5e87bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D5rwi6cMvHc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Both the DirectX 11 and 12 modes work, although switching from 11 (the default) to 12 did cause a hard lock-up requiring a reboot. After that though, loading back in and it continued working just fine. Performance between the two modes doesn't seem all that different either, at least on NVIDIA with the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.</p>
<p>Considering how Techland supported the first game for so long, I think we can expect good things for the future of Dying Light 2. Techland have already promised 5+ years of continued support with free DLCs, various in-game events, bigger paid story DLC, new enemies, new weapons and much more.</p>
<p>Something to note is that the game does include Denuvo Anti-tamper, which caused a bit of a ruckus since Techland did not even mention it until right before the launch. Thankfully Denuvo has worked on Linux with Proton for some time now and doesn't appear to cause any playability issues here, although be careful if you switch between Proton versions for testing on Dying Light 2 as it may trip it up.</p>
<p>Be sure to also add <code class="inline-code">-nologos</code> to your Steam launch options, otherwise you'll need to spam button-press to get through annoyingly long logo screens.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dying-light-2-stay-human?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/534380/Dying_Light_2_Stay_Human/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Free and open source space sim Pioneer gets a big UI upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pioneer started off life as a basic spiritual successor to Frontier: Elite II and nowadays it continues being upgraded, to give fans of classic 3D space exploration something fun. A new release went up on February 3 that has officially removed their old UI system, in favour of more modern interfaces using the very popular <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">Dear ImGui</a>.</p>
<p>You can see some of the new UI work in the below shots (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19551394571643984428gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19551394571643984428gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8416503051643984430gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8416503051643984430gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the major changes for this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New galaxy skybox, improved star brightness and density.</li>
<li>Redesign the BBS layout, show pertinent mission info.</li>
<li>New slot-based ship equipment display.</li>
<li>Completely new System Atlas mode for System Map.</li>
<li>Add System Overview Widget to System Map view.</li>
<li>Xylophis overhaul, new model.</li>
<li>Name generation expanded, and make first + last name match.</li>
<li>Rebalance goods restocking &amp; goods availability, allowing bulk trading.</li>
<li>Draw sector map labels with ImGui.</li>
<li>Rewrite internal renderer API, improve performance with many draw calls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rendering changes sound quite exciting. Not only should it perform better than ever but it has opened things up for future enhancements, like having more complicated (and modern) graphical effects. Sounds like 2022 could be a big year for the Pioneer space sim.</p>

<p>What we're seeing shape up here, is easily going to be the most incredible launch line-up of games for anything - ever. Place your bets, what do you think the total number of Deck Verified titles will be on February 25 when the Steam Deck hits the official launch?</p>
<p>This is only those titles fully Verified too as there's also now 111 titles that are marked as Playable like Factorio, RimWorld, The Witcher 3, Deep Rock Galactic, Valheim, Morrowind, Path of Exile and the list goes on. Some of the reasons being text too small, manual graphics settings adjustments needed, launchers, spotty gamepad support and so on. We expect many of the Playable titles to improve or even get Verified before the Steam Deck launches.</p>
<p>Have you decided on the first game you will be loading up yet?</p>

      <title>The Hand of Merlin RPG coming to Linux officially, sometime March onwards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of The Hand of Merlin, a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend meets with sci-fi horror, have confirmed their plans for the full release.</p>
<p>It's getting closer to the big 1.0 to leave Early Access and keeping up with their previous confirmation, they do plan to support Linux (and macOS) officially too. In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/600610/view/3091160626474086708" target="_blank">development post</a>, their team mentioned however their final release has been pushed back to sometime this "Spring" to not butt heads with some of the bigger games releasing, and to give them more time to polish the game.</p>
<p>For the Linux release they said this (emphasis ours):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After that, sometime during March, the plan is to release the editor, so anyone interested in modding the game would be able to start messing with it. <strong>We would also start officially supporting Linux</strong> and macOS. Keep in mind that just as with all other plans, stuff could happen that messes them up, and I’ll try to keep you informed if stuff goes horribly wrong or we’re forced to re-prioritize anything.</p>

      <title>Steam gets a few useful UI tweaks to show Cloud Sync status and Game Install Size</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the Steam Deck release, it seems the desktop client for Steam is getting a few handy UI changes too.</p>
<p>In one of the most recent upgrades to the opt-in Steam Client Beta, a small but very useful change came in to let you actually see the required space of a game on the Library page before downloading. It's such a small change, but a very welcome one for when you're quickly flicking through your thousands-strong library to pick something to install.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18891686091643892158gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18891686091643892158gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Not only that, another tweak was made to the Library UI to actually show the status of Steam Cloud sync now too. Showing if it's currently synced or if it's out of date, and clicking it will allow you to resync if there is an issue. So it will now look like the below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21063907531643892339gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21063907531643892339gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Even more improvements also came along for the ride, like making Offline mode better, as Valve said they have removed "most instances of long timeouts" when trying to launch a game. Oh, and something about properly tracking "file changes for games which use AutoCloud when playing offline". They're going to need to ensure offline mode is as pristine as possible for the Steam Deck, especially since it's a portable it would not be a great look if after downloading a game that it couldn't run right away if you're offline.</p>

<p>Do you have experience with the Unity game engine? Well, Daniel Mullins Games are hiring to continue future development of Inscryption and the job description looked pretty interesting.</p>
<p>What is Inscryption? It's described as "an inky black card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie.

With an Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam from over 50,000 players!</p>
<p>The actual job involves entirely taking over future development of the game! They want it to continue to receive upgrades and general maintenance "for months or years to come" and some of the duties of the job could include:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Adding features such as input remapping and Steam Workshop implementation.</li>
<li>Preparing OSX and Linux ports.</li>

      <title>Pop!_OS Linux gets better game performance and desktop responsiveness</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have done something very interesting with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> lately, a change that should give you better performance in games and get a more responsive desktop overall on Linux.</p>
<p>It comes in the form of their new <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler" target="_blank">System76 Scheduler</a>, which they describe as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scheduling service which optimizes Linux's CPU scheduler and automatically assigns process priorities for improved desktop responsiveness. Low latency CPU scheduling will be activated automatically when on AC, and the default scheduling latencies set on battery. Processes are regularly sweeped and assigned process priorities based on configuration files. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/shell/" target="_blank">pop-shell</a>, foreground processes and their sub-processes will be given higher process priority.</p>
<p>These changes result in a noticeable improvement in the experienced smoothness and performance of applications and games. The improved responsiveness of applications is most noticeable on older systems with budget hardware, whereas games will benefit from higher framerates and reduced jitter. This is because background applications and services will be given a smaller portion of leftover CPU budget after the active process has had the most time on the CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Announcing the update that's rolled out on <a href="https://twitter.com/mmstick/status/1488635952327188480" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, System76 engineer Michael Murphy mentioned "There's a Pop!_OS update for pop-shell and system76-scheduler being released that will give CPU priority to the focused window and its sub-processes. Which means improved performance in games, and increased responsiveness in applications".</p>
<p>Our friends at Linux4Everyone asked a question in regards to gaming and how it actually improved it, to which Murphy <a href="https://twitter.com/mmstick/status/1488899547568955398" target="_blank">replied</a>: "QA team had the smoothest VR gaming experience with this, and it gave a boost to framerates. Just a natural side effect of having some finely tuned process priorities that give the focused window (such as a game) a higher priority than background applications and services".</p>

      <title>Valheim getting Steam Deck tweaks, more new content teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim, absolutely one of the best games available natively for Linux is going to get some upgrades for the Steam Deck. Oh, there's also some teased new content so that's cool too. In an official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3124937623694535167" target="_blank">post on Steam</a> celebrating one year since the Early Access release, the team went over some of the details.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, they didn't go into any real specifics on what they're doing other than "We would of course like to have Valheim running smoothly on it from the start, so that’s something we’re working on at the moment.". However, on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsmars/status/1485621788142936067" target="_blank">Twitter</a> one of their developers did show a brief video of it running but the quality of the video makes it hard to see properly. At least we know it should have great gamepad support sometime soon thanks to it!</p>
<p>As for new content, work continues on the Mountain Update with new teaser shots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14814061421643812026gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14814061421643812026gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7155719251643812028gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7155719251643812028gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that work also continues on the Mistlands Biome Update. Sounds like it's still a while away, as they've just now got the "core concept" for it done and so they at least know what they want to put in it. They said " we’re now working on a bunch of new build pieces and enemies, as well as defining more of the new mechanics we will be introducing (though we’d like to keep those secret for a while longer)" and teased some concept art for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12735163541643812116gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12735163541643812116gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I think once these two big updates are out, I'm definitely jumping into a fresh world - what about you?</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk adventure Technobabylon gets a modern native Linux build</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wadjet Eye Games and Technocrat Games have returned with a fresh upgrade of Technobabylon, a 2015 cyberpunk adventure. This follows on from updates / new Linux ports of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/unavowed-from-wadjet-eye-games-arrives-on-linux/" target="_blank">Unavowed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/gemini-rue-gets-a-fresh-and-up-to-date-linux-port/" target="_blank">Gemini Rue</a> and <a class="u-url" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/the-blackwell-bundle-brings-all-the-adventures-back-to-linux/" target="_blank">The Blackwell Bundle</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the other point &amp; click titles they publish, a fresh upgrade of Adventure Game Studio was done and it came with these benefits to Technobabylon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added proper LINUX and MAC ports with WORKING ACHIEVEMENTS!<br/>
- Added Steam Cloud support [cross-platform even]<br/>
- Fixed two crash bugs<br/>
1) Regarding creation of a screenshot.<br/>
2) Regarding a certain individual trying to fade out of existence, fading the game instead.<br/>
- If you want to revert to the older Technobabylon, OPT into beta channel "original", password is "technobabylonold", those saves won't work with this version, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The year 2087 is upon us — a future where genetic engineering is the norm, the addictive Trance has replaced almost any need for human interaction, and an omnipresent AI named Central powers the city. Its all-seeing CEL police force keeps tabs on everyone, including three people who are about to meet their maker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Charlie Regis, an agent of the city’s all-seeing secret police, finds himself blackmailed with the lives of his unborn children. Pushed to the limits by his deceit and his past, how far is he willing to go to save his legacy?</li>
<li>Latha Sesame, a jobless agoraphobe addicted to the Trance, has become targeted for assassination. Without knowing who to trust, she must face the dangers of “meatspace” and survive a fate that has invisibly ruled her entire life.</li>
<li>Max Lao, a tech-savvy case officer who joined CEL to forget her criminal past. Now she finds herself torn between two loyalties. When she’s asked to apprehend her best friend and partner, she must choose to follow her friend or the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>As these three struggle to save themselves, they will soon discover a string of conspiracies that threatens not only their lives, but everything they think they know.</p>

      <title>If you still don&#39;t own Stellaris it&#39;s currently free with Amazon Prime Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quick tip - <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> and Amazon Prime Gaming have teamed up to give subscribers an offer they can't refuse - another free game! Get a copy of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stellaris" target="_blank">Stellaris</a> from Paradox Interactive / Paradox Development Studios.</p>
<p>How to get it? Easy. Just head over to <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a> and click the Games header, then you will see that you can redeem Stellaris on GOG. The offer is open until March 1 and the deal is open to any region that is available with GOG, so you should be good to go. Always nice to get another free game and Stellaris is one where you can happily sink 100s of hours into even without any DLC.</p>

<p>For those who don't mind using the Wine compatibility layer directly they also have World War Z: Aftermath from the Epic Store (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/heroic-games-launcher-for-epic-games-on-linux-adds-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">you can use Heroic</a> for that on Linux!), plus Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on Origin (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/lutris-game-manager-adds-support-for-origin-integration/" target="_blank">Lutris support incoming</a>).</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III gets a nice long official Let&#39;s Play video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is closing in and so Creative Assembly have given us a much longer look at the Daemon Prince of Chaos Undivided. We don't yet know the exact date of the Linux version, with it coming "as close to launch day as possible" with the main release date being February 17.</p>
<p>Check out the new video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CWiAFapYcCI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0c501e99a9d1226687795717558b2c0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CWiAFapYcCI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a reminder: if you do pre-order (or buy in the first week after release) you will get access to an additional free Race Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER III with the Ogre Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Feral Interactive who are doing the Linux port have so far ignored our emails asking for information on cross-platform multiplayer in their version, so we fully expect it to <em>not</em> have online play with the Window build.</p>
<p>You can pre-order from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam announces changes to sales for devs, next set of sale dates up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104662546564716820" target="_blank">announced</a> that they're doing some changes to how developers do sales, plus the next set of Steam sale dates have been announced.</p>
<p>For developers, the time they have to wait between running sales has been <em>decreased</em>. Instead of having to wait six weeks between sales, they now only have to wait four (28 days). Although, this rule does <em>not</em> apply to the four most major site-wide sales being the Lunar New Year, Summer, Autumn, and Winter sales. Valve are also provided developers with a new tool to manage participating in sale events, where developers get a centralized area to see all the events their games qualify to be included in. Sounds pretty useful.</p>
<p>Here's the dates of the next sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Next Fest: February 21-28</li>
<li>Remote Play Together (co-op games): February 28 - March 7</li>
<li>JRPG: March 14-21</li>
<li>SimFest - Hobby Edition (For "games that make hard work into fun".): March 28 - April 4</li>
<li>Die-a-lot (Roguelikes, roguelites, Metroidvanias, etc. Name subject to change): May 2-9</li>
<li>Racing: May 23-30</li>
<li>Next Fest: June, 2022</li>
<li>Summer Sale: June 23 - July 7</li>
<li>Survival: July 18-25</li>
</ul>
<p>Sale dates courtesy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-run-two-sales-a-month-through-till-the-summer" target="_blank">RPS</a>, who said Valve sent it to the press (the dates aren't public). <em>We didn't get the dates, so we must be on a different press list…</em></p>

      <title>CodeWeavers advertising for a Wine developer and Linux gaming tester</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for a job in the Linux space? Now is your chance! CodeWeavers, the company that sponsors development on the Wine compatibility layer and works with Valve on Steam Play Proton are hiring again.</p>
<p>Similar to one they offered before is a "General Wine Developer". This position needs a programmer to hack away on open source to improve Wine's ability to run games and all sorts of other software. CodeWeavers say there's multiple positions available here between working on their own CrossOver UI, Proton for Valve and various other CodeWeavers' stuff. One of the key points though is you cannot have had exposure to Microsoft code or reverse-engineering of Microsoft software, as everything Wine related has to be totally clean-room. This is a remote position, so you can work anywhere.</p>
<p>Don't have coding skillz? Neither do I! However, there's a job for you too. They're also now seeking a Quality Assurance Analyst, basically a "Linux gaming tester" as they say. Sounds like quite a fun role too. Who wouldn't want to get to play games and get paid for it? CodeWeavers say the role is "wide and varied role that includes testing games for multiple projects, crafting testing strategies and managing bugs from discovery to release". This is a local position, you need to be able to commute to their Saint Paul, Minnesota office.</p>
<p>You can check out the jobs on <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/about/jobs" target="_blank">their official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead 2 gets updated ready for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead 2</a> on the upcoming Steam Deck will be a pretty good experience, with Valve pushing out a fresh update today to be ready for it.</p>
<p>Part of all titles getting to the status of Verified, gamepad input needs to be rock solid. Not only that, games need to use the correct controller input icons on-screen too. This upgrade for Left 4 Dead 2 brings all that. Valve of course want their own games to be Verified as much as possible too for their own hardware!</p>
<p>Here's what's changed from the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prevent a crash when creating a depth render target texture with multiple frames</li>
<li>Interface and HUD updates for Steam Deck</li>
<li>Enabled rumble effects through Steam Input</li>
<li>Updated Steam API</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5282500451643802050gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5282500451643802050gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now though, it does have a few issues like a wrong keybind showing and some keybind icon flickering but it's definitely getting there. I did inform one of the developers involved as soon as I saw it, so no doubt it will get fixed it really soon.</p>

      <title>System76 releases the Kudu featuring AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the market for a laptop that combines AMD with NVIDIA, you're in luck with the release of the Kudu from System76. As teased back in early January, it's now available to buy starting at $1,799.</p>
<p>Quite the powerhouse really with the rather good Ryzen 9 5900HX, backed up by some pretty good NVIDIA graphics too. This is a laptop for serious enthusiasts who need some power on the go. Buying from System76 would be a good idea if you want top-class Linux support too, since Linux is their dedication. It also comes with your choice of either Ubuntu or their own Pop!_OS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11264532971643734589gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11264532971643734589gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the short and sweet press release: "The new Kudu laptop combines the latest in AMD mobile computing with discrete NVIDIA graphics," says Ben Shpurker, Product Manager at System76. "This combination makes it the perfect machine for creating on the go."</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 510.47.03 is out adding Vulkan 1.3, GeForce RTX 3050 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for a brand new driver release? NVIDIA has released <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/186156/en-uk" target="_blank">version 510.47.03</a> as a new stable update adding in new features, new hardware support and bug fixes. This is building on top of the NVIDIA 510.39.01 Beta driver released earlier in January.</p>
<p>Some of what's new specifically to <em>this</em> version includes: Vulkan 1.3 support, a new daemon "nvidia-powerd" that provides support for Dynamic Boost, an application profile to get around an image corruption issue in Blender, an installer update for Kernel 5.17 and support for the new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050.</p>
<p>If you're updating from an older release (like the 4xx series) it brings much more like a UI option for setting Image Sharpening in the app profiles section of the NVIDIA Settings app, support for the new Vulkan Dynamic Rendering, AV1 decode support in the NVIDIA VDPAU driver, support for the GBM API, an indicator for Resizable BAR support and various bug fixes + support for more Vulkan extensions.</p>
<p>Since it's a stable driver, you should be good to go on upgrading and gaming with it.</p>

      <title>Selaco will let you turn a vacuum cleaner into a deadly killing machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My excitement over Selaco grows with each little teaser we're shown and now you can weaponize a vacuum cleaner? Damn. Selaco is an upcoming first-person shooter developed with the free and open source GZDoom game engine, the one that powers a ton of Doom mods and total conversions.</p>
<p>Speaking about the teaser the developer said: "There are hundreds of different ways to take care of enemies without having to fire a single shot, which can be discovered through experimentation. One such way is to detach the Turret of a Sentry Gun and attach it to a Roomba instead!"</p>
<p>Check out their new teaser below:</p>

      <title>Aquamarine tries to make survival seem peaceful and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Moebial Studios has released Aquamarine, an underwater survival game that wants you to relax and soak in the atmosphere. <u>Note</u>: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>This is the first title from Moebial, a small international artist collective spread throughout Canada, Brazil, England, and the US. Based in Portland, OR, founder Patric Fallon established the studio in 2017, after years spent developing games on his own as a hobby.</p>
<p>Aquamarine, the developers say, is best played "without distractions" and all your progress is permanent. So, you're going to need to pay attention to any of the choices you make as you progress, as your decisions will be key to your survival. You play as The Seeker, someone sent out to try and find a way for your people to move on and thrive but things don't go as planned of course and your ship ends up crashing into the planet you've come to call Aquamarine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t_S8qkCxby4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9664bb4798d46951806b0d23310e3d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t_S8qkCxby4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Marooned on this ocean planet, you need to find a way back to your ship but there's a lot of ground to cover in between and you need to just generally survive that time too. The key is - how do you do that? Well, Aquamarine is much more of an adventure-puzzle game as it is about survival. There's resources to do with, but a lot of it is calm exploration to learn more about the planet you're on. It's a beautiful game both in terms of the visuals and the audio and they fit really nicely together.</p>
<p>Aquamarine is really like nothing else. The developer may say it's a survival game, and in a way it is, but it's also much like a strategy and puzzle game hybrid. It's turn-based, you need to plan your moves and over time it opens up to give you more to do and see.</p>
<p>The key point of the game is to take it <em>slow</em>, if you go too fast without thinking everything through after <em>very</em> carefully following the tutorial you might end up a little frustrated (as I was before re-doing it). Once you've really got the movement and resources system down though, it's quite a pleasure to soak up. It does need a little experimentation as plenty of it outside the tutorial is left for you to discover.</p>
<p>The Linux native release did initially have a problem with some audio not playing, thankfully the developer Moebial was incredibly responsive and fixed it up so it's working well now. The game as a whole was also a little unstable but once again, Moebial appeared to work very quickly and have repeatedly put up patches that has improved the game quite a lot since the initial release.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/aquamarine" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280750/Aquamarine/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER II for Linux gets the latest big patch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As work on Total War: WARHAMMER II from Creative Assembly winds down in favour of the upcoming Total War: WARHAMMER III, a fresh patch is available in the Linux version. This is likely one of the last patches that will be made for the popular strategy game.</p>
<p>Patch 1.12.1 was originally put live in the Windows version back in early November 2021, so porter Feral Interactive is quite a bit behind on bringing it to their Linux port at the end of January 2022. What's in the patch? The focus was on Cavalry, with an aim to improve their effectiveness across the board, as Creative Assembly said in the big <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/warhammer-2-patch-1-12-1-cavalry-fix/" target="_blank">patch notes post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this update is to improve the effectiveness of cavalry across the board, but especially targetting issues related to being counter-charged by infantry and the underperformance of heavy cavalry.</p>
<p>Several battle gameplay interactions have changed to address the issues that Heavy Cavalry were suffering from. The issue itself stemmed from the interaction between Infantry counter-charging Cavalry; due to the number of entities in an Infantry unit outnumbering Cavalry entities, more attacks were being received on Cavalry than they were able to put out against the Infantry they were charging.</p>
<p>This lead to Cavalry actually trading very poorly against counter-charging Infantry (especially Infantry with high Armour-Piercing weapon strength). This was not intentional so we looked to tweak some interactions to reduce the damage Infantry can do in this situation, and make sure the Cavalry impact felt as strong as you would expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from that, Feral said it also "Fixes a number of minor issues" but they did not go into specifics as usual.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VUJce5B_WdM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce80c2c298143d8ef7f48a655337849a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VUJce5B_WdM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can buy Total War: WARHAMMER II for Linux from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-ii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>As for the upcoming port of Total War: WARHAMMER III, Feral has not replied to our various requests to see if it will have cross-platform multiplayer so we see that as a sign that it will not.</p>

      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution comes to Gamescope for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More preparation work being done for the Steam Deck landed in Gamescope, the Wayland-based micro-compositor, with it <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/360" target="_blank">officially landing</a> support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). This is thoroughly interesting, as the official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/valve-puts-up-official-developer-faq-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck FAQ</a> did mention how Valve planned to have AMD FSR "be included as part of an OS future release".</p>
<p>For those not clued up - Gamescope is what the Steam Deck will use in the main Steam session (not the desktop mode). Any time you load up a game on the Steam Deck normally, it will be run through Gamescope to control the display of it. Behind the scenes Gamescope can do all sorts like spoofing a virtual screen with a set resolution and refresh rate, control the output and resize it, force an FPS limit, allow you to set an FPS limit for the game when unfocused and more.</p>
<p>We don't know yet how the Steam Deck will present an AMD FSR option to players, although it will likely be relatively easy with options built into the Deck UI.</p>
<p>On a traditional desktop Gamescope has many great uses, like dealing with games that have problematic fullscreen modes (since it won't mess with your actual desktop) and a contributor <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/11/testing-integer-scaling-with-valves-gamescope-micro-compositor-for-linux/" target="_blank">previously showed off</a> testing the built-in scaling methods too. For a bit of background, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais did a talk on Gamescope during XDC 2020 that you can check out in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/valve-developer-shows-off-gamescope-for-linux-at-xdc-2020/" target="_blank">another article</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 10:  For I Have Sinned</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-9-ancient-archaeology/" target="_blank">Part 9: Ancient Archaeology</a></strong></p>
<p>It was another shovelware collection that first introduced me to <em>XEvil</em>, in this case <em>300 Arcade Games</em> by Cosmi Corporation made in 2000 for Microsoft Windows. This X11 classic was ported to DirectX by Micheal Judge, with the original game being first released by Steve Hardt in 1994 as a way to teach himself C++ as a sophomore. <em>XEvil</em> would grow in popularity from there, even being the star of organized tournaments similar to those done for <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em> at the time.</p>
<p>The version included on <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> is actually the forked 1.5.5 Mutant Strain with inferior sprite work, worse controls, and choppier performance than the final stable 2.02 release. A controversial opinion in some quarters as the comments section of The Linux Game Tome illustrates, with people bemoaning the loss of the green chopper boys and black aliens, with some even pining for a return to the original black and white graphics.</p>
<p>That final version of <em>XEvil</em> has near feature parity between the Linux and Windows releases, with one glaring omission. The interfaces are a little different but accomplish the same thing, with the Linux version having more graphics options but the Windows version supporting full screen. On Linux smooth scrolling is disabled by default and needs to be toggled due to the performance penalty, but it gave me no problems running on my Pentium III 500 Katmai.</p>
<p>No, the biggest issue is the Linux version does not have any sound. On Windows a memorable MIDI music soundtrack plays that sounds great with my Sound Blaster 16 card, and the sound effects are as much a part of my childhood as the whole rest of the game. <em>XEvil</em> plays the same no matter the platform, but for a game that started out on UNIX it is disappointing that Windows users once again ended up having the better time.</p>
<p>At heart <em>XEvil</em> is a basic deathmatch, but it is the anarchic elements that keep it entertaining. You can end up transmogrified into a frog gifted with built-in lasers, or have the dog whistle spawn facehuggers instead, breeding aliens that fight for you. By playing with the wide assortment of creative weapons, items, scenarios, and classes on offer, anything that can happen will happen. One minute you can be down, the next you can be right back up again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14677509601643411579gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14677509601643411579gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18632054891643435458gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18632054891643435458gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>All of this was well documented on the <em>XEvil </em>website, including detailed character backgrounds providing some backstory on how everyone got sent to Hell. Familiarizing yourself with these is important, as a large part of the game is learning the strengths and weaknesses of the various character classes, and swapping between them as necessary. They are all fighting for their rank in Hell, with the best positions available to those who kill the most.</p>
<p>With a premise like that the game is edgy to the point of unreasonable, but it is done with enough tongue in cheek to keep it from being offensive for the most part. If it were rated by the ESRB it would have warnings for violence, animated blood, suggestive themes, use of drugs, mature humour, and strong language. That being said, one of the scenarios tasks you with saving baby seals, so you can not get too upset with it. Until it tasks you with the inverse.</p>
<p>Sadly the creator made a real deal with the devil to keep the website online in 2017, preserving just a shell with hosting paid for by an awkward segue promoting online casinos. It need not be like this. <em>XEvil</em> is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The burden of the game's future does not need to rest in the creator's now jaded hands. Another with the talent could revive <em>XEvil</em> and bring all of its features back home again.</p>
<p>I am not sure which would be easier, adding a sound layer to the original X Windows version or instead porting the DirectX release over to SDL, but <em>XEvil</em> is worth remembering. It still runs fine on current Linux distributions, and an adaptation for modern compilers and 64 bit machines was posted on GitHub with the version number 2.1 Beta 1. There is no reason <em>XEvil</em> has to die a death, other than its modern obscurity.</p>
<p>Having now explored a whole host of other sidetracks, I think it is about time I went back to the original stated goal I had when first building the computer, and play another title from Loki Software. This time I intend to take full advantage of possessing legacy hardware to play a game that not only does not have a modern source port, it is not even available for sale digitally at time of writing. Even if this particular apple does not fall that far from the tree.</p>

      <title>Portal 2 gets an upgrade ready for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for some more testing? Valve has put up a brand new update for Portal 2 as they ready up for the Steam Deck. As one of their most popular titles, it's no surprise to see upgrades coming in.</p>
<p>ICYMI: Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/half-life-2-getting-a-new-ui-in-prep-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">also updating Half-Life 2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21372539771643654714gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21372539771643654714gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>UI improvements for Steam Deck support</li>
<li>Improved performance of controller polling</li>
<li>Other general in-game performance improvements</li>
<li>Fixed a misaligned stack pointer crash in Miles audio</li>
<li>Fixed input action set selection when switching between game and Puzzle Maker</li>
<li>Fixed some Squirrel engine exploits, reported via HackerOne</li>
<li>Guard against maps with corrupt mark surfaces, caused by some external tools</li>
<li>Update Steam SDK</li>
<li>Updated to <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK Native</a> 1.9.2a</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>DXVK Native is what's used to translate Direct3D into Vulkan, it's a native port of the DXVK project that's used by Steam Play Proton. You can run Portal 2 with Vulkan by adding "-vulkan" as a Steam launch option for the game, as the game uses OpenGL by default on Linux. Hopefully this will help it perform well on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Terraria to get Steam Deck optimizations soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terraria, the side-scrolling platformer survival game from Re-Logic is getting ready for the upcoming Steam Deck launch and it sounds like we can expect a good experience from it. A game that is massively popular, with 48,670 playing it right now on Steam!</p>
<p>It already has native Linux support and it seems they're going to do some tweaks to get it just right on the Steam Deck. Writing in their latest Terraria State of the Game here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funny you should ask! Steam Deck optimizations are nearly complete - in fact, we are likely looking to push those live soon to be ready well in advance of Steam Deck launch in late February. Unless you are playing on Steam Deck, you will not see much difference in this build, outside of a handful of bug fixes, etc. Our team is beyond excited for this new platform, and we have had a ton of fun messing around to try and get things feeling and running "just right" in time for launch. As for what else we have going on - a lot of experimentation continues around the future. After all, we need to be sure that our labors are worthy of your love moving forward, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, work continues on tModLoader which is the open-source, community-driven modification platform for Terraria to improve support for the latest major version of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7157336201643642217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7157336201643642217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Dota 2 on Linux gets upgraded to use the newer Steam runtime container</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hopefully an update that will allow Dota 2 to continue working on Linux and the Steam Deck long into the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/dota-2-to-drop-opengl-and-32bit-vulkan-default-on-linux-and-ti-21-tickets-on-september-22/" target="_blank">Back in September 2021</a>, Valve announced some major technical changes were planned for the Dota 2 client. This included dropping OpenGL support, with Vulkan as the default amongst other adjustments. Part of their plan has now shipped, at least for Linux.</p>
<p>At the bottom of their latest <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/4978168332488878344" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they noted that "As part of our continuing efforts to move Dota's technology forward, we have upgraded the Linux client to use the container version of the Steam runtime. This ensures better compatibility across distributions and prepares for future improvements.".</p>
<p>What is the newer container version of the Steam runtime? This was actually announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/11/steam-for-linux-can-now-run-games-in-a-special-container/" target="_blank">back in November 2019</a>, with the idea to better separate games from your system. It should mean better and continuing compatibility across many different Linux distributions, without dependency headaches. It's the same system that Steam Play Proton also uses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7961902681643638565gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7961902681643638565gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really, you shouldn't see much difference. If you didn't see issues before, you likely won't now. If you did have issues before, it's worth checking it out again.</p>

<p>Up for some exploration? Humble Bundle <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/myst-more-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">has a nice selection</a> of new and old games in the Myst universe. Here's a look at how they can run on Linux.</p>
<p>This is a 12 item bundle and it's actually pretty great value. No native Linux games in this bundle, but looking over them all, it appears they will <u>all</u> work with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. However, some may need Proton-GE for working videos which you can install easily with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/protonup-qt-adds-support-for-lutris-flatpak-new-batch-update-feature/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what's inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Myst: Masterpiece Edition</li>
<li>realMyst: Masterpiece Edition</li>
<li>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</li>
<li>Myst III: Exile</li>
<li>Myst IV: Revelation</li>
<li>Myst V: End of Ages</li>
<li>URU: Complete Chronicles</li>
<li>The Manhole: Masterpiece Edition</li>
<li>Spelunx and the Caves of Mr. Seudo</li>
<li>Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel</li>
<li>10% off Myst (the 2021 remake) in the Humble Store</li>
</ul>
<p>The fun thing is that multiple titles here work through ScummVM, so you can use the data files to run them through a natively installed ScummVM for an even better experience.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/myst-more-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">the full bundle</a> if any interest you. At time of publishing it costs £7.39 for the whole thing.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also these bundles worth a look:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Retro-styled 3D racer Super Indie Karts gets a new &#39;Mission Mania&#39; mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love a bit of Mario Kart or other similar games? Check out Super Indie Karts, which recently had a big content update. Could be a great one to play on the Steam Deck!</p>
<p>Super Indie Karts is a classic retro '90s style karting game featuring a large curation of Indiegame karts and Indiegame themed race tracks, in both the 16-bit flat Super style and the 64-bit low poly Ultra style. With Time Trials, Grand Prix, Splitscreen GP, Quick Race, and a few Battle Modes.. there's plenty of ways to tackle the tracks!</p>
<p>This is the first big update in a while too, here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added "Mission Mania" play mode</li>
<li>Beat missions like "Collect 20 Race Jewels", "Knock over 5 tyre stacks", "Beat a ghost race" etc</li>
<li>Complete the 9 missions in Book1 to unlock a new character!</li>
<li>Added Mission In Snowdriftland Sapphire Cup prologue track</li>
<li>Added Chubby Snow to the racer's roster</li>
<li>Converted scripts of entire project from javascript to c# language - this was a large undertaking but means the project is no longer stuck using the now 6 year old Unity5 engine and should make it a less daunting task to stay updated in future, also upgraded Unity version</li>
<li>plenty of bug fixes and improvements in many areas</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included to get some improvements for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included from Klei Entertainment is a brilliant building sim and it's getting some Steam Deck improvements.</p>
<p>Going over some of their plans for further additions to ONI, Klei put up a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/457140/view/5046848227472826626" target="_blank">roadmap</a> on Steam that sounds pretty great. There's both technical improvements and free content planned, including "support for Steam Deck in the coming weeks". They did just recently fix an issue with the random generation in the native Linux build too. They didn't go into specifics on the Steam Deck changes but it's likely gamepad input support which would be the big one.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also plans for performance improvements, bug fixes and the free content planned for both the base game and the Spaced Out expansion. They teased the free upgrade could include "quirky new Duplicants, new critter morphs, and fresh decor and recreation buildings, all designed to expand opportunities for expressive gameplay".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6072767051643625682gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6072767051643625682gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the ideas we’re exploring for this free content pack include quirky new Duplicants, new critter morphs, and fresh decor and recreation buildings, all designed to expand opportunities for expressive gameplay. This should hopefully be out by the Summer.</p>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Splitgate - Beta Season 1 is out now with a Map Creator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splitgate, the free to play first-person shooter with portals has a big upgrade out now with the start of the first official Beta Season.</p>
<p>This big new update has been in the works for a while, to officially bring an in-game map editor you can make with other players. This gives you full control over everything too like walls, floors, ceilings, weapon pads, objectives and much more. A new official map Hotel, plus an overhaul to the map Foregone Destruction has landed, a new Battle Pass, and there's even two new game modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Flag: Teams take turns defending and attacking the flag every other round</li>
<li>Evolution: Variation of Showdown. Round based with a set weapon loadout, first to 6 points wins. Loadout improves the next round if that team loses.</li>

      <title>STAR WARS: Squadrons looks to be preparing anti-cheat for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Red 5 standing by! How about a little more Star Wars on the go? It appears that MOTIVE and EA and getting ready for the Steam Deck release with tweaks to their anti-cheat.</p>
<p>We don't yet have confirmation of what's happening, and we don't know if it will be a success but they're definitely trying to get it ready. Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1222730/depots/?branch=eac_fix" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> you can see there's an "eac_fix" branch, with a description of "EAC fix for steam deck test branch" - so work is clearly happening (EAC being Easy Anti-Cheat). Being able to play Squadrons on the Steam Deck and online against others sounds like it could be pretty awesome.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nCcfJ9uEwvs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77d34aee5cd3547d61ea673c76432842.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nCcfJ9uEwvs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/easy-anti-cheat-gets-much-simpler-for-proton-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">did say recently</a> that beginning Monday, January 24 they would be sending out Deck Verified data, to those developers who use anti-cheat middleware so perhaps this is the start of more to come? Considering that Easy Anti-Cheat is now easier to support for Linux / Proton and the Steam Deck, and BattlEye is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" target="_blank">just an email away</a>, we're hoping to see lots of titles get working in the next few months.</p>

      <title>Valve has tested &#39;thousands&#39; for the Steam Deck, 60 currently Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a recent update on the Steamworks Group on Steam, Valve gave <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4330775883757445006" target="_blank">an update</a> on Steam Deck Verification and testing appears to be ramping up lately.</p>
<p>Valve confirmed in the post that they have already tested "thousands of titles" for Deck Verified. Their previous focus has been to prioritize titles based on playtime and interest from people who have reserved a Steam Deck, which appears to be an automatic process. They've also now given access to a small set of developers and publishers the ability to directly submit titles for review.</p>
<p>On top of that, they're beginning to increase the amount of titles going through verification, which makes sense considering we're getting close to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/steam-deck-launches-february-25/" target="_blank">Steam Deck release on February 25</a>.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there's now <u>60</u> titles (as of publishing time) that are Deck Verified. Some of the most recent additions to this include: Baba Is You, Daymare: 1998, Hellish Quart, Death Trash, Paint the Town Red, Sam &amp; Max Save the World, Roundguard and Wytchwood. There's a bunch that are also only noted as Playable, due to various issues like launchers, requiring the touch screen for initial setup and others. The number of games you can play with a few minor issues will be much larger overall.</p>
<p>Since they've tested thousands, they're of course not showing the entirety of what is actually Verified yet. Expect plenty more to suddenly appear over this month.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.1 is out with Vulkan 1.3 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the dust has settled on the bottle of Wine 7.0, the biweekly development releases have begun and <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.1" target="_blank">Wine 7.1 is out</a> with new features and bug fixes.

      <title>Wine manager Bottles has a big new release with major overhauls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Managing various games and applications installed on Linux using Wine can be a hassle, and while there's stuff like Lutris available perhaps Bottles might be a better dedicated option just for Wine directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2022.1.28/" target="_blank">Version 2022.1.28</a> has rolled out, with an aim to make the experience more stable thanks to a whole new Wine backend. The new system is split across three components (WineCommand, WineProgram, Executor), that should allow for easy extensions to what Bottles can offer. One useful change with this is that you can run commands without other things interfering (like Gamescope and GameMode).</p>
<p>There's also now the ability to show / hide programs inside each Bottle, their new build of Wine (Caffe) is based on Wine 7.0 with support for the newer Futex2 code, an improved view with a search bar for installers like Epic Games and GOG Galaxy and some other minor features.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20984163171643368443gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20984163171643368443gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A bunch of bug fixes came in too like better Wayland support, fixed desktop entries, the Download Manager should no longer fail due to lack of a User-Agent and the backup import feature should work now too. A few other stability updates also went into it like a dependency issue being solved when creating a new Bottle.</p>

      <title>Gemini Rue gets a fresh and up to date Linux port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wadjet Eye Games continue getting their older published titles upgraded for Linux, after doing the same for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/the-blackwell-bundle-brings-all-the-adventures-back-to-linux/" target="_blank">The Blackwell Bundle</a> we now have a modern port of Gemini Rue for Linux.</p>
<p>"Azriel Odin, ex-assassin, arrives on the rain-drenched planet of Barracus. When things go horribly wrong, he can only seek help from the very criminals he used to work for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the galaxy, a man called Delta-Six wakes up in a hospital with no memory. Without knowing where to turn or who to trust, he vows to escape before he loses his identity completely.</p>
<p>As fate brings these two closer together, we discover a world where life is cheap, identities are bought and sold, and a quest for redemption can change the fate of a whole galaxy."</p>

<p>We of course expect many more to be Deck Verified before the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/steam-deck-launches-february-25/" target="_blank">Steam Deck launch on February 25</a>. It's already quite a nice list of fun titles though. If you also missed it, Easy Anti-Cheat <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/easy-anti-cheat-gets-much-simpler-for-proton-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">recently got easier</a> for developers to support the Steam Deck and Proton.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect: Perfect Storm DLC and The Tower update get a surprise release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven have done a surprise launch of the Prison Architect: Perfect Storm expansion. Plus, as always for Paradox, there's a free update out now too called The Tower. So not only do you have to worry about what the inmates have smuggled around but you now also need to look to the skies. No one wants to sit in a freezing cold cell, or have wild rats running across their feet.</p>
<p>“The calamities in Perfect Storm challenge players to solve problems in creative ways, often requiring them to think ahead when constructing their compound. We’ve worked hard to respectfully present calamities as fun challenges players can overcome using Prison Architect’s signature management gameplay,” says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “Like our past expansions, the calamities are inspired by popular prison fiction seen in shows and films. It’s great if players start thinking about these issues more critically and how they could be solved in the real world.”</p>

Electrician, Cold Control, Fire Safety, First Aid Training, and Pest Removal Training allow staff to mitigate damage and keep things running smoothly.</li>
<li>Granted Refuge - Grants for Disaster Relief, Heatwaves, Emergency Protocol, Subsidence, Advanced Staff Training and Utility Retrofit Grant fund much-needed preparations to help ride out Calamities.</li>
<li>Raining Rats and Dogs - Check current and forecasted weather conditions, and use weather prediction objects, to stay apprised of any impending disasters.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam&#39;s latest crazy indie hit Vampire Survivors is coming to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of Vampire Survivors, an absolute smash-hit on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Steam</a> has confirmed that a Linux version is in the works. Their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3135069454876829117" target="_blank">update post</a> mentioned it might be available by the end of the month, if all goes well.</p>
<p>Developed by poncle, it arrived on Steam in Early Access for Windows on December 17 - 2021 and suddenly on January 6 - 2022 it starting gathering thousands of players. More arrived each day, and this game of complete chaos suddenly managed to be a total hit with an all-time peak player count of 37,075 and that was only hit yesterday so it's continuing to grow all the time. On Steam, it's managed to hit an Overwhelmingly Positive rating too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14233495731643300937gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14233495731643300937gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What is it? A "time survival" game. All you do is run around and try to survive as long as possible, before you inevitably die at some point. Simple gameplay that appears to offer that "just one more run" type of deal.</p>
<p>In regards to it coming officially to Linux, the developer mentioned they're "aiming for Mac and Linux builds by the end of the month" and that an "engine-port project is running in parallel with the development of the current Steam version of the game, so to ease porting to other platforms and ensuring maximum compatibility with the Steam Deck".</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Egosoft continue upgrading their space sim X4: Foundations with the big 5.00 version now in Beta, readying up for the new X4: Tides of Avarice expansion. This free update should release in full with the expansion, and further advances their game engine to provide a better space travel experience.</p>
<p>For some of what to expect in the free update you will see a series of new big capital ships, improved ship models and the big one for fans of performance is the introduction of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). New game mechanics will also come along including ship salvaging and recycling, plus an overhaul to your headquarters. That's just a small slice of what to expect (there's plenty more). Want to test it early? You can! Find out how on their <a href="https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&amp;t=405397" target="_blank">official forum</a>.</p>

      <title>A look at Steam&#39;s top releases of December 2021 on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest report is out from Valve on what was popular and sold well during December 2021. Let's take a look at what to expect from the list in terms of basic compatibility on Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Each month Valve goes over the previous month to show off games doing well, with it including titles across different genres and both Early Access titles and full releases. As usual, it's a mix between native Linux games and those that require running the Windows version through <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>
<p>So here's how they work on Linux. Starting with the ones that <em>do</em> work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/751630/After_the_Fall__Launch_Edition/" target="_blank">After the Fall</a> (VR) - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153640/Chorus/" target="_blank">Chorus</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1341200/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires/" target="_blank">DYNASTY WARRIORS 9 Empires</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1265820/Fights_in_Tight_Spaces/" target="_blank">Fights in Tight Spaces</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/747660/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_Security_Breach/" target="_blank">Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach</a> - Proton, performance not great.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/493520/GTFO/" target="_blank">GTFO</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/" target="_blank">ICARUS</a> - Proton, performance not great.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1619750/Karryns_Prison/" target="_blank">Karryn's Prison</a> (NSFW) - Proton</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716120/Monster_Rancher_1__2_DX/" target="_blank">Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX</a> - Proton, intro videos don't work.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" target="_blank">Ready or Not</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1580240/Rune_Factory_4_Special/" target="_blank">Rune Factory 4 Special</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1094520/Sands_of_Salzaar/" target="_blank">Sands of Salzaar</a> - Proton, may need Proton-GE for videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579380/Shadow_Tactics_Aikos_Choice/" target="_blank">Shadow Tactics: Aiko's Choice</a> - <strong>Linux native</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/377300/Thunder_Tier_One/" target="_blank">Thunder Tier One</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1069660/Ultimate_Admiral_Dreadnoughts/" target="_blank">Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/" target="_blank">Wartales</a> - Proton.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206560/WorldBox__God_Simulator/" target="_blank">WorldBox - God Simulator</a> - <strong>Linux native</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Broken due to <u>anti-cheat</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/918570/Century_Age_of_Ashes/" target="_blank">Century: Age of Ashes</a> - Proton</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549180/Propnight/" target="_blank">Propnight</a> - Proton</li>
</ul>
<p>Just Broken:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1487390/ANVIL/" target="_blank">ANVIL</a> - Proton</li>
</ul>
<p>As expected, most games do not offer native Linux support, so you will continue to need Proton for desktop Linux gaming and for the Steam Deck when it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/steam-deck-launches-february-25/" target="_blank">launches on February 25</a>. Good to see so many working well though! Proton really has come a long way on compatibility.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/top_december_2021?tab=1" target="_blank">list on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 2.0.22 will default to Wayland on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is one of the most important pieces of open source for Linux gamers, as it's the tech used by various game engines and games. It's also about to continue changing the game for the Linux desktop in the upcoming version.</p>
<p>What does it actually do? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware.</p>
<p>It has been announced that the SDL 2.0.22 will default to Wayland, preferring it over X11. This is another big step towards Wayland properly being a replacement for the old and crusty X11 everywhere. With this we might end up seeing more games and applications be native to Wayland, rather than having to run through XWayland.</p>
<p>Developer Ryan C. Gordon (also known as Icculus) mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1486393168211976193" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "If you or your distro has not supplied a libdecor, you absolutely want to get that in place by around March 2022". A lot of the heavy lifting involved was done by Ethan Lee (also known as flibitijibibo), who mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1486408822390509576" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that almost all of the work involved was funded by sponsors of their <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck launches February 25, weekly purchase invites planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The date a great many have no doubt be waiting for, Valve has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3117055056380003048" target="_blank">officially announced</a> their Steam Deck handheld will launch officially on February 25.</p>
<p>It will go by the date each user put in their reservation of course, starting off with the first lucky few who managed to dodge Valve's server issues at the time. The first batch of order invitation emails go out on February 25, and each person has just 72 hours to make the actual purchase before it moves onto the <em>next</em> person in the queue.</p>
<p>As for shipping? Valve say the first lot will go out from February 28 and they plan to send out a weekly invitation for more people to place an order. That actually sounds pretty <em>awesome</em>, so hopefully it will move along reasonably quickly, it certainly sounds like it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20579706231643220497gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20579706231643220497gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve has also confirmed they're arranging for review units to go out to press sites, so keep an eye out for your favourite sites to get their own hands-on time. Additionally, before the release on February 25 we will also see some preview impressions but they didn't say who would be doing it.</p>
<p>Some very exciting times ahead.</p>

      <title>Serious Sam: Siberian Mayhem is out, run it on Linux with one small change</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Serious Sam: Siberian Mayhem is out now as a partnership between Timelock Studio and Croteam. It can run rather well on Linux, although you do need a quick adjustment for <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This is a much shorter and simpler game than previous entries, as it's a sort-of standalone expansion that sits together with Serious Sam 4. Although, going in cold is not a big deal, since it's mostly the usual mindless fast-paced shooting you would expect from a Serious Sam game. The game actually started off life from a modding team, who under guidance from Croteam, turned it into an official game in the series.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RWj7V67b5LQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d9b32c77d273dff66582e8177e683b5c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RWj7V67b5LQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Out of the box, it does <em>work</em> on Linux with Proton and so it will on the Steam Deck too. However, there's <em>no</em> sound. A quick fix is available though! All you need to do is go into the sound settings and select <u>OpenAL</u> as the output instead of the default XAudio. After that, it all works as you would expect.</p>
<p>Performance is a bit shaky though, which is true on Windows as well. Since it's using Croteam's game engine, you can swap Direct3D 11 for Vulkan in the Graphics options to get native Vulkan on Linux (instead of it going through DXVK). In my own testing (at least on NVIDIA), you're definitely going to want to hit the switch to Vulkan too, as it gave a boost of ~20FPS in most cases and was less stuttery too.</p>
<p>It clearly needs some more optimization as a whole though, as other players have also noticed the low GPU usage and micro-stuttering that's completely random even with nothing happening. Most of the time it's okay and good enough to run and gun your way through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3707492161643208311gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3707492161643208311gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You don't get much breathing space, your heart will be furiously pumping and your fingers may begin to ache as it's so fast. Perhaps a little too fast at times, everything feels like someone set a knocked a magical speed dial up. Honestly, it's like you're on roller skates but that is true of most Serious Sam games.</p>
<p>It does the job quite nicely of making you feel like the ultimate bad-ass with no filler — it's all action. Unless you count a few optional side-missions, which are still full of completely insane action. A few dumb one-liners too because what's a hero without that? If that's what you're after, it's thoroughly entertaining.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/serious-sam-siberian-mayhem?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1792250/Serious_Sam_Siberian_Mayhem/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Windjammers 2 is out and it works perfectly on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little flying-disc on the go when you get your shiny Steam Deck? Windjammers 2 is out from Dotemu and it's absolutely brilliant, although I am completely horrible at it. <u>Note</u>: key provided by <a href="https://daredrop.com" target="_blank">Dare Drop</a>.</p>
<p>An evolution of the 1994 Neo Geo arcade game, Windjammers 2 is a sequel decades in the making. Played with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play</a> Proton Experimental on Linux, the experience couldn't have been better - it was honestly just perfect. You face off in one-on-one matches that feels a bit like you're playing Air Hockey and it's absolutely just as manic. Nicely accessible too with easy to grasp controls but it's difficult!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P1zighcAfC0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4aec0719eee51597606ee7069576d690.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P1zighcAfC0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I never played the original to compare notes against but I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with how this turned out.</p>
<p>While it is easy enough to pick up and play, the difficulty comes in mastering the various moves you have available. Like a fighting game, there's plenty of buttons you need to remember. We're not talking about long combinations though, it still manages to keep everything on a pretty level playing field for all involved. That's part of why I particularly liked this one. It's highly competitive, easy to get into and getting good at it will really take time but it's all perfectly streamlined.</p>
<p>Visually it's absolutely stunning too. Vibrant cartoony visuals like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon. It fits the overall theme of the game to perfection.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Spirit of a Classic:</strong> A faithful sequel channeling the lightning-quick battles and responsive action from the original <em>Windjammers</em> that fans fell in love with decades ago.</li>
<li><strong>Hand-Drawn Throwdowns:</strong> Fluid 2D animation converts each match’s intense energy and emotion into a beautiful spectacle that’s a joy to both play and watch.</li>
<li><strong>New Characters, Stages &amp; Moves:</strong> New challengers, courts, and character abilities add variety and new layers of strategy onto the series’ classic competitive action.</li>
<li><strong>Arcade Mode:</strong> Conquer a tournament of matches against AI rivals as well as optional challenges, which reward versatile athletes able to adapt their playstyles on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Approachable Complexity:</strong> Easy to understand mechanics let players of any skill level jump into the fun, with deeply strategic play also available for the fiercest competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Local and Online Multiplayer:</strong> Blaze the court with opponents around the world in ranked online play or quick matches, or take on rivals at home.</li>
<li><strong>Minigames:</strong> Unwind from the competition by chucking a power disc for a canine friend in Hot Dog Distance, or smash through a volley of targets in the all-new Disc Attack.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114290/Windjammers_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's a 10% launch discount until the end of January 27.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2 getting a new UI in prep for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue burning the midnight oil as it's getting close to the Steam Deck launch now. Their classics continue getting updated, with Half-Life 2 getting a new UI.</p>
<p>While they've already added Vulkan support to multiple older titles using DXVK-Native, it appears they're now moving on to make more changes to help players on gamepads work with their games. It makes sense of course, since having their own games work great on the Steam Deck is a must.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11059508301643191748gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11059508301643191748gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5379551581643191749gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5379551581643191749gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can opt into the Beta branch for Half-Life 2 on Steam and set "-gamepadui" as a launch option. Right now though, it doesn't seem to work in the Linux version but does show up when running it with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. It's currently a work in progress. <strong>Update 28/01/22</strong> - the new UI now works in the native version of HL2.</p>
<p>Will be interesting to see if / when they give the same treatment to other titles as needed to get them feeling a little bit more modern. The old grey boxed UI for Valve games is a bit rough now, it didn't age too well.</p>

      <title>The legendary classic Supaplex series comes to Linux on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Supaplex, a game originally released back in 1991 now has multiple modern versions available on Steam and it seems the developers have now added Linux support years later.</p>
<p>Originally created as an extended clone of Boulder Dash, Supaplex is known for its difficulty. By modern standards, there's probably far more exciting puzzle games to look for but as a good bit of nostalgia it seems to do the job just right.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h8Zx3mqe3rs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01b6c51aab418d22d900df6023c970a9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h8Zx3mqe3rs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what I can see, these games are <em>not</em> from the original developers so they're actually remakes. It's not entirely clear how they've been able to use the Supaplex name but it seems no one is around from the 90's to cause a fuss over it.</p>
<p>On Steam they have a few versions of it including Supaplex, Supaplex HARD and Supaplex SQUARES - all of which now have native Linux support and it seems the developers are working towards bringing Linux support to the other titles they have up in the series too.</p>
<p>You can find them all on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=InArcade" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ahead of Dying Light 2, the original Dying Light gets a big event</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have to appreciate the effort Techland has put into supporting Dying Light, giving it new updates and events 7 years after release and now a fresh big event is live.</p>
<p>Spike's Story: Last Call follows the events after the death of a major antagonist but there's plenty of bandits left to take care of. They're flooding Harran in a frenzy and they've hit a survivor shelter, which has resulted in many more Virals in your way. Spike has organised a safe zone but many need help getting there. It's time for you to step in and help as many as possible and for your efforts, you will get a special melee weapon — the Crankshaft. You're not alone this time either, as a bunch of friendly survivors in special protection suits will be around to fight with you. Sounds like a Zombie-smashing good time.</p>
<p>The event, which Techland say is only part one, runs until January 28 19:00 CET / 18:00 UTC. We <em>can't</em> show you the trailer, as YouTube decided it was age-restricted and only allows you to watch via YouTube directly - so it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u5ofxDJAlE" target="_blank">over there</a> if you want to see it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8282304661643218291gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8282304661643218291gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can buy Dying Light from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dying-light-the-following-enhanced-edition?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be checking out Dying Light 2 with Steam Play Proton at release, so stay tuned. Dying Light 2 has pre-orders up on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dying-light-2-stay-human?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/534380/Dying_Light_2_Stay_Human/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for release on February 4.</p>

      <title>The Blackwell Bundle brings all the adventures back to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Point and click adventure fans will be happy as the complete The Blackwell Bundle is now supported on Linux.</p>
<p>Wadjet Eye Games went back and upgraded all entries in the series to either upgrade the existing version and fix Linux issues, re-add Linux support or add new Linux support. On top of that, each game in the series also had an update to fix other reported issues.</p>
<p>"In the Blackwell Legacy, you are introduced to Rosangela as she meets Joey Mallone for the first time and is called upon to investigate a series of mysterious suicides at a local university. An enigmatic killer and a string of seemingly unconnected accidents set the background for Blackwell Unbound. Blackwell Convergence will have you investigating a film premiere that hides a bloody past. In Blackwell Deception you’ll investigate why the customers of various street psychics seem to die under very mysterious circumstances. And finally, in Blackwell Epiphany, you will find out the true reason why Rosa became a medium, and her ultimate destiny."</p>

      <title>Vulkan API 1.3 released, new roadmap and profiles feature</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today is the release of the Vulkan API 1.3 specification update and The Khronos Group has put up a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/press/vulkan-reduces-fragmentation-and-provides-roadmap-visibility-for-developers" target="_blank">press release</a> going over the changes. A vital API for the future of Linux gaming and the Steam Deck of course, with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> using Vulkan for the translation from Direct 3D for DXVK and VKD3D-Proton.</p>
<p>At a glance:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://khr.io/vulkan13spec" target="_blank">Vulkan® 1.3 specification</a> was released today, incorporating and mandating proven, developer-requested extensions to make that functionality consistently available across all supported platforms.</li>
<li>The Vulkan Working Group is developing a public roadmap to provide guidance on when and where more advanced Vulkan functionality will be supported. The Vulkan Roadmap 2022 milestone for mid-to-high-end hardware defines features beyond Vulkan 1.3 that will be available starting this year.</li>
<li>Vulkan profiles will be introduced, with tooling, in the February 2022 Vulkan 1.3 SDK to precisely specify, manage and use sets of API capabilities. Profiles will be used to communicate functionality requirements for roadmaps, markets, platforms, and hardware and software developers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Vulkan 1.3 includes a number of extensions into the main core of Vulkan like dynamic rendering, an improved synchronization API and various other features. Khronos mentioned that no features added in 1.3 are optional to ensure consistency across the industry.</p>
<p>“In this new phase of Vulkan's evolution, the Vulkan Working Group is taking significant steps to reduce fragmentation across the ecosystem and increase Vulkan’s value to the industry as a reliable cross-platform GPU API. We continue to expose new hardware features as extensions while improving the Vulkan API with new core versions that are portable to a wide range of devices. And now with the Vulkan Roadmap, we are committing to enhanced transparency and communication to forge industry consensus on baseline functionality Profiles that best serve Vulkan’s key markets,” said Tom Olson, Vulkan Working Group Chair and Distinguished Engineer at Arm.</p>
<p>Vulkan continues to see industry-wide support from AMD, NVIDIA, Arm, Google and more companies.</p>
<p>On the driver side things are looking to be in pretty good shape. NVIDIA has release their new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> version 470.62.22 which includes a "Fully conformant Vulkan 1.3 implementation".  On the open source Mesa side there's merge requests up for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/14706" target="_blank">Intel ANV</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/14707" target="_blank">AMD RADV</a>. NVIDIA also have their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/vulkan-1-3-broadens-cross-platform-functionality-with-developer-requested-features/" target="_blank">own blog post</a> going over some details.</p>

      <title>Lutris game manager getting Ubisoft Connect integration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is any service safe from Lutris? Apparently not. This impressive free and open source game manager will gain support for another way to install games on Linux in an upcoming update.</p>
<p>Just like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/lutris-game-manager-adds-support-for-origin-integration/" target="_blank">previous article</a> highlighting the upcoming Origin support, this newly introduced Ubisoft Connect is not available in a released build as they code has only recently been added to the <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/commit/33145425e4e986df4b86a055411c093ce71a43bd" target="_blank">GitHub</a> development area. Lead dev Mathieu Comandon once again teased this on Twitter:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7221804741643115003gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7221804741643115003gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once the new release is out it means Lutris will help Linux gamers sort through Steam, GOG, Humble Bundle, Origin, Ubisoft, Epic Games, lots of different emulators and more. It really is turning into the all-you-can-eat of Linux gaming.</p>

      <title>SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE fixes up Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE had a small patch released today and it seems they're another developer hoping to see their game fully verified for the upcoming Steam Deck handheld from Valve.</p>
<p>This first-person shooter is built on the foundation of the original hit SUPERHOT, where time moves in slow motion until you make a move. It's a huge amount of fun and it's highly replayable thanks to it having basically more of everything. It seems like a game that would be great to have on the go.</p>
<p>In the small update release today the developer mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• Steam Deck compatibility<br/>
• unified save names for PC - MAC/Linux<br/>
• bug fixes (including Infinite lvl 90 lock)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't go into any detail, that's it. Still nice to see though. The unifying of save names is a big one actually for the Steam Deck, since the majority of PC gamers still use Windows. For people switching between Windows and a Steam Deck (Linux) - you want your saves to match. So let this be a reminder to other developers, keep your saves named the same.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for Epic Games on Linux adds gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making things even easier for the upcoming Steam Deck, the unofficial Heroic Games Launcher for Epic Games can now be navigated with a gamepad. Testing it out today, it works really nicely too. Just goes to show what amazing things a community can do, even when Epic doesn't support Linux directly with their store.</p>
<p>You even get a nice on-screen keyboard show up for text input - very nice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11067940651643107886gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11067940651643107886gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Other improvements in the Heroic 2.1.0 release include the app remembering window size and position, CTRL+F shortcut for the search bar in the library, a new Wine Downloader feature to easily get new versions of Wine-GE and Proton-GE, the app will check the status of Epic's servers and give warnings on issues and a few other assorted UI updates and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Work is still <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/515" target="_blank">in progress</a> to support Flatpak / Flathub, once that is done installing this on a Steam Deck or any other Linux distribution should be super-simple.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>We&#39;re living in a weird world with Sony&#39;s Shuhei Yoshida excited about a Linux handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes it feels like I've somehow fallen through the multiverse into a very different and thoroughly weird world. When Valve put Steam on Linux back in 2013 (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">see our full history</a>), who could have imagined what that would bring us many years later?</p>
<p>At the end of February the Steam Deck should be releasing to the lucky first few who managed to get their reservation in (not me), ushering in a new era of PC gaming on the go. A Linux handheld. Powered by SteamOS 3, Valve's latest bundling of Steam with open source based on Arch Linux. Excitement levels keep rising every time Valve announce something new, but its the posts from developers we keep seeing with units that really gets us excited.</p>
<p>When you have the likes of Shuhei Yoshida, the Head of Sony PlayStation Indies (and former President of SCE Worldwide Studios), putting up a clearly very excited <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1484010884292698116/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter post</a> showing off a previously PlayStation <em>exclusive</em> running on a Linux handheld (the Steam Deck), you know something big is brewing that's about to be unleashed on the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7007083871643103026gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7007083871643103026gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - God of War on a Steam Deck, credit: Shuhei Yoshida</em></p>
<p>The gaming landscape is ever-changing but the past few years felt bigger than before. Sony are allowing more previously exclusive games to leave their platform, Microsoft are doing the same and now thanks to the likes of <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> - we even get to play them on desktop Linux. Seeing an Xbox Studios or PlayStation Studios logo shine brightly on a Linux box is just such a strange feeling. Thanks to Valve again, we shall soon even see that on the go or on the toilet.</p>
<p>It absolutely is going to be the year of Linux on the de…Steam Deck. Please don't let the multiverse send me back to whatever boring world I came from, I don't want to get off this ride.</p>

      <title>Dynamic Cloud Sync to let you easily switch between PC and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced the latest upgrade to help players with a Steam Deck. It's called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3142949576401813670" target="_blank">Dynamic Cloud Sync</a> and will let you easily switch between your PC and a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The idea is that when you enter suspend mode on the Steam Deck, like you might with other consoles, the Steam Deck will then upload any modified save data to the Steam Cloud ready to be picked up anywhere else. When you wake the device, it will then automatically download any changes ready for you to carry on.</p>
<p>Valve say this is not a requirement but they "recommend" developer use it to give players the best experience possible. Without it though, there may be problems as Valve say: "Without Dynamic Cloud Sync enabled, Steam will still track when save game data is changed on the Steam Deck. However, any user who suspends their Deck while your game is running and then tries to resume that game on a different device, will be prompted to first return to their Deck to close the running process or continue without their most recent save game progress".</p>
<p>It's free to use but not automatic so developers must do some work to take advantage of it. This includes new integrations into games, which is where some problems may arise. This has been announced really close to the release of the Steam Deck, which of course is not ideal for developers who are often already overworked. Are many likely to go back through their older titles to add it in? It doesn't seem overly likely.</p>
<p>FNA developer and game porter Ethan Lee mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1485743783329337350" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Considering an overwhelming majority of titles I see use autocloud I'm hoping sleep mode triggers a transaction and resuming makes it go 'we detected new save data from another PC, do you want to restart the game?' because no way is anyone going into their back catalog for _this_".</p>
<p>Developer Tyler Glaiel (The End is Nigh, Bombernauts, The Basement Collection and more) also seemed <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1485738462560980994" target="_blank">unimpressed</a> on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1485744272095670273" target="_blank">too</a>.</p>
<p>It is more work for developers but hopefully over time it will become something developers think on during development. As players, we can just hope developers find easy enough ways to implement it and share that with others.</p>

      <title>DXVK 1.9.4 is out as Valve prepares Proton 7.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Vulkan-based implementation of D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 for Linux / Wine named DXVK (used with Proton) has a 1.9.4 version release, plus it appears that Proton 7.0 is closing in. More info on Steam Play Proton on our <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>DXVK 1.9.4 is quite a small one simply preparing for the next Proton release, here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that would cause VRAM to not be utilized on RBAR-enabled Nvidia GPUs if the <code class="inline-code">dxvk.shrinkNvidiaHvvHeap</code> option is enabled (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2438" target="_blank">#2438</a>).</li>
<li>Enabled strict D3D9 float emulation by default on future versions of RADV. This may improve both accuracy and GPU-bound performance (PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2448" target="_blank">#2448</a>).</li>
<li>Improved memory allocation behaviour. This may reduce memory usage especially in games that create multiple processes or D3D devices.</li>
<li>Removed obsolete options to disable OpenVR support.</li>
<li><strong>God of War</strong>: Enabled performance optimizations and DLSS support. <em>Note that these changes are already included in Proton Experimental.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More exciting is that it appears we shall be getting a new version of Proton soon, which will be rebased on the most recent Wine 7.0 release. You can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1493710/history/?changeid=13748510" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that the Proton team has been preparing it with a currently private Release Candidate in testing too. This should hopefully bring more compatibility for Windows games ready for the Steam Deck to release in February.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 Alpha 1 is out with Vulkan support, rendering overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free and open source game dev tech Godot Engine is jumping up a few levels today with the absolutely massive release of Godot Engine 4.0 Alpha 1. This is going to change the game in huge ways.</p>
<p>This version has been in development for multiple years, with an aim to bring Godot closer to the graphical power and standards being set by the bigger lot (Unity / Unreal etc). All work being done has been in addition to the usual updates to the 3.x branch that is still ongoing too. Godot 4 though brings with it massive changes to the very core of Godot.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5987842931643039925gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5987842931643039925gol1.jpg"/></a>3D Scene example from Godot 4 with reflections</em></p>
<p>Some of the major additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulkan API support with two backends:
	<ul>
<li>Clustered - for desktop.</li>
<li>Vulkan Mobile - speaks for itself, but also supports desktop - meant for simpler games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Absolutely masses of new graphics features like: specular mapping when using 2D lighting, fully real-time VoxelGI, signed distance field-based global illumination (SDFGI) for open world lighting, volumetric fog with optional GI contribution, new GPU-based lightmapper and the list goes on.</li>
<li>Shader compiler rewritten from scratch.</li>
<li>Major text rendering upgrades, with right-to-left language support.</li>
<li>Overhaul to importing 3D assets, with a big speed bump too.</li>
<li>New TileMap and TileSet editors with better usability.</li>
<li>Godot Physics system to replace Bullet.</li>
<li>Support for multiple windows of the Editor.</li>
<li>GDScript was rewritten from scratch with a cleaner approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the full announcement post on the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-1" target="_blank">Godot blog</a>. A full list of changes is still being put together that you can see <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#40---tbd" target="_blank">up on GitHub</a> and it's pretty long!</p>

      <title>Steam broke its own record for online users once again, hitting 29 million</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend it seems that Steam once again managed to break some records. Where do all these new people keep coming from? Only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/there-it-is-steam-breaks-28-million-users-online/" target="_blank">two weeks or so</a> ago Steam just hit 28 million online, now it's already blasted through 29 million to hit a new high of <strong>29,201,174</strong>.</p>
<p>At that time there we 8,505,375 people actually in-game too, which is a nice bump over when the previous record hit so it's clearly not just people idling away.</p>
<p>What was popular this time with players? Mostly the usual suspects, with one newcomer being Yu-Gi-Oh:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG: Battlegrounds</li>
<li>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
</ul>
<p>What do we think, an easy 30 million+ online by the end of 2022? Absolutely, considering the way it's been repeatedly smashing through it wouldn't be a surprise to see it hit 35 million by end of year. When you take the Steam Deck into account, there's going to be more people playing on the go too keeping the numbers up perhaps even more.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that competition elsewhere certainly hasn't eaten much into Steam's user-base.</p>

      <title>Lutris game manager adds support for Origin integration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source game manager Lutris continues expanding the stores it supports installing games from, with Origin now being added into the mix. Currently Lutris supports installing games (both native Linux builds and Windows games with Wine) for Humble Bundle, GOG, Steam, Epic Games and Emulators so adding Origin sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>No new release is actually out with it yet, as the code has just been added into the current development area on <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Lead dev Mathieu Comandon teased it on <a href="https://twitter.com/MComandon/status/1485207577193431040/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Origin integration for Lutris is now available on the development branch!".</p>

      <title>Valve sponsors more work to improve Linux graphics drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More improvements will be coming to Linux graphics drivers, as Valve have sponsored work towards continuous integration (CI) testing. Focused on AMD GPUs of course, since that is what the Steam Deck will be using so it's good news for both the Linux desktop and Valve's upcoming handheld.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/14660" target="_blank">Draft Merge Request</a> created by Igalia developer Charlie Turner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This series proposes to add more dEQP bare-metal runners, sponsored by Valve. For now the runners are conditioned on a selection of users (similar to how freedreno's restricted traces work), since there are not enough machines to hit the runtime targets required for inclusion in the automatic pre-merge pipelines. There's nothing secret about the test loads, the restriction is purely practical for now and any interested user may request access to the runners.</p>
<p>A follow-up series will add trace testing runners to the CI, using a similar approach to the above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>dEQP (drawElements Quality Program) contains tests for multiple graphics APIs and should hopefully pick up issues <em>before</em> they end up going out to the public driver releases. All part of the work towards keeping Mesa Linux graphics drivers running smoothly. There is only so much developers can test directly on owned hardware, and CI testing is essential towards reducing the burden of that (and it's used across many computing fields).</p>
<p>All good news, and should keep getting better.</p>

      <title>RetroArch 1.10.0 out with Vulkan fixes, Wayland improvements, GameMode support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The RetroArch frontend application for emulators, game engines and media players has a new release up and there's plenty of great sounding improvements for Linux users. This should make it play even better with the Steam Deck!</p>
<p>Netplay was a particular focus for <a href="https://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-1-10-0-release/" target="_blank">RetroArch 1.10.0</a>. Their relay system to help players connect together is now online, along with some improvements like adding custom relay server support. uPnP support also had a "complete overhaul".</p>
<p>Specifically for Linux there's a couple of Wayland improvements like ignoring mouse clicks on window decoration and scroll wheel support. There's now support for libdecor for client-side decorations, a fix for window closing, the window title correctly updates on Wayland and more minor fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10039760021643019815gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10039760021643019815gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A couple of Vulkan API improvements came in too like: double combined image sampler descriptor pool size, fixing segfaults with AMD GPUs using RADV; emulate mailbox only with Vsync enabled, otherwise have it disabled which is useful for VRR/G-Sync/FreeSync and also Vulkan max swapchain images option adjustments: removed value 1, since it won’t be used – Video reinit on change, so that there is no need to restart or toggle fullscreen.</p>
<p>Plus, support for <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" target="_blank">GameMode</a> was added directly into the RetroArch UI.</p>
<p>The other major addition is HDR support but that's not currently for Linux, since we don't have HDR yet.</p>

      <title>The 2012 strategy game Oil Rush from Unigine is now free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released all the way back in 2012, Oil Rush from Unigine is a naval strategy game and they've now decided to set it free by removing the price. Back at release, it was probably one of the most graphically demanding games available for Linux at the time, feels like it's part of our history at this point.</p>
<p>Why is it free now? Tomorrow, January 25, it's the tenth anniversary of the release. Writing about it the developers said: "It's been 10 years since the release of UNIGINE's first game. We want to pay tribute to the thing that showed the world not only what our product is capable of, but also became an evidence of our team’s abilities. Oil Rush made us acknowledge our potential, opened a lot of doors for us and showed us opportunities that we’ve been taking ever since.</p>
<p>A decade went by, we’re working on a new yet unannounced game, and it feels like there came the time to set Oil Rush free."</p>

<p>The release and early builds were back in the day when Canonical were trying to build up the Ubuntu Software Center, with it having a pre-order available there. Not only that, it was also available on Desura, one of the original indie stores that had a native Linux client before being sold off multiple times and eventually shut down.</p>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Oil Rush</strong> is a naval strategy game that takes place in a world where nuclear war has melted the ice caps, changing the face of the planet forever. Oil Rush offers unique gameplay, avoiding micromanagement of every single unit, while still providing full control over all important aspects of strategy and economy.<br/>

      <title>Quake II RTX 1.6.0 adds AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quake II RTX from Lightspeed Studios and NVIDIA just recently gained another big upgrade, this time with some AMD tech thanks to community-provided code. This is possible since it's <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX" target="_blank">open source</a>. Still quite surprising though but goes to show how people just want to make gaming better, regardless of hardware vendor politics.</p>
<p>With the release of Quake II RTX 1.6.0 it didn't just bring AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) but upgraded many parts of the game with new features too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15860005661643015272gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15860005661643015272gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other improvements include a removal of the NVIDIA Vulkan Ray Tracing extension, since it has been replaced by the vendor neutral extension now. Bigger additions came with support for nearest filtering on world textures, making any models translucent, polygonal light extraction from MD2/MD3/IQM models, smooth normals on the world mesh through a BSPX extension, support for unlit fog volumes and more new features.</p>
<p>You can also now change VSync without reloading the renderer, they extended the supported light style range to 200% to fix over-bright lighting, improved CPU performance, added anisotropic texture sampling for objects seen in reflections and refractions using ray cones, improved the handling of transparent effects in the acceleration structures and the list goes on. That's not even getting to community contributions like the aforementioned AMD FSR, saving and loading games in expansion packs, better support for old mods and enabled x86 builds of the dedicated server, improved behavior of Dynamic Resolution Scaling on map changes and so on.</p>
<p>All sounds pretty great. Quake II RTX is turning into quite the playground of graphics tech.</p>
<p>You can play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1089130/Quake_II_RTX/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Quake II RTX on Steam</a>. The first 3 levels are free but to play the rest with it you also need to buy the original Quake II.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s now an official Ubuntu MATE build for GPD Pocket 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The GPD Pocket 3 is a fully-featured modular pocket PC and now you can happily run Linux on it with an <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-for-gpd-pocket3/" target="_blank">officially released</a> build of Ubuntu MATE. Something of a tradition for the MATE team who have produced builds for previous versions of the GPD devices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12197930371643014756gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12197930371643014756gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's some of the work that went into ensuring it works well:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enable frame buffer and Xorg display rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerometer support for automatic screen rotation.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Also automatically rotates touch screen and stylus (draw and erase)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable <strong>fractional scaling by default</strong>
<ul>
<li>Results in an effective resolution of ~1280x800 to make the display panels easily readable.</li>
<li>Simple to toggle on/off via the <em>Display Scaler</em> app if you want to restore full resolution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable audio via the HDaudio legacy driver.</li>
<li>Suspend is implemented via <code class="inline-code">s2idle</code>
<ul>
<li>A temporary workaround until S3 sleep state is supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable scroll wheel emulation while holding down the centre trackpad button.</li>
<li>Enable Tear-Free rendering by default.</li>
<li>Enable double size console (tty) font resolution.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One current downside is that the fingerprint reader does not work.</p>

      <title>Easy Anti-Cheat gets much simpler for Proton and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3137321254689909034" target="_blank">announced</a> that developers who use Easy Anti-Cheat for their games now have a much easier setup for Proton and the upcoming Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/easy-anti-cheat-not-as-simple-as-expected-for-proton-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">wrote about recently</a>, it turned out that the announcement from Epic Games on supporting Easy Anti-Cheat for Proton was not as easy as expected. It required an SDK update for Epic Online Services, something developers noted was not exactly simple.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve has been doing more with Epic behind the scenes and the process is now much better, which should hopefully mean more developers will be able to do it. Valve has now expanded the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/proton" target="_blank">developer documentation</a> noting how Easy Anti-Cheat can be hooked up with Proton:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Proton supports Easy Anti-Cheat without requiring any recompilation, but it does require you to manually enable support for your build by following these steps in order:
	<ol>
<li>Go into the EAC settings on the EAC partner site and enable Linux support from the dashboard.</li>
<li>Once that's done, download the EAC Linux library (<em>easyanticheat_x64.so</em>) for the SDK version integrated with your game, and add it to your depot next to the Windows library (<em>EasyAntiCheat_x64.dll</em>).</li>
<li>Lastly, on the Steamworks site, publish a new build of your game containing the new depot contents. (You don't have to make any changes to the game executable, just include the new files in the depot contents.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve states that starting Monday - January 24, they will begin sending out Deck Verified data to developers that use anti-cheat to notify them of the results. Once they get it, developers will have a week to accept it (broken or otherwise) or do the necessary work to get it sorted.</p>
<p>So, if all goes well, we might in the next few weeks see more anti-cheat enabled titles working on Linux with Proton. This would be great for the Steam Deck, since it ships with SteamOS 3 Linux.</p>
<p>Just some of the titles that could benefit include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Back 4 Blood</li>
<li>Dead By Daylight</li>
<li>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</li>
<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</li>
<li>New World</li>
<li>Paladins</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2</li>
</ul>

      <title>Framework put up the source code for their Embedded Controller firmware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to put their money where their mouth is, the team at Framework are keeping things open and they've just announced the source code release for their Embedded Controller firmware.</p>
<p>What they're using is actually based on Google's chromium-ec project, which is the EC firmware used in Chromebooks. They've put the code up on <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/EmbeddedController" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the BSD license. They didn't have to do this but it's great to see and keeps up with their commitment to allow people to do whatever they want with the Framework Laptop, which is one of the most exciting laptops we've seen for some time now.</p>
<p>The Embedded Controller is what talks with low-level stuff like power sequencing, keyboard control, thermal control, battery charging and so on.</p>
<p>Missed the news on Framework? It's a laptop that will come in two editions, and they fully support Linux with it too. The DIY edition comes with no operating system, and you get to build it yourself. It's really cool. It's modular, upgradable and the expansion card system looks great giving you tons of options for connectivity.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19298373961642789026gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You will also find that their team has put up a few official Linux guides too like for <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Fedora+35+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop/108?lang=en" target="_blank">Fedora 35</a>, <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Ubuntu+21.10+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop/109?lang=en" target="_blank">Ubuntu 21.10</a>, and <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Manjaro+21.2.1+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop/111?lang=en" target="_blank">Manjaro 21.2.1</a> and they said more will be added over time. For now they're suggesting Fedora 35 for the best out of the box experience.</p>
<p>They're currently accepting orders and pre-orders for multiple countries. The Framework Laptop starts at £999 but the DIY Edition is configurable from £749.</p>
<p>See more about Framework on the <a href="https://frame.work" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD Ryzen DeskMini UM700 announced with Manjaro Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Manjaro Linux folks have teamed up with Minisforum to bring a very small but quite mighty system with the DeskMini UM700 × Manjaro Linux. Exciting? Well, it's basically rebrand of the existing EliteMini UM700 only it has Manjaro Linux instead of Windows 10 - and the first 1,000 orders get a free copy of CrossOver Linux.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this is pretty much the same box that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/valve-adds-documentation-for-steam-deck-development-suggests-manjaro-linux-for-now/" target="_blank">Valve showed a pictured of</a> them using in their developer documentation when talking about sorting a system for developing for Steam Deck without a Dev-Kit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2301343031642783933gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2301343031642783933gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For a currently discounted price of $499, which they show will be $599 after, you get this:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Processor</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>What's the price like though? Well, for the base model that gives 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD you're looking at a special launch price of $499. It shows the normal price would be $599, which is actually more expensive than the Windows version that comes with 16GB RAM ($569).</p>
<p>The version of CrossOver included is the "Linux One" package. Giving you a full license to the <em>current</em> version of Crossover Linux with <em>no</em> upgrades or help desk support. It's no longer sold by CrossOver directly, only for promotions now like this.</p>
<p>Does sound like a nice little machine overall. However, something else that's also strange is their branding. DeskMini is actually an ASRock thing, so Minisforum are being pretty cheeky here.</p>

      <title>Flathub to verify first-party apps and allow developers to collect monies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> and Flatpak packages are the future of Linux apps, according to more people, and GNOME are continuing to invest in it. They have some big plans to improve it too.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2022/01/21/further-investments-in-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">new blog post</a> on the GNOME Foundation website, they went over a number of things and not just Flathub related but that's what we're going to focus on for this article. The plans actually sounds pretty good!</p>
<p>Firstly, Flathub is going to gain a way to process and verify apps from first-party teams. As in, developers who directly publish their app and manage the Flatpak package process for Flathub. A way to actually properly distinguish official apps from community builds will be quite important for so many reasons (security, privacy and so on). Not only that but GNOME want to give developers a way to collect donations and subscriptions too, which is also important to help make it more sustainable. Sounds like it's possible a way will be added for developers to share some of the revenue with Flathub too, ensuring it too is sustainable.</p>
<p>To improve the experience further another part of the plan is to support multiple repositories, to enable a split between these first-party apps and community contributions, and have one where only free and open source apps live. That way, users get more of a choice on what they see and it just gives a little more control over all. Part of the hope is that they can get GNOME Software and KDE Discover to support all this, and note it all like verify apps and such. Think of it like see a nice big blue tick in whatever software store you use to see clearly it's official.</p>
<p>You can see the plans in a bit more detail on their original <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/seeking-contractors-for-work-on-flathub-project/1889" target="_blank">Discourse post</a>.</p>
<p>Also be sure to check out a pretty good video overview on Flatpak from Nick at The Linux Experiment:</p>

      <title>HITMAN 3 arrives on Steam and works flawlessly on Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for the Steam Deck. IO Interactive have finally put HITMAN 3 on Steam, after the Epic exclusive period has finished and it works out of the box on Linux with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Concluding the Agent 47 saga, the Steam release of course had its own drama to deal with. While it has been out for a year already on the Epic Store (which doesn't support Linux at all), it arrived on Steam at full price which has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. Add to that the thoroughly confusing and <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1484239055080538123" target="_blank">long list</a> of packages for HITMAN 3, plus Humble Store being required to separate between Epic / Steam (with the Epic version at 50% off but Steam is not) - the result added together was not a good one for IO.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14629558851642769154gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14629558851642769154gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They've made the same mistake as previous entries with overwhelming choice. Even I was confused by it. They don't even properly explain anywhere on the Steam store, that if you own either (or both) HITMAN 1 / HITMAN 2 on Steam, you don't actually need the DLC for their missions as you will get them automatically when you first properly load it up (as I confirmed myself). You only find that out if you go to the Steam forum.</p>
<p><em>If you don't want or don't care about the previous two games, there is a "story so far" cinematic to bring you up to speed.</em></p>
<p>For Linux fans the good news is that HITMAN 3 runs out of the box on Linux tested with Proton Experimental. Videos and all, everything just works. So, it may be late to Steam but it now makes it a click away to game on Linux and so for the Steam Deck too - which is fantastic news.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9345538101642778972gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9345538101642778972gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Considering the performance on my system, it should have no problem performing well on the Steam Deck. It's <em>incredibly</em> smooth, so it seems on the technical side IO actually did a genuinely good job at optimizing the game to begin with. I've not encountered any major stuttering, which I did see when testing HITMAN 2 with Proton originally. It also goes to show how far Proton has come in a couple years to be this good now.</p>
<p>If you've not played the series before it's actually thoroughly entertaining. Every level is a big sandbox for you to deal with this mission how you see fit. HITMAN is a game about stealth though, so going in hot with a big weapon is not something you're going to be doing often (or at all). Gain intel, listen in on conversations and gradually make your way towards targets to eventually take them down. Some missions can take hours to do depending on how elaborately you wish to take people down.</p>
<p>Something to note is that HITMAN 3, like the others before it, does need you to be online. There is a single-player offline mode but it's very limited.</p>
<p>If you're a Humble Choice subscriber, you can at least get 20% off on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hitman-3-steam?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>. Otherwise it's full price on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> but there is a demo if you wish to give it a test.</p>

      <title>Game devs don&#39;t seem convinced on the Steam Deck from the GDC 2022 survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The annual game developer survey from GDC is <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2022" target="_blank">out now for 2022</a> and it has some interesting insights as usual. That includes thoughts on the upcoming Steam Deck, with it clearly not selling everyone.</p>
<p>Having a little browse through it today and here's a few things to stuck out to me. For starters, of the ~2,700 developers surveyed about 7% said they are currently developing for Linux. Interestingly, 8% said their <em>next</em> project would be developed for Linux. When it comes to what platform developers are most interested in, Linux sat at 7%. As expected all three of those saw "PC" as the top platform, which by that they of course mean specifically Windows.</p>
<p>Stadia, Google's once promising cloud gaming solution doesn't seem to be really getting any love with it seeing 3-5% in those same questions. Streaming just doesn't seem all that popular with developers, with even Xbox Project xCloud (now just called Xbox Cloud Gaming) also seeing pretty low percentage interest from developers.</p>
<p>Browser-based gaming is here to stay though, as according to the survey it seems 9-11% of developers are currently doing it or planning to do it.</p>
<p>What about the Steam Deck though? The question posed was "Do you think Valve Software’s Steam Deck will be a viable game platform in the long term?" and only 36% said yes with 17% saying no and the rest unsure. Some of the developer comments were interesting on the Steam Deck ranging from excitement about "a product gamers have wanted for a long time" to saying they "don’t think it will deliver anything revolutionary that isn’t currently being delivered by the Switch".</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is interesting, as any developer / publisher we've seen actually receive a devkit unit has been practically universally praising the device. Seeing is truly believing then.</p>
<p>How about VR? Well, the majority (40%) are currently <em>developing</em> for Oculus devices. Interest seems reasonable for the Valve Index and HTC Vive, which support Linux, as 20% said they were currently developing for those. The VR market does <em>not</em> sound healthy from the responses though, with an increasing amount of developers who previously worked on VR now <em>not</em> working on <em>any</em> games.</p>
<p>A divisive one is NFTs and the (good) news there is that 70% of developers said they were not interested, with only 21% being "somewhat interested" and 7% being "very interested" and 1% already using them. Some of the responses there made me laugh ranging from it's "the wave of the future" to the blunt "How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me".</p>

      <title>Kitsune Tails gets an all-star voice cast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitsune Tails is an upcoming LGBTQ-focused retro story platformer from Kitsune Games and MidBoss, LLC. that's due out later this year. Looks great for platformer fans and it's going to have quite the voice cast.</p>
<p>There's what seems like a nice big mix of people getting involved with Kira Buckland (the voice of iconic NiEr: Automata protagonist 2B, Street Fighter V’s Falke, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean’s Jolynne Cujoh) plus Angela Tran (Genshin Impact, Lake, Summer in Mara), Katlyn Dannes (The Homework's Revenge: Esther in Wonderland and Square Roots), Brent Mukai (Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Pokemon Masters) and more.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wqhz5PHtwGg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76e059b4962a1e13ce2d1948d3f3977d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wqhz5PHtwGg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the PR: "Auditioning so many talented voice actors to help bring the world of Kitsune Tails to life was rewarding and a challenge to determine who was the right fit," said Emma 'Eniko' Maassen, Kitsune Games founder. "The fact we got the talent behind 2B to voice Yuzu is still surreal to me, and we hope our fans enjoy this taste of what’s to come!"</p>
<p>The game will serve as what they say is a spiritual successor to Super Bernie World, which gathered over 300,000 downloads across itch.io and Steam. A crowdfunding campaign will launch in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic platforming action set in a land inspired by Japanese mythology</li>
<li>Explore five elemental worlds and various haunted houses</li>
<li>Learn new elemental powers and use them to find secrets and optional story content</li>
<li>Unlock a bonus ending by fully exploring the relationships between characters</li>
<li>Use cute outfits to power up or stomp around by stealing a giant boot from enemies</li>
<li>Defeat your haughty former mentor and her gang of foxy minions</li>
<li>Stomp on pangos to make them curl into a ball, pick them up, and kick them around</li>
<li>Carry lights through haunted houses to reveal secret doors and ward off ghosts</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. At release it will also be on <a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Steering Wheel manager Oversteer expands supported wheels in 0.7.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/berarma/oversteer" target="_blank">Oversteer</a> continues to be the best way to setup and configure Steering Wheels on Linux. Oversteer 0.7.0 is out now and expands support for more wheels. Since, like a lot of other special hardware, the original manufacturer doesn't support Linux, community efforts like this are essential.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Logitech G923, Thrustmaster T150 and T500RS to the list of supported wheels.</li>
<li>Added German, Finnish and Turkish translations.</li>
<li>Install udev rules by default in more sensible locations.</li>
<li>Bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I can easily attest to how great it is and how it really does make it simple. It continues working great with my own Logitech G29 to help adjust various settings. Depending on what hardware you have, Oversteer supports a lot. Features include emulation mode support, rotation range, force feedback gain, device profiles, the ability to combine accelerator/brakes pedals for games that use just one axis. If you combine it with the <a href="https://github.com/berarma/new-lg4ff" target="_blank">new-lg4ff driver</a>, you get even more features.</p>

      <title>Stellaris 3.3 Unity gets a Beta available on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive are gearing up ready for the next major update to their space strategy game Stellaris. A new opt-in Beta is available for the 3.3 Unity update.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of work to be done to finish the update with it still in active development, however this is your time to get in early and see what's new and report any issues. Currently some new localization strings are only in English and there's some placeholders but there's a lot of new features and reworks.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the major changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All means of increasing Administrative Capacity have been removed. While there are ways to reduce the Empire Sprawl generated by various sources, empires will no longer be able to completely mitigate sprawl penalties. Penalties and sprawl generation values have been significantly modified.</li>
<li>The Edicts Cap system has been removed. Toggled Edicts will have monthly Unity Upkeep which is modified by Empire Sprawl. Each empire has an Edicts Fund which subsidizes Edict Upkeep, reducing the amount you have to pay each month to maintain them.</li>
<li>Unity Ambitions and Campaigns now function like Toggled Edicts and last until cancelled with upkeep rather than costs. Known Issue: Sacrifice Edicts do not show their up-front costs. Or charge them, other than the actual sacrifices, so these two cancel each other out.</li>
<li>Several other systems that used to cost Influence are now paid in Unity.
	<ul>
<li>Reforming government now costs Unity. The cost is based on Empire Size.</li>
<li>Resettling pops that previously cost Influence now costs Unity. Abandoning colonies still costs Influence.</li>
<li>Suppressing or Promoting factions no longer costs Influence. Known Issue: Unity costs for Faction Manipulation are not yet functioning.</li>
<li>Most Megastructures now cost Unity rather than Influence, with the exception of any related to travel (such as Gateways) or that provide living space (such as Habitats and Ring Worlds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since Factions are no longer producing Influence, a small amount of Influence is now generated by your fleet, based on Power Projection - a comparison of your fleet size and Empire Sprawl.</li>
<li>Leaders now cost Unity to hire rather than Energy, and have Unity upkeep.</li>
<li>Planetary Ascension Tiers have been added to the game. After acquiring three Ascension Perks, Unity can be spent to improve the effects generated by a planet’s Designation by 25%. Costs increase with Empire Sprawl and the number of times you have performed this action. As you acquire more Ascension Perks, the maximum Ascension Tier increases, with an extra maximum bonus once all Ascension Perks have been unlocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>To access it you need to opt into the "stellaris_test" branch, found right at the bottom of the Betas list when you go to the Properties of Stellaris on Steam.</p>
<p>Also, starting Monday - January 31 they're doing another Dev Clash series:</p>

<p>You can buy Stellaris from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Get a fresh up close and personal look at the Steam Deck with Hellish Quart</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a really close view on the Steam Deck in action? Hellish Quart developer Kubold recently had a Steam Deck devkit delivered so they took a video.</p>
<p>Can't say I had heard of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1000360/Hellish_Quart/" target="_blank">Hellish Quart</a> until seeing the video either. It's a physics based, realistic, 3D sword duelling game set in the 17th century and you know what? It looks like a huge amount of fun actually! Not only that, it appears to now work just fine with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. The developer mentioned they will be updating the game to have controller glyphs for the moves list, which it will need to get Verified properly and it's something that should benefit all gamepad players.</p>
<p>The video is about 3 minutes long, and it's easily one of the most chilled-out personal looks we've seen yet. Check it out in our embed below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="52v_Rzx-00k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d2ecb53a8e6876e831e156ec29ad265a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/52v_Rzx-00k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What do you think after seeing this? It's getting increasingly difficult to hold back the excitement.</p>

      <title>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is out on Steam and runs well on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get into a new card game? Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel just released on Steam from Konami Digital Entertainment and the great news is that it works out of the box with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> Experimental on Linux.</p>
<p>A good thing too of course, as the more new releases that work right away the better the chances of more people using Linux - and it's always good news for the upcoming Steam Deck too. Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel has already proven to be massively popular, with it being #4 on Steam's top games by player count (a peak count of 164,465 playing!). Konami claim this is the "definitive edition of the competitive card game that has been evolving for over 20 years".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7DbBwNpOkEI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aba080b3bab710b0de2139bf3d98df5c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7DbBwNpOkEI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Keep in mind this game is free to play, supported by in-game purchases for Gems which you then use to buy packs of cards or their own version of a Battle Pass. There are a few ways to earn as you play but these types of games are often skewed a bit more towards pay 2 win if people with more money buy all the cards constantly to build up a powerful deck. However, it is a game of strategy. Powerful cards don't necessarily mean someone will be able to win if their opponent is clever in their tactics. Just something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Performance of playing it on Linux is great, absolutely no issues there. As expected though, as it's pretty simplistic in terms of what it's actually doing. Playing through the tutorial, plus some Solo and online duels and it's all perfectly smooth sailing.</p>
<p>You can play free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449850/YuGiOh_Master_Duel/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>A whole bunch of games just got Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems Valve has now properly started verifying games ahead of the Steam Deck launch, with a bunch of titles now verified ready to play so let's take a look. The list can be seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>The list is expanding, and we expect obviously a great many more to be noted as verified before the Steam Deck begins launching by the end of February.</p>

</ol>
<p>It's a mixture of native Linux games and Windows builds relying on <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Not being on the list doesn't mean they won't run, as Valve does have very specific criteria that games need to hit to be officially verified. It might be a case of text being too small on the screen stopping them, which no doubt mods will come out to help with that on some games that no longer see developer support.</p>
<p>There's a few games that are already placed into the "Playable" category like War Thunder which has too small text and the launcher being a nuisance, RimWorld needing a manual invoking of the on-screen keyboard for some text input, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt having too small text and so on.</p>
<p>Want to check out the newer Steam store Tablet Mode? It will actually show the Deck Verified symbols and on store pages there's a whole new Steam Deck compatibility section that you can bring up like so:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16912117091642672577gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16912117091642672577gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>To do so it's easy enough in Firefox. Simply open a tab with the Steam store and hit CTRL+SHIFT+M. From there you need to add a new device by selecting the dropdown list that will usually say "Responsive" by default. From there hit "Edit list" and set a name of "Steam Deck" (or anything really), set user agent string to "Valve Steam Gamepad" and a resolution of "910 x 568". Then select it after saving, and refresh and you will get the Tablet Mode.</p>
<p>In other news, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1484035893958569984" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that shipping fees are included in Steam Deck purchases which will hopefully settle a few minds about it.</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III gets a short hype-trailer for The Daemon Prince</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is getting real close to the release now, and it's getting exciting for strategy fans to see the conclusion of this epic. Launching officially on February 17, it will be "available as close to launch day as possible on macOS and Linux".</p>
<p>Seems Creative Assembly decided you need to get hyped and remember it's coming, as they've released a short new trailer to show off the rather boringly named (compared with other Warhammer naming that is) Daemon Prince. The trailer may be short but it is pretty great at making me want it now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uebto73ZUFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/178f4d110271e2fb4d1f4ee30d85c2d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uebto73ZUFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>There's also been some hands-on initial previews from a few of "the bigger lot" like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-campaign-preview" target="_blank">RPS</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-warhammer-3-final-preview-hands-on-pc?utm_source=facebook,twitter" target="_blank">IGN</a>. </em></p>
<p>As a reminder: if you do pre-order (or buy in the first week after release) you will get access to an additional free Race Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER III with the Ogre Kingdoms.</p>
<p>We have again today emailed the porting studio Feral Interactive, to see if they care to tell us if the Linux version will support cross-platform multiplayer. Historically, their ports have not, except for Total War: ROME REMASTERED which they worked on all three platforms for (Linux, macOS and Windows). Will update if they reply, as they did reply not last we asked in November.</p>
<p>You can pre-order from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Action-packed &#39;combat-puzzle&#39; roguelite Red Tether is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's actually called ---Red---Tether--&gt; but that would look a bit odd in the headline. A new release from indie dev Sleeper Games, it's a thoroughly unique looking shoot 'em up with pretty fun looking gameplay.</p>
<p>With the help of a tether harpoon, you will take down large space fleets using an indirect combat system. Instead of firing off your phasers, you'll be hoping your harpoon is well placed to help you tear ships apart and throw them around the screen. Or, simply smash your ship into another because why not? Sounds like a blast. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-uMTRZNrWMk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af3ccaf912534876a43bc638d90fef37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-uMTRZNrWMk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience fresh "combat-puzzle" gameplay that requires split-second tactical decisions amid fast paced action.</li>
<li>Learn to counter various fleet elements, including attack ships, support crafts and logistic units.</li>
<li>Fight through 50+ pre-made waves, or face randomly generated fleets in endless mode.</li>
<li>Clash with 16+ massive boss enemies and turn them into screen-filling explosions.</li>
<li>Dodge clearly telegraphed enemy attacks and potentially turn them against your opponents.</li>
<li>Avoid or exploit various hazards like fuel spills, electrified hulls or coolant clouds.</li>
<li>Unlock 6+ player ships that offer distinct playstyles, advantages and challenges.</li>
<li>Improve your craft with 70+ stackable ship and tether upgrades.</li>
<li>Discover 10+ star system zones and the new enemies they throw at you.</li>
<li>Piece together the games lore by finding black boxes among all the ship-debris.</li>
<li>Late game challenge modes.</li>
<li>Basic controller support and assist options.</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE begin the 15-Minute Bug Initiative to make Plasma great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma is a pretty frelling great desktop environment - but couldn't it be better? The KDE team <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/01/18/the-15-minute-bug-initiative/" target="_blank">have begun</a> the previously announced 15-Minute Bug Initiative.</p>
<p>The idea is to clean up issues in Plasma that affect the user experience within the first 15 minutes of booting. Encountering bugs quickly will put people off and gives a bad impression of not just Plasma, but of Linux as a whole. So this is their time to shine, especially with the Steam Deck coming that uses Plasma for the normal desktop mode.</p>
<p>It's up to the KDE team on exactly what they will include in the list, and some may take quite a while to actually solve so they might not fix them all even in the space of a year. What will absolutely get included in the list? Developer Nate Graham outlined these points as a start (but others are considered too of course):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Affects the default setup</li>
<li>100% reproducible</li>
<li>Something basic doesn’t work (e.g. a button doesn’t do anything when clicked)</li>
<li>Something basic looks visually broken (e.g. <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395725" target="_blank">“korners”</a> bug)</li>
<li>Causes you to get locked you out of your system</li>
<li>Causes a full session crash</li>
<li>Requires a reboot or terminal commands to fix</li>
<li>There’s no workaround</li>
<li>It’s a recent regression</li>
<li>The bug report has more than 5 duplicates</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the current list of <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=critical&amp;bug_severity=grave&amp;bug_severity=major&amp;bug_severity=crash&amp;bug_severity=normal&amp;bug_severity=minor&amp;bug_severity=task&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=CONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;known_name=VHI-priority%20Plasma%20bugs&amp;list_id=1948787&amp;order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cbug_severity%2Cbug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&amp;priority=VHI&amp;product=Bluedevil&amp;product=Breeze&amp;product=Discover&amp;product=drkonqi&amp;product=frameworks-kirigami&amp;product=frameworks-plasma&amp;product=frameworks-qqc2-desktop-style&amp;product=kactivitymanagerd&amp;product=kde-gtk-config&amp;product=kdeplasma-addons&amp;product=khelpcenter&amp;product=kinfocenter&amp;product=klipper&amp;product=kmenuedit&amp;product=krunner&amp;product=KScreen&amp;product=kscreenlocker&amp;product=ksmserver&amp;product=ksysguard&amp;product=KSystemLog&amp;product=kwin&amp;product=Plasma%20SDK&amp;product=Plasma%20Vault&amp;product=Plasma%20Workspace%20Wallpapers&amp;product=plasma-integration&amp;product=plasma-nm&amp;product=plasma-pa&amp;product=plasma-simplemenu&amp;product=plasmashell&amp;product=policykit-kde-agent-1&amp;product=Powerdevil&amp;product=print-manager&amp;product=printer-applet&amp;product=pulseaudio-qt&amp;product=systemsettings&amp;product=Touchpad-KCM&amp;product=user-manager&amp;product=xdg-desktop-portal-kde&amp;query_based_on=VHI-priority%20Plasma%20bugs&amp;query_format=advanced" target="_blank">bugs tagged here</a>. There's a few really problematic looking issues there like their application menu Kickoff, which sometimes at random <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=447962" target="_blank">loses the hotkey</a> to open it. A bug I encountered only yesterday and it is thoroughly annoying.</p>

      <title>RetroArch need your feedback on their Open-Hardware planned for 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RetroArch announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/retroarch-announce-the-open-hardware-project-plus-a-new-fantasy-console-core/" target="_blank">back in February 2021</a> their plans for the Open-Hardware project. This was to bring an easy way for you to play your legally owned physical games directly in emulators and they have an update on their plans.</p>
<p>The idea is a sound one. Giving you open source hardware to plug in various cartridges from retro consoles, with great integration with RetroArch directly. You would no longer need to rely on various hard to come by proprietary solutions. In the <a href="https://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-open-hardware-newsletter-user-survey/" target="_blank">new blog post</a> though, plans have changed - and sounds like it's for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4141736961642596745gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4141736961642596745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Instead of it purely being for the DIY market of tinkerers, they're now partnering with a hardware manufacturer for a proper commercial release, which should enable many more people to get it. They made it clear the "free and open DIY route" will still be a thing though for people to make it themselves. As a result, the hardware will be more modular. There will be a base unit that you connect with various addon modules, each of these additional bits supporting different older console hardware. Although the initial release still targets the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>The good news is that it sounds like it's going well, with plans to enter production in mid 2022 for release by the end of the year. That is, unless they also come up against supply chain issues.</p>
<p>RetroArch's team has asked that people sign up to their <a href="https://retroarchopenhardware.com/" target="_blank">Newsletter</a> and fill out a <a href="https://retroarchopenhardware.com/survey.php" target="_blank">Survey</a> so they can get more info from people who are interested.</p>

      <title>One of the most challenging VR rhythm games releases February 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VR rhythm game Groove Gunner from BitCutter Studios Inc will be leaving Early Access on February 10. If you own a VR kit, this is one you need to try. It will make you sweat - probably a lot.</p>
<p>Much like other rhythm games, it's all about speed and accuracy. Instead of cutting through blocks like you do in Beat Saber, you have two coloured guns which you use to shoot and each arm also has a shield that you need to block incoming projectiles with. It's very different to any other rhythm game and easily stands above some other attempts to make a VR game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ymiVSI6718w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c9e2f979036942e7c2ac11a1ee4afde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ymiVSI6718w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Combining together the need for speed, accuracy and some serious hand-eye coordination it will be a true test of your skill. It has some pretty great tunes included too and last month the developer added in features to enable custom tracks  with the in-game custom song browser and editor.</p>
<p>The included music is all from independent artists. With this the developer went for what they say is a "unique approach", so rather than going with traditional licensing models the result you get is a thoroughly strange (but great) mix between pop and electronic music interspersed with metal, hip hop, rock, and more.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976930/Groove_Gunner/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>dbrand are cooking up something big for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not entirely clear what dbrand has planned, however their team are clearly cooking up something with a teaser being posted on Twitter.</p>
<p>Who are dbrand? They're a company that specialises in creating custom skins, cases, screen protectors and plenty more for various hardware from phones to consoles and stuff in between - they even make face masks. They're really popular so it's not surprising to see plenty of excitement around their plans for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The official account simply <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1483586665281208324" target="_blank">said</a> "making things" and included this image:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5099562801642593572gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5099562801642593572gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That shot sure looks shiny. It is of course a render and not the real thing but it gives us a small glimpse into what they could be planning with a full custom shell and joysticks. One thing is for sure - I'm going to want a little extra protection on mine, whenever I'm able to get one.</p>
<p>In reply to someone asking if they're making skins, they replied "dream bigger".</p>
<p>What do you expect / hope to see them do for the Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.0 is officially out now bringing better compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just over a year since the last major version bump, Alexandre Julliard has announced the final <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.0" target="_blank">release of Wine 7.0</a>. This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows applications and games on Linux, macOS and other systems.</p>
<p>For those who have been running the biweekly development releases, the feature list of what has changed won't be new. As the main releases are just all the work in the development releases, plus a little extra time spent on bug fixing during the Release Candidate stage.</p>
<p>Just some of what's new since Wine 6.0 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most modules converted to PE format. They're nearly finished with this, with plans to convert the rest after 7.0.</li>
<li>Better theming support, with a bundled theme for a more modern look.</li>
<li>Vastly improved HID stack and joystick support.</li>
<li>New WoW64 architecture. The team say once the remaining modules are converted to PE, "this will make it possible to run 32-bit applications without installing 32-bit Unix libraries".</li>
<li>Lots more work on Direct3D support with many more Direct3D 10 and 11 features implemented.</li>
<li>Media Foundation support is more complete.</li>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 7.0.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't know when Steam Play Proton will see an update. Last we saw, it was <em>planned</em> at some point.</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive updated, more tweaking for Steam Deck + Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues to tweak more of their games ahead of the Steam Deck release in February and their focus now appears to be on CS:GO with a fresh update out.</p>
<p>A few more Steam Input improvements came for controllers, with their newer "FlickStick" mode enabled in the game options instead of the Steam Input Configurator and there's also refinements to the behaviour. For those not aware, FlickStick <a href="http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/blog:good-gyro-controls-part-2:the-flick-stick" target="_blank">created by Jibb Smart</a> is in essence a quick way to turn to face any direction in a game, allowing you to be more accurate and speedy with gamepad sticks. Valve added support for it to Steam Input directly in 2021, now it has better native support in CS:GO.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5511558221642520051gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5511558221642520051gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the Vulkan support, it was originally introduced in experimental form in CS:GO on December 14 - 2021, and it's not clear what updates have been done in the January 17 - 2022 update, as the team simply mentioned again that CS:GO now has Vulkan API support which you can enable by adding "-vulkan" as a launch option for the game on Steam. Presumably this will be the default for the Steam Deck to ensure smooth performance. This is using the <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a> project.</p>
<p>Additionally the update also notes these fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Hammer crash on startup when not logged into Steam.</li>
<li>Fixed input delay after closing radial menu.</li>
<li>Tooltips to help clarify console controller settings.</li>
<li>Various fixes to sliders.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can play CS:GO free on Linux from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Penguin Heist game hits 25,000 sales with 5% on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Greatest Penguin Heist of All Time developers That Fish / That Other Fish have announced their Early Access game seems to be doing reasonably well. Released back in July 2021, it's recently hit over 25,000 sales.</p>
<p>"The Greatest Penguin Heist of All Time is the one and only 4 player CO-OP physics-based heist game featuring a bunch of kleptomanic penguins. You'll experience a blend of physics-based platforming with stealth, strategy, and action. You have full freedom to achieve the missions in your own way."</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/s5qhab/we_released_our_game_on_steam_around_6_months_ago/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>, the developer mentioned "The game released into Early Access 6 months ago, and we've been working hard on making it better and better with the help of the game's community. We are at around 25000 sales at the moment and it's growing steadily, and 5% of those sales are on Linux, probably more since plenty of people dual boot.</p>
<p>Being a Linux user myself, it was pretty obvious to release it for Linux as well, and we're happy that a lot of people have come to enjoy the game."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vcj3-1dnA_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50e8e7c12e527b783b662880e9747d6d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vcj3-1dnA_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Online CO-OP with up to 4 people playing together</li>
<li>11 very different maps/heists</li>
<li>70+ weapons and items</li>
<li>50+ clothes and skins</li>
<li>Heist planner with custom loadouts</li>
<li>Daily challenges</li>
<li>Realistic penguin nooting</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I must admit I am a little surprised, considering my initial attempts to play it were met by a thoroughly unfinished experience that I didn't find particularly fun either. Clearly they're onto something though, given the sales and a Very Positive user rating on Steam. They've had a fair number of big updates since last trying it though, so perhaps it has improved a fair bit.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451480/The_Greatest_Penguin_Heist_of_All_Time/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of wider industry news today. News which completely blows my mind - Microsoft are out to <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/" target="_blank">acquire Activision Blizzard</a>. Pending all the regulatory approvals they need to go through which takes times and can be denied.</p>
<p>This continues the very worrying trend of these mega companies amassing huge resources. Microsoft now control a ridiculous amount of publisher and developer teams, easily helping towards more lock-in with Microsoft services and products. For Microsoft, it makes sense of course, since they can continue dumping titles into Game Pass and get more subscriptions for recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard has been in a lot of hot water lately, which is probably a big understatement. Employees and investors have repeatedly called for the removal of the current CEO, Bobby Kotick. The press release is a bit vague on what will happen with Kotick, as it mentions Kotick "will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard" and then "Once the deal closes, the Activision Blizzard business will report to Phil Spencer, CEO, Microsoft Gaming". So it somewhat makes it sound like Kotick might only be there until the deal is fully done but it's pretty vague. Probably intentionally vague due to the ongoing issues. <strong>Update</strong>: Kotick will remain, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed via email. <strong>Update #2</strong>: They tried to clarify again later that they were speaking generally about the acquisition so it's anyone's guess what will happen with Kotick (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-xbox-activision-blizzard-acquisition-update?utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">IGN</a>).</p>
<p><em>This will be an "all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion" which is so much money I can't even begin to imagine it.</em></p>
<p>Microsoft will then own the likes of Activision, Blizzard and King studios with Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty, Candy Crash and global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. The press release states this will make Microsoft "the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony".</p>
<p>Since Microsoft isn't quite the same as the Microsoft of old, we might end up seeing more Activision Blizzard games come to Steam and so making it even easier to run them on Linux through <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Imagine having Diablo, Starcraft, Overwatch, various newer Call of Duty games and so on being a few clicks away on Steam + Linux.</p>
<p>What do you think to this news? The deal is expected to close in 2023.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>"Trapped in Professor Cheshire's mysterious mansion, players will have to explore and cooperate to get out of the rooms in the allotted time. Each room has its own secrets, puzzles... and story bits on Hildegarde and Professor Cheshire Learn more about Hildegarde's journey at the Cheshire Institute. From the library to the secret room to the dormitory, meet new characters, secrets, challenges, and strange events. Will Hildegarde find a way to escape? And will you?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XRnBg4nwE08"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ddf5647c37a55ee8ec985821286448e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XRnBg4nwE08" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>It is genuinely nice to see more good-looking escape room games coming to Steam. However, hopefully they've taken on some of the feedback from the first game which only had a Mostly Positive user rating. Doesn't sound particularly long either. They will have to do a fair bit to pull people from the likes of Escape Simulator, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/escape-simulator-hits-over-4m-in-gross-sales/" target="_blank">is doing very well</a>.</p>

      <title>We&#39;ll always have Paris is a narrative adventure about loving someone with dementia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hWoZPi9iaZU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19ab26646ed3378c023f39561c83760e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hWoZPi9iaZU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Ys IX: Monstrum Nox gets improvements ready for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ys IX: Monstrum Nox from developers Nihon Falcom, PH3 GmbH, Engine Software and publisher NIS America, Inc. has released an update to get the game ready for the Steam Deck. There's no native port here though, it continues to rely on the <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Released on Steam back in July 2021, the latest update version 1.1.2 brings with it local co-op and some improvements to the aspect ratio support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SNgDIFRG7S8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f1228857e78e1d1c535a76f070e3c0e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SNgDIFRG7S8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Specifically for the Steam Deck, it brings in 16:10 Aspect Ratio Support. The developer said: "Previous versions of Ys IX used letterboxing for any resolution aspect ratio narrower than 16:9. In this version, all 3D scenes render at full resolution for aspect ratios such as 16:10 (even down to 4:3). 2D elements such as the menu or map screens will still be letterboxed as, just like for ultrawide, the effort to redesign all of these to be aspect-ratio-independent is prohibitive."</p>
<p>It won't just benefit the Steam Deck of course but it is obviously the biggest reason to do so right now. They also included this fancy shot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2161347951642505767gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2161347951642505767gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/ys-ix-monstrum-nox?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1351630/Ys_IX_Monstrum_Nox/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve continues tweaking their new Store Hubs for tags</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Valve's latest store updates experiment that's ongoing, they gave a new look to Store Hubs for all the various tags and they just release an update with plenty of tweaks.</p>
<p>Steam Labs Experiment 13 that was announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/35143931/view/3030352531883893693" target="_blank">back in December</a> gave the same refresh that other parts of Steam had seen, to upgrade the browsing experience with more information and to better make use of all the data they have. More personalization, items from your wishlist and more. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamLabs/announcements/detail/3109173124154011198" target="_blank">new update</a> has these tweaks:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simplified the area above the item browser list view</li>
<li>Moved events and coming soon titles below the item browser list view</li>
<li>Updated the SPECIALS section with better logic for determining what titles to display, now called the CURRENT SPECIALS section. This section takes popularity of discounts into account, while the previous version merely displayed the deepest discounts.</li>
<li>Improved tag browsing: Refined the item browser by merging all of the subgenres into one list for easier exploration, plus moving a few features and themes around</li>
<li>Fixed the main carousel to filter out items based on store search preferences (hide ignored items, content types, etc.)</li>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 9: Ancient Archaeology</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-8-shovelware-with-a-penguin/" target="_blank">Part 8: Shovelware with a Penguin</a></strong></p>
<p>After the demise of Loki Software, one of their former employees found himself forced to work behind a cash register for a living. Desperate to get back to porting games, he found the email address of an artist working for the Croatian developer Croteam, creators of the game <em>Serious Sam</em>. Croteam agreed to let him attempt to create a port of the game to Linux, the first of many games to come to the platform thanks to the work of Ryan “icculus” Gordon.</p>
<p>The port of <em>Serious Sam </em>though would in the end never leave the beta stage. Croteam later released the source code to the game in 2016, with Ryan himself returning to craft his own source port, but his original effort languished for years with a number of unfortunate bugs. One of these left the game unbeatable as it prevented the player from inflicting any damage to the final boss. Unbeatable that is with the standard version of the game.</p>
<p>Our friends at Global Star Software released <em>Serious Sam: Limited Edition</em> in 2002, a bizarre budget retail variant of <em>Serious Sam: The First Encounter</em> that only features seven out of the fifteen levels. It also happens to be the only version of the game that I possess on CD-ROM. I initially dismissed the idea of playing <em>Serious Sam</em> as I thought it would be too much for the hardware, but the jewel case insists that the Rage 128 Pro is compatible.</p>
<p><em>Serious Sam</em> is indeed playable, although it does seem to be held back by my Pentium III 500 Katmai, as changing the graphical settings alone does not have any great impact on performance. To its credit, the Serious Engine scales well on weaker hardware, remaining fluid even as the frame rate sometimes slowed to a bullet time like crawl. The one exception to this is with reflective surfaces, which on Linux stalled the game completely as long as they were in view.</p>
<p>Installation was also far from simple. Ryan released a number of time limited installers you have to use in sequence to get the game to work, starting with beta1a and finishing with beta3. I also had to override the libvorbis.so and libvorbisfile.so libraries in the Bin directory with those from my system in order to have the game launch with working sound and music. From there I increased the audio frequency to 44 kHz and turned off “Detail textures” in the game options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4988389881637697171gol6.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4988389881637697171gol6.jpeg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17705477221637626270gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17705477221637626270gol6.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Beyond that the port works outside of the occasional minor graphical glitch, softlock, or segmentation fault, made all the more forgivable by the fact that the Windows version at one point forced me to power cycle the computer. Linux also holds an advantage by not requiring the CD-ROM to be inserted into the drive in order to play, something demanded even when you select the full installation option on Windows.</p>
<p><em>Serious Sam: Limited Edition</em> ends upon completing the Dunes level right as you are entering Memphis, kicking you to the High Score table on Windows but just looping the Dunes level again when using the Linux binaries. An interesting cleave point regardless, as it is about there that <em>Serious Sam</em> starts to lose my interest. I really do appreciate the game’s Ancient Egyptian atmosphere, as well as the creative monster designs and world building provided by NETRISCA.</p>
<p>Before long though <em>Serious Sam</em> becomes flanderized. By at least the Oasis level the gunplay narrows to the “horde” shooter formula of holding down the fire button while circle strafing and backstepping, all while opposing a ludicrous amount of enemies, usually in locked arenas or featureless open spaces. With <em>Serious Sam</em> I can accept that not liking that paradigm is missing the point of the game, but it is a far cry from the classic shooters that it claims to imitate.</p>
<p>In fairness <em>Serious Sam: The Second Encounter</em> does alleviate this somewhat by adding more variety and a number quality of life improvements, even if it does double down on the absurdity. It also had a Linux beta crafted by Ryan but the same bugs that leave the first game unbeatable leave the second close to unplayable. At least the source port does now resolve both these issues assuming that you can get it to build.</p>
<p>Going back a step to Global Star Software's <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> compilation, one of the titles included there dredged up fond memories of a game I spent way too much time with back when I was way too young to have been playing it. It is one of the earliest games made for Linux, with it being the same age that I am, and while the game itself may be wicked, it still deserves a chance to be welcomed back into the fold.</p>

      <title>Collabora pulls in Jason Ekstrand to work on Linux graphics drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jason Ekstrand, a name that many big Linux fans will know, who previously worked at Intel until very recently has announced today the move to open source consulting firm Collabora. Writing in <a href="https://www.jlekstrand.net/jason/blog/2022/01/hello-collabora/" target="_blank">a blog post</a>, Ekstrand goes through some fun background on the decision to move and how it happened.</p>
<p>Ekstrand has worked on a lot of different parts of Mesa, the set of open source graphics drivers that powers AMD GPUs, Intel, ARM and more. Thankfully, Mesa work will continue with the new posting at Collabora and with plenty of freedom to choose the work too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what did Collabora finally offer me that no one else has? Total autonomy. In my new role at Collabora, my mandate consists of two things: invest in and mentor the Collabora 3D graphics team and invest in upstream Linux and open-source graphics however I see fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like an offer you can't refuse…</p>
<p>Having someone with so much knowledge of open source graphics drivers continue doing it - awesome. Ekstrand continues to mention their work will likely jump between a bit of everything like Panfrost (ARM Mali GPUs), Ray Tracing for RADV (AMD Vulkan driver), OpenCL upgrades and the list goes on. Collabora is also a Khronos Group member (who oversee OpenGL, Vulkan and many other standards) and so they will continue to be involved there directly too.</p>

      <title>Love cracking locks? Check out Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking is a wonderful little idea to bring together many different ways to crack locks from various styles in video games. Perhaps one of the greatest foes in gaming - the lock. Now it's time to beat it in many different forms.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z2jgnYm8RHY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a7a8b9559c86a514e6ab514f0259902.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z2jgnYm8RHY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge yourself against locks from dozens of game worlds</li>
<li>Compare your skills with other players via Steam leaderboards</li>
<li>Unlock the complete set of Steam achievements for mastering all the minigames</li>
<li>Beat "The Door," a fiendish set of ever-changing locks from every exhibit in the Museum</li>
<li>Read analysis on each minigame from a professional game designer</li>
<li>Go deeper into the design of each game with our archived source code, and even implement them yourself, should you catch the lockpicking bug!</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing about the game, designer Johnnemann Nordhagen mentioned: "As a game designer, you often find yourself doing research on how other games do things - it's a good way to get ideas, see what works and what doesn't, and build an understanding of the space you're solving problems in. Usually this research involves buying a lot of games and playing until you get to the part you want to see, if you can remember the games that have it!</p>
<p>How nice it would be, I thought, if someone collected all the reference for particular ways of doing things in one place. Thus was born the Museum of Mechanics, and the first entry: Lockpicking. Many genres and types of games include lockpicking minigames, so I thought I would do an exploration of a broad swathe of them and gather them together in a single place. This is the result. I hope you'll join me in exploring the different ways this has been done through the history of games."</p>
<p>Now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1735110/Museum_of_Mechanics_Lockpicking/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>. You can also try out an older version on <a href="https://dimbulbgames.itch.io/museum-of-mechanics-lockpicking" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>After 12 years development, business sim GearCity is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Built with FOSS tooling, GearCity is a complex and in-depth business simulator where you run your own car company. Developed by Visual Entertainment And Technologies, which is a solo outfit of just Eric Jones who outsourced some parts to contractors for artwork, translations, music and a few other bits.</p>
<p>"GearCity is a realistic historically focused economic simulation of the global automobile industry. Unlike tycoon games, GearCity has not been simplified. It is a complex, realistic, in-depth management sim that will take several hours to grasp and hundreds of hours to master. Thousands of players across the globe and industry professionals from automotive engineers to economics professors have praised the game’s intricate details."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wrtwzcOahV0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/31765b9124ddc43a4b1f10357c6cfa1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wrtwzcOahV0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their email to us, the developer mentioned how it was built and some extra plans for it: "The game is written entirely on top of FOSS libraries, with Ogre3D being the main client driver and SQLite being the backbone of the back-end. The game is completely native. No compatibility layers or JIT compiling are required to run it. I build the Linux ports in Slackware (32-bit build) and Xubuntu (64-bit build). The entire development, including for non-Linux operating systems, takes place in virtual box on top of a Mageia host.</p>
<p>If our future development as a service crowdfunding effort is successful, there is a possibility that I will port the game to ARM-Linux, including Pi 4 and Pine64 systems."</p>
<p>You can buy GearCity on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285110/GearCity/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Very Positive rating from close to 1,000 user reviews so it seems players do enjoy this one. One user review in particular gave me a chuckle mentioning it's "the holy grail of spreadsheet games".</p>
<p>Up next, the developer plans to develop and release a game called AeroMogul, which will be an airline business simulator.</p>

      <title>GOG finally update their store browsing with new filters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game store <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> has finally updated the browsing experience for those of you who prefer getting your games there.</p>
<p>When you go to search for a game now, much like Steam, there's plenty of new options to help sort through masses of games. It was a needed refresh too, since GOG has grown to have over 5,500 titles available across different platforms. When you go to the store pages you will now be able to filter across price range, genres, release date range, and a newly introduced tags system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061239901642429576gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061239901642429576gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>One bit that is now missing however, are the platform icons to see what supports Linux, macOS or just Windows. You now need to use the platform filters, which you can scroll down for on the left panel or go to individual game pages to see. It's a bit of a backwards step for an otherwise great upgrade for searching through GOG.</p>
<p>It's about time really, and perhaps it will help more people find what they want, after it was recently announced that owners CD Projekt <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">have been losing money</a> on <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu plans to go open source and support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Most emulators nowadays have their source code nicely open, and the vast majority of them fully support Linux too but Cemu has been a bit of a holdout. Not for long though.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://wiki.cemu.info/wiki/Roadmap" target="_blank">official roadmap</a>, which many people emailed in excitedly, they put up their plans and who can blame people for being excited on this? Scrolling down a bit, a Linux port is clearly mentioned. It has been an "ongoing side-project" already but quite slow as it was low-priority and it depended on other things being done. The good news is that they say it's about "70%" of the way there already. Having Linux support of course will also be great for the Steam Deck, since it comes with SteamOS 3 (based on Arch Linux).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18806629041642427622gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18806629041642427622gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Just as exciting is the plan for Cemu to go open source! This is planned to happen in 2022 and going open source was "originally promised". No exact ETA on when they plan to do it, as they will also be restructuring the source code. They've been continuing to rewrite various parts of the C code into much newer C++20/23. They also plan to move from Visual Studio to cmake, which is another step towards supporting more operating systems.</p>
<p>So they have a lot of work ahead but it will be worth it. Having it properly open source will ensure it's preservation, just like what it does for old hardware like the Wii U.</p>

      <title>Plasma 5.24 Beta goes live with protection to stop Discover removing Plasma</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest release of the KDE Plasma desktop is close with the Plasma 5.24 Beta going live now with plenty of new features and fixes for this customizable environment. A full release is planned for February 8.</p>
<p>Along with a lot of bug fixes, there's plenty of quality of life fixes across the whole desktop. The Breeze theme for example, will now properly respect your choice of accent colours for Folders, the Breeze colour scheme is now called "Breeze Classic" to distinguish from Breeze Light and Breeze Dark and more. The notification system also saw some updates. so that important notifications have a small orange strip to bring more attention to them, notifications about video files now display a thumbnail in the notification and when sending or receiving files via Bluetooth, a system notification is now always shown.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11897561541642423089gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11897561541642423089gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Plenty more modernizations were done across the desktop too like the "Plasma Pass" password manager seeing an updated design, Battery and Brightness now turns into just Brightness controls on computers with no batteries, Media Player correctly shows "nothing playing" when the last playing app is closed and you can easily set your background in the context menu of any image.</p>
<p>For fans of the software installer / updater Discover, you'll be pleased to know this release also includes the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/kde-discover-prevents-breaking-your-linux-system/" target="_blank">recently talked about</a> upgrades to prevent users unintentionally removing their desktop environment too.</p>
<p>Some bigger updates also came towards improving Wayland like support for more than 8-bit colours, DRM Leasing support added for VR headsets, the "Minimize All Windows" widget now works with Wayland, the Spectacle screenshot tool now has access to the "Active Window" mode on Wayland and there's more.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental pulls in newer DXVK to help God of War on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A small update landed last night for Proton Experimental with a main aim of helping the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/god-of-war-on-linux-with-proton/" target="_blank">recent God of War release</a>, which has been running quite nicely already. ICYMI: there was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/proton-experimental-fixes-up-sea-of-thieves-voice-chat/" target="_blank">another update</a> to Proton Experimental recently that solved a number of problems like Sea of Thieves voice chat.</p>
<p>The only change we know of for the January 14 release of Proton Experimental is an update to the DXVK version used, which added in some new options that are turned on by default in DXVK's configuration to help the performance in God of War even more. On top of that, it also makes it easier to use NVIDIA DLSS as it disabled DXVK's NVAPI hack for God of War. Now all you need to do for God of War is add this launch option to enable DLSS: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 %command%</code></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10412467931642246849gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10412467931642246849gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can buy God of War on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/god-of-war?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>See the Proton Experimental <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a> to see all the current differences to the normal Proton releases. This update is not currently noted in the actual changelog at time of writing.</p>
<p>Need to know how to actually use Proton Experimental? Here's a simple HOWTO (as it's not complicated!). Make sure it's installed by searching for it in your Steam Library, then select it from the Compatibility menu in the Properties section of a game. See our quick video below:</p>

      <title>God of War is now on Steam and runs out of the box on Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that still doesn't quite feel right somehow is seeing the likes of a PlayStation logo on Linux. Anyway, the smash hit God of War is now on Steam and works right away on Linux. You can thank <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> for that.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe the changing face of gaming sometimes. Previously console exclusive games now coming to PC more often. A trend I hope to see continue for years to come. Of course the new release comes with the kinds of things you would expect like enhanced graphics, ultra-wide support, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u9wM2Zdeloc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fef269f80b4f3c1aeba7d0209f1d1562.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u9wM2Zdeloc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter the Norse realm<br/>
His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… and teach his son to do the same.</p>
<p>Grasp a second chance<br/>
Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.</p>
<p>Journey to a dark, elemental world of fearsome creatures<br/>
From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains and caves of pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters and gods.</p>
<p>Engage in visceral, physical combat<br/>
With an over the shoulder camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War™ mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of the God of War series while presenting a vision of conflict that forges new ground in the genre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some really heavy stuttering though with an NVIDIA GPU. As always with more graphically intense games built for Windows and run through Proton, they need time to build up a shader cache. Once that is done, eventually Steam will have it to give out while the game downloads for your machine to sort it ahead of time. So, if you want a smooth experience, it usually pays to wait a week or so. That said, if you want to put up with the stuttering for a bit, don't let us stop you as outside of that, it seems to play quite brilliantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7995574551642189966gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7995574551642189966gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12815339661642189968gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12815339661642189968gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like me, you might find that the lip-syncing voice audio is completely off though. It's possible you can fix that by adding this as a Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code>PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 %command%</code><br/>
<em>In my own testing, that made it match up much better but not always.</em></p>
<p>One <em>possible</em> way to improve day-1 performance in this and other single-player games is to use the community built  <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/protonup-qt-adds-support-for-lutris-flatpak-new-batch-update-feature/" target="_blank">Proton-GE</a>, which you can get easily with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/protonup-qt-adds-support-for-lutris-flatpak-new-batch-update-feature/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>. Proton-GE has DXVK_ASYNC, which can help reduce stutter but is not recommended for multiplayer titles as it can trip up anti-cheat. In my own testing, it made God of War massively smoother. If you choose to try that out it's this launch option: <code class="inline-code">DXVK_ASYNC=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Since I'm not much of a console gamer, even though I do own multiple consoles, I completely missed this and had no idea that Christopher Judge was the voice actor for Kratos so if you'll excuse me I have some fanboying to do.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/god-of-war?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck on track for the end of February</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news, following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/valve-delays-steam-deck-now-starts-shipping-february-2022/" target="_blank">previous delay</a> and even with the pandemic and global shortages Valve has announced that the Steam Deck is still on track to ship by the end of February.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675180/announcements/detail/3122683923029138793" target="_blank">fresh post</a>, Valve said that testing for the Steam Deck Verified program is underway, which we already knew since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/looks-like-portal-2-is-the-first-steam-deck-verified-title/" target="_blank">Portal 2</a> got recently officially verified. It's also currently still the only one.</p>
<p>Testing for developers directly is important of course, which is why Valve continues to send out developers kits. Another wave has been approved, with "hundreds" being shipped out in the last month and Valve say more continue to be approved and thanked developers for their patience.</p>
<p>So it's all good news and hopefully soon actual consumers will have their hands on their first real devices.</p>
<p>Valve also included this shot showing a bunch of them in the KDE Plasma desktop mode:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18012921661642156617gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18012921661642156617gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you missed it, we recently took a look at how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/top-100-steam-games-running-on-linux-january-2022-edition/" target="_blank">Steam Top 100</a> will play on Linux (and so the Steam Deck with SteamOS 3). Valve and developers still have plenty of work ahead to get the device into a sweet spot. It's not just compatibility with native Linux or Windows builds in Proton, it's also dealing with the screen size for text clarity and gamepad support, both of which we hope to see more developers fix up.</p>

      <title>The Anacrusis appears to run on Linux with Proton but some possible caveats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Anacrusis is a brand new release from Stray Bombay, and it's another entry in the swarm-shooter like Left 4 Dead and Back 4 Blood. Running it on Linux is possible too. Interestingly, Stray Bombay was co-founded by former Valve designer Chet Faliszek who worked on the likes of Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead.</p>
<p>"The Anacrusis is a four-player, cooperative first-person shooter set aboard a massive starship stranded at the edge of explored space. Team up with your friends in an infinitely-replayable fight against alien hordes to unlock perks, weapons, and new ways to play that you can share with your team!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B8sHto6X3ng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c7b563ccb8b667ddc4fb0eb733b12c03.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B8sHto6X3ng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To play it on Linux you'll need <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Here's where things get interesting: for my system, it wouldn't run correctly with Proton Experimental, as it would get stuck on a mission loading video and just freeze. However, with Proton-GE which you can get easily with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/protonup-qt-adds-support-for-lutris-flatpak-new-batch-update-feature/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, it worked as it should and allowed me to get into a mission. Your mileage may vary there, as I've already seen others say it works for them with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>For me the bigger problem was firing any of the weapons. A similar issue I experienced in Aliens Fireteam Elite, where it caused a huge amount of unplayable stutter and it just didn't seem to go away. So right now, it makes The Anacrusis unplayable but once again, <em>your</em> mileage may vary, as I've seen a couple others report it works fine. There's probably a problem on my system somewhere that I just can't find - so hopefully for the majority it will work out well. Frustrating but seems specific to Unreal Engine titles and plenty others work just fine for me. I have a ticket up on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5493" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, where hopefully a solution will be found.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: turns out the <em>performance</em> problem there was an issue with the KDE Compositor. Ensuring it's truly off seems to make the game perform just fine. So if you find a similar issue and you're also on KDE, hit ALT+Shift+F12 to toggle it off. You can check if it's on or off in terminal using:</p>
<p><code>qdbus org.kde.KWin /Compositor org.kde.kwin.Compositing.active</code><em>It will say true or false depending if it's on or off.</em></p>

      <title>SuperTux released free on Steam, an open source classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving a nice boost to a classic free and open source game, SuperTux has now been released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1572920/SuperTux/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and it's free to download and play.</p>
<p>"Run and jump through SuperTux, the sidescrolling 2D platformer starring Tux, the Linux mascot. Squish and knock out enemies, collect powerups, and solve platforming puzzles throughout the Icy Island and the Rooted Forest, as Tux tries to save his beloved Penny from her kidnapper, Nolok!"</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Platforming gameplay similar to original Super Mario games, with some unique abilities such as backflipping and dynamic swimming</li>
<li>Lovingly hand-crafted graphics contributed by a variety of artists, alongside engaging and catchy music</li>
<li>Engaging levels designed with casual gameplay, puzzling and speedrunning in mind</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's one weird issue it's come with for Manjaro users, who currently <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1572920/discussions/0/3193615617157290677/?ctp=2#c3193615617159586501" target="_blank">need to remove</a> "appimagelauncher" and then it seems to work after a reboot. Other than that, it seems to have been received well by Steam users with it already getting a Positive rating. If you're after a classic free Mario-like, this is it. Not a complete game though, they still have plenty more to add into it and since it's open source anyone can help.</p>

      <title>Heck Deck is a brilliant fusion of bullet-hell and a card game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get when you cross a twin-stick bullet-hell with a card-game? Heck Deck. It's not a particularly long game but the idea is excellent. It ends up more like a deck-building shooter strategy game, it's thoroughly odd to properly pin it to a genre. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>Time only moves when you move and you directly control a little sort-of wiggly-thing. Cards are you abilities and enemies fire cards. The thing is though, when you run out of cards you need to crash yourself into the cards the enemies fire to get more. It hurts you, but you get a new card to use (except health cards - they don't hurt of course). It's absolutely genius and I love it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tNn4XK2t2pg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc2b8f5fc260de49ecce6f9b6b5f5862.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tNn4XK2t2pg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is a truly unique take on a bullet-hell, as it not only requires reasonably good dexterity to be able to move around and avoid too many hits but also the strategy side of it. You need to try and plan ahead, think about what cards to use or to crash into to collect and then to go on the offensive. This really brings the idea of risk-to-reward ratio to life in such a fun way as you're constantly deciding how and when to hurt yourself to progress.</p>
<p>Adding to the difficulty, you can't just constantly spam cards either. Once you use a card, you get a little cool-down that disappears as you move forcing you to keep moving which is difficult when enemies come along that spit out cards like mad. Only certain cards allow you to actually aim a shot too, there's plenty that need you to position yourself exactly where you're needed leading to more fancy finger work to slip through and around of enemy cards.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>5 different levels with their own music</li>
<li>A cute hand-drawn art style</li>
<li>One unique setting for each level</li>
<li>Dozens of attacks and spells for the player</li>
<li>Over 30 enemies and bosses</li>
<li>A card purchase system via the shop</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://torcado.itch.io/heck-deck" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1606210/Heck_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Buy it, it's great and might even be a new personal favourite.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator hits over $4M in gross sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator has turned into a big success story for indie games and developer Pine Studio, with an announcement about how well it's done.</p>
<p>Releasing on Steam back in October 2021, writing on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/rmy3o2/escape_simulator_passed_4m_in_sales_in_less_than/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> the team noted how it has managed to hit "$4M in gross sales in less than two months of being released on Steam". It just goes to show that with the right know-how, indie developers can still manage to cut through the noise of thousands of games releasing on Steam all the time.</p>
<p>How did they do it? As the Reddit post explains that part of the reason is that they hired a good PR team, and worked to create a good trailer. Plenty of it comes down to clever marketing, although it sounds like it did take a fair bit of time to do, like creating special puzzle rooms for people who covered the game. There was also some cross-promotion with other developers, and a lot of wishlists came from having a demo at some Steam festivals. Overall, it's an interesting little look into what goes on behind the scenes to make a game a success.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio pulls in NVIDIA as a new sponsor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio continues growing, with NVIDIA joining as their latest big sponsor to help this free and open source project continue getting better.</p>
<p>Announced by the official OBS account on <a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1481398401317093378" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, it notes that NVIDIA is a new Diamond sponsor. This means that NVIDIA will be providing at least $50,000 a year to the project. This doesn't mean NVIDIA has any kind of control over OBS and they join the likes of Logitech, Twitch, Facebook and more in helping to fund probably the best way to record and livestream video on Linux.</p>
<p>This also isn't the first time NVIDIA has become a big sponsor of FOSS software, as they also sponsor Blender.</p>
<p>If you missed it, OBS is preparing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/obs-studio-272-enters-beta-with-official-flatpak-support/" target="_blank">brand new release</a>, which amongst other things will bring with it official Flatpak support for the Linux version making it easier than ever to get the official package across many different Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Nice to see more companies appreciate open source.</p>

      <title>Looks like Monster Hunter Rise runs well on Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Hunter Rise has just released on Steam today from Capcom and the good news is - it appears to run very nicely out of the box with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> on Linux. That's another tick in the box for a big AAA title.</p>
<p>Tested with Proton Experimental, the only issue currently encountered is a small intro video not playing. This is a reoccurring issue and will be for the Steam Deck, for titles that use things like Media Foundation. If such things bother you, it worked just fine with Proton GE which you can easily download with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/protonup-qt-adds-support-for-lutris-flatpak-new-batch-update-feature/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>. Over time though, Valve will be re-encoding videos for games where it's an issue so eventually more won't see this issue. Luckily here it's really minor.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kvDsMLEIP0I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a426deb1b95a61a56902e6d03a427c0e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kvDsMLEIP0I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I haven't been able to see any obvious issues, there isn't even much stutter which you would usually see from a brand new release on Linux. Then again, it's not as a graphically intense as certain other big releases, since this was originally developed for the Nintendo Switch so it's really not all that surprising.</p>
<p>Overall, a pretty smooth release to be able to play at release on Linux with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206591221642011417gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206591221642011417gol1.jpg"/></a>Tested on EndeavourOS</em></p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu gets big graphical improvements, Flatpak fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yuzu is another incredibly promising open source project, emulating the Nintendo Switch which is not exactly a small job (not that emulation ever is) and <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-dec-2021/" target="_blank">it's improving</a> at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Some good news for NVIDIA users came, with some major problems now being solved. Recently NVIDIA dropped support for some older cards, and the driver changes towards it introduced issues for Yuzu. The devs explain "The root of the problem in NVIDIA’s drivers seems to be in negation of integer and floating point values, and bitwise conversions of input values." - but thankfully all known issues have been worked around. As it turns out, what they ended up doing fixes it for Intel too and was also an optimization so they're now doing it for all APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17719032671641991367gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17719032671641991367gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Fire Emblem: Three Houses running on Yuzu.</em></p>
<p>Other big upgrades came like a fix to scenes in games where multiple videos were playing, which would cause them to glitch and flicker. More improvements to their Vulkan support came along fixing and making LEGO® CITY UNDERCOVER playable. Plus, Immortals Fenyx Rising now works but for the moment has some graphical issues. Even more Vulkan improvements came along to help both The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 fix up their broken shadows.</p>
<p>A fun addition has also been added to support gamepad hotkeys. Basically, it allows you to set special functions to gamepad buttons like access or exit fullscreen, unlock the framerate, pause/continue emulation, capture a screenshot and so on. This was done to help "handheld PC users, couch players, and anyone not wanting to reach all the way to their keyboard while playing" - so, Steam Deck?</p>
<p>There's tons more but for Linux users especially, we're getting better Flatpak support. There's video decoding crashes fixed and they implemented support for XDP's Inhibit API to help prevent the screen going to sleep in the Flatpak.</p>

      <title>Blending 2D and 3D together, puzzle-platformer Neko Ghost, Jump! is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neko Ghost, Jump! shows you what you can get when you blend together new and old, with this platformer having both a 2D and 3D mixture of gameplay in each level.</p>
<p>This is no gimmick either. Levels are designed around needing both 2D and 3D viewpoints, with some areas only being accessible with one viewpoint. Not only that, you also have physical and ghost forms to switch between to solve puzzles and combat enemies too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4WAc3wShick"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6abd0922c9350691f80237ca7ea11e61.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4WAc3wShick" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Neko Ghost, Jump! will remain in Early Access for around 6 months and the developer notes it will launch with 30+ handcrafted levels, 6 boss fights, and 100+ customization options. During Early Access they wish to add additional content including new biomes, levels, and new game modes such as an "ironcat mode" where you only have 9 lives to play through the whole campaign. </p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>100s of character <strong>customization options</strong></li>
<li><strong>40 levels</strong> divided between 8 biomes</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards </strong>in each level to compete against others if you desire</li>
<li>Challenging <strong>boss fights </strong>in each biome</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> and <strong>Assist</strong> options available</li>
<li><strong>Razer Chroma</strong> RGB-enabled</li>
</ul>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt adds support for Lutris Flatpak, new batch update feature</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt is the fantastic and simple way to download and upgrade the Linux compatibility tools Proton-GE, Luxtorpeda, Boxtron or Roberta for Steam and works with both Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher too.</p>
<p>This allows you to easy get these external tools, and have them added to Steam directly so you can pick them as you preferred compatibility option for running games. Proton-GE can sometimes run games that the official Proton can not, Luxtorpeda gives you access to lots of native Linux game engines (like OpenMW for Morrowind), Boxtron for native DOSBox and Roberta for ScummVM. Add to that the ability to easily add newer Wine to Lutris and Heroic and Linux gaming looks easier than ever.</p>
<p>The latest release version 2.5.0 adds these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a "batch update" feature for Proton</li>
<li>Support Lutris Flatpak</li>
<li>Custom install directory GUI</li>
<li>Various bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Using it is so ridiculously simple, I love it. Download it, run it, click a few buttons - done. It really doesn't get better than this.</p>

      <title>PS2 emulator PCSX2 adds in Vulkan API support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>How about some better performance for emulating the PlayStation 2? That's what you're going to get with Vulkan support now hooked up nicely in PCSX2.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/PCSX2/status/1479897098959179776" target="_blank">Twitter</a> the official account said: "A lot of people were asking for a Vulkan renderer and courtesy of Stenzek (Duckstation) it is finally here! It performs better than OpenGL in a lot of cases on similar blending levels so it should make a couple of harder to run games much easier to play! Thanks Sten!". They also included this screenshot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2169397661641983398gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2169397661641983398gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The work done by Connor 'stenzek' McLaughlin (known for the likes of the DuckStation PS1 emulator) can be seen in the merged <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/5224" target="_blank">Pull Request</a> on GitHub. Speed and future-proofing are the obvious reasons for doing it, noting that it's much faster for both AMD and NVIDIA. Since the code is merged already, you can try it out in their development builds.</p>
<p>Nice to see more emulators keep getting better, they're really important for preservation.</p>

      <title>Spring RTS v106.0 released with OpenGL 4 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first major upgrade to <a href="https://springrts.com/" target="_blank">Spring RTS</a> in years is here with <a href="https://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=45525" target="_blank">version 106.0</a>, which has some major architectural changes to the popular game engine. For those who need something of a refresher: Spring RTS starting off life as TASpring to bring the classic Total Annihilation into 3D. It later expanded into a more generic RTS game engine, that has spawned a big community and multiple different games.</p>
<p>Seems this release took a while, as there were differing opinions on where to take Spring RTS next. They needed to do something though, as Spring was just falling behind on everything so thankfully one developer decided to tag a new release with all the previous development changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10419746671641981736gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10419746671641981736gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Zero-K, a Spring-based RTS</em></p>
<p>It's here now and brings with it modern OpenGL 4! Which they said "this should allow better performance on newer hardware". However, most games made would need to be upgraded to work with this new version, as "this breaks most lua opengl code and requires a lot of work for game developers to rewrite it" - so it may be some time before seeing anything use this new Spring version.</p>
<p>The full changelog can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/spring/spring/blob/develop/doc/changelog.txt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You don't actually <em>need</em> to upgrade, as SpringLobby (their main way to play), supports multiple engine versions and games meaning you can continue enjoying whatever Spring based game you usually play.</p>
<p>One promising upcoming game using the Spring RTS engine, although modified quite a lot, is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/beyond-all-reason-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-truly-massive-rts/" target="_blank">Beyond All Reason</a>. At this point, BAR is actually more of an advanced fork that continues progressing further and it won't be surprising if more developers opt to use that instead.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire testing Steam Input ready for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slay the Spire, one of the games that helped to really push the popularity of deck-builders is back with a fresh Beta build, this time getting ready for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Bringing support for Steam Input, this should hopefully give Slay the Spire better gamepad support overall, not just for the Steam Deck but that's of course the biggest reason to do it right now. The update also additionally adds Finnish language support, and updates for other localizations. There's also a removal of "excessive" display config loading and an update for log4j to prevent any future security problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10447972981641979187gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10447972981641979187gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Testing it out today, the gamepad support feels pretty good - great actually. Slay the Spire is a type of game that works really nicely with a gamepad in hand. Everything feels smooth with an Xbox controller at least, easy to kick back and play.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to playing Slay the Spire on Deck?</p>
<p>Slay the Spire is available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/slay-the-spire?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> (big sale until Friday, January 14) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Looks like Portal 2 is the first Steam Deck Verified title</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we come closer to the February launch date of the Steam Deck, it appears Valve are now starting to actually go through and tick titles for their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/valve-launches-deck-verified-to-show-off-what-games-will-work-well-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Deck Verified</a> program.</p>
<p>Reports coming in that were noticed thanks to updates on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/620/history/?changeid=13633175" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, showing that Portal 2 has been through verification. It's not exactly surprising, since it's Valve's own title and Portal 2 has long worked nicely on Linux with their native port. That, and it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/portal-2-from-valve-gets-a-big-update-with-vulkan-support-from-dxvk/" target="_blank">recently upgraded</a> to use DXVK-Native, to give it Vulkan support too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3113882381641978301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3113882381641978301gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We expect plenty more news on titles being Deck Verified over the rest of this month and next, considering how close we're getting to the first batch of customers being invited to actually purchase a unit. The question remains though: exactly how many will actually stick with their reservation? It's likely plenty won't due to various reasons.</p>
<p>In other Steam Deck news, it appears to be quite a sturdy device, as developer Rami Ismail found out noting on <a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1481137667228286980" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "Happy to report that the Steam Deck can survive a drop from countertop height" and as an amusing follow-up asking about "How's that heart rate though haha", Ismail replied "didn't measure but I guess higher than the resolution of the screen". I can't imagine how bad I will feel the first time mine gets dropped, whenever I manage to get one that is.</p>
<p>What games are you really hoping to see updates to make them work well on the Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>Humble Bundle decides you need another launcher for parts of Humble Choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Humble Bundle has <a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2022/01/11/humble-choice-is-leveling-up/" target="_blank">announced</a> changes are coming in February for Humble Choice, so let’s go over what they’re going to be doing.</p>
<p>First up, they’re moving back towards how it started with Humble Monthly. There’s only going to be one single tier at $11.99 / £8.99 / €9.99 - with regional pricing and more regions supported, except if you’re on the Classic plan you continue to be billed in USD. The amount of games will fluctuate, and hopefully mean they will be better and you will get access to all of them.</p>
<p>Humble said: “Our focus is to bring you maximum bang for your buck through an expertly curated mix of awesome games. The exact number of games might vary each month, but no matter what our scouts choose, our mission is to always bring you a ton of value that’s well worth the price of admission. And as always, you can skip a month whenever you want or cancel anytime.”</p>
<p>Next up, they’ve decided you need <em>another</em> launcher with the Humble app, which will only be supported on Windows. This will be required for the new, additional, Humble Games Collection. This will contain a “growing” list of curated games. On top of that the Humble Trove is being renamed to the Humble Vault, which they say will remain “DRM-free” but it will also require the Humble app.</p>
<p>If you pause (now called Skip) or cancel, you lose access to the Humble Games Collection and the Vault.</p>
<p>Humble Store discounts are also changing. It’s no longer a set 10% or 20%. Instead, it’s based on how long you keep going.</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 months: 10%</li>
<li>3-5 months: 15%</li>
<li>6-11 months: 17%</li>
<li>12+ months: 20%</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s clearly Humble Bundle grasping at straws to try and make their business work, as clearly a lot of people were pausing (skipping) months. Reducing the store discount, and taking away parts of it if you do that, they’re of course hoping more people keep it up.</p>
<p>Having more in an app does make some sense, even if I groan at yet another app, as it will remind people more often about what they offer. For Linux users though, having it as Windows-only will likely mean no more Linux builds for the Trove / Vault for example, so a step backwards there, but we’re still a small market they don’t exactly need to care much about.</p>
<p>Once the app is out, we’ll take a look and see if it can be made to run with Wine or set as a launcher in Steam to run with Proton.</p>
<p>The changes come into effect on February 1. Humble have said these changes do not affect the rest of the store or bundles they will do.</p>
<p>What do you think about the changes?</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 510.39.01 Beta driver out for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After silently launching the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/nvidia-releases-a-12gb-geforce-rtx-3080/" target="_blank">RTX 3080 12GB</a>, NVIDIA has also today put out a brand new Beta driver for Linux with <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/184927/en-uk" target="_blank">version 510.39.01</a> now available.</p>
<p>The interesting part is, the changelog mentions quite a number of things that were added in <em>previous</em> driver releases like support for the GBM API. There's also mentions of extensions that were added in previous stable releases too. It's likely that this will be their new "Production Branch" driver that has pulled over lots of changes from their "New Feature Branch". Confused? NVIDIA explain it like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Production Branch</strong> Production Branch drivers provide ISV certification and optimal stability and performance for Unix customers. This driver is most commonly deployed at enterprises, providing support for the sustained bug fix and security updates commonly required.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New Feature Branch</strong> New Feature Branch drivers provide early adopters and bleeding edge developers access to the latest driver features before they are integrated into the Production Branches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some extensions have jumped over in 510.39.01 from their other <em>standalone</em> Vulkan Beta Drivers though, and some are newly supported like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>VK_EXT_depth_clip_control</li>
<li>VK_EXT_border_color_swizzle</li>
<li>VK_EXT_image_view_min_lod</li>
<li>VK_KHR_shader_integer_dot_product</li>
<li>VK_EXT_primitive_topology_list_restart</li>
<li>VK_EXT_load_store_op_none</li>
<li>VK_KHR_maintenance4</li>
<li>VK_KHR_format_feature_flags2</li>
<li>VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering</li>
</ul>
<p>With Dynamic Rendering (VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering) being one of the major additions, something that The Khronos Group <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/the-khronos-group-officially-announces-the-dynamic-rendering-extension-for-vulkan/" target="_blank">announced in late 2021</a> that many developers seemed excited about. This release newly brings AV1 decode support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver, and brings on an optimization for the Vulkan fullscreen presentation path for X11 and direct-to-display swapchains. On top of that they've added a GUI control for setting Image Sharpening values in the app profiles page of the nvidia-settings control panel.</p>
<p>Some of the bug fixes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several issues which caused the supported-gpus.json file to contain incorrect product information.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to report inaccurate ECC error counts, and completely prevented the reporting of aggregate ECC error counts. ECC error counts reported by nvidia-smi were not affected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Vulkan applications to hang when the __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS environment variable was set to enable threaded optimizations in the NVIDIA driver.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where calls to vkWaitForPresentKHR would fail with VK_TIMEOUT on Maxwell and Pascal GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan compiler where 64-bit atomics were partially broken.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where VK_NULL_HANDLE was not properly handled as input to VkRenderingFragmentShadingRateAttachmentInfoKHR.imageView.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where the SPIR-V Centroid interpolation decoration was not ignored when used in conjunction with FragCoord.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where unreferenced descriptor bindings were sometimes not ignored properly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where vkCmdBindDescriptorSets would not properly handle pDynamicOffsets for compute pipelines.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused OpenGL and Vulkan applications to generate excessive traffic over dbus while attempting to communicate with nvidia-powerd, even though nvidia-powerd was not running.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver where some Ray Tracing shaders would timeout, resulting in device loss.</li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA releases a 12GB GeForce RTX 3080</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you with money to burn who want a new GPU, perhaps the latest from NVIDIA will catch your eye? They've introduced a new model of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080-3080ti/" target="_blank">GeForce RTX 3080</a>. It's a small but noticeable upgrade to the original, and only available to a select few partners right now</p>
<p>The bump not only ups the memory from 10GB to 12GB but also goes from 8704 to 8960 CUDA Cores, and you're also getting a memory bus jump from 320-bit to 384-bit. You're going to need just a little bit more power for it too, as NVIDIA say it needs 350 watts compared with the 320 on the 10GB model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17815613031641911354gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17815613031641911354gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While it's nice to see new models - is anyone even going to be able to buy one? Even if you can, will it be a reasonable price? Probably a big <strong>no</strong> to both. You also wouldn't really know it exists, since NVIDIA for some reason decided to keep this release on the quiet side. It's sad to see yet another ridiculously expensive high-end model being made, when there's such a shortage everywhere on all models.</p>
<p>I'm still rocking a RTX 2080 Ti which is thankfully rather powerful so I don't need to upgrade the main GamingOnLinux machine GPU for some time to come.</p>

      <title>DXVK 1.9.3 is out supporting DLSS, D3D9 improvements and more </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK, the Vulkan-based implementation of D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 for Wine / Proton has <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.9.3" target="_blank">version 1.9.3 out now</a>. This is what's used in <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, to help get Windows games running nicely on Linux. It's a bit of an uphill battle to get so many tens of thousands of games to work nicely, but DXVK shows just how powerful and flexible Vulkan is as an API.</p>
<p>This release brings support for NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) for supported games, when used along with <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi" target="_blank">dxvk-nvapi</a>. There's also a bunch of optimizations and accuracy improvements for D3D9 that should help fix games like Red Orchestra 2, Dark Souls 2 (original version), Dog Fight 1942, Bayonetta, Rayman Origins, Guilty Gear Xrd and Richard Burns Rally.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17666662851641906102gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17666662851641906102gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Deep Rock Galactic on Linux with DXVK (Proton)</em></p>
<p>Other improvements include a fix for a "DXGI issue which would sometimes cause games to fail to enter fullscreen mode on some displays that do not support low rates across all resolutions" and improvements for Black Mesa, Crysis 3 Remastered, Euro Truck Simulator, Injustice Gods Among Us, Rocksmith 2014, Spliter Cell: Chaos Theory, Sim City 2013 and The Guild 3.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As a reminder: you can upgrade the version of DXVK used in Proton, without waiting on a new release. To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of DXVK 1.9.3. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. Do so at your own risk but it's usually harmless. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Buck Up And Drive! is a retro-racing delight now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buck Up And Drive! is a fusion of classic retro endless racing with a few fun twists, like 1v1 car fighting mode. Previously only available via itch.io, it's screeched over to Steam now too.</p>
<p>Since we last wrote about it in the Summer of 2021, it's added a bunch of new content for the full release too and it's looking like it's quite amusing. I grew up with racers like this on the Amiga, so it speaks to me quite personally. The developer is quite funny about it too, saying "There is time to explain, I just don't wanna.". Not really selling us on it but the trailer below speaks enough for itself I think.</p>

      <title>DOOMED: Demons of the Nether turns Minecraft into modern DOOM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do Minecraft and modern DOOM have in common? Not a lot but a modder decided to merge them together to create DOOMED: Demons of the Nether and it's pretty darn good.</p>
<p>Giving you a single-player campaign, this free to download mod is inspired by the modern DOOM games borrowing plenty of design elements. Technically, in Minecraft land, it's an adventure map pack but it really does change the game. Take a look at just how impressive it is:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="10W482TEeCQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52a282bd60a97bdbfbf8765f3060c53b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/10W482TEeCQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Installation is easy enough too and I've tested it working nicely on Linux.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a fresh install of Minecraft 1.16.13, <a href="https://sibogy.gumroad.com/l/DOOMED-mc" target="_blank">download the pack</a> and then simply extract the contents into your Minecraft saves folder usually found in <code class="inline-code">~/.minecraft/saves/</code>. That's it, as it comes with everything needed.</p>
<p>Once done, load Minecraft up and select it from the Singleplayer menu and it will guide you through a few settings you might need to tweak to make it look as intended. Absolutely brilliant.</p>

      <title>Survival game Vintage Story gets another huge upgrade with improved combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story continues to impress with not just the rate they can churn out updates, but also how much they manage to stuff into each of them. The "Homesteading part 2 &amp; Combat update" is out now, bringing some pretty fancy new features and so if you've been on the fence about it, perhaps it's time to try it out if you're after a different open-world survival experience. The price will also slightly increase soon.</p>
<p>For this update you can expect to see a server-wide auction house (multiplayer only), new storage options, fruit trees, 34 new types of mushrooms, rifts that appear in the world, an update to the combat to include shields, a rework of the wind shader, a rework of the liquid system, a new optional permadeath mode and the list just keeps going. Check out the new update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2u5QIsnLetw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e963c19642917a11d526d9fa3ff0fb17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2u5QIsnLetw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not just big additions though, there's plenty of smaller bits to make playing it easier like WASD scrolling on the world map, lots of gameplay balancing, bug fixes and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/forums/topic/6214-homesteading-part-2-combat-update-stable-1160/" target="_blank">release announcement</a> has all the specifics.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/vintage-story?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and the <a href="http://www.vintagestory.at/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Project Zomboid has big plans for 2022 and beyond, with NPCs on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a great many years in Early Access, Project Zomboid has finally hit the big time with it regularly seeing multiple tens of thousands of players and they have <a href="https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2022/01/2022-and-beyond/" target="_blank">some big plans</a>. The latest release (Build 41) took a long time, as it reworked so much of the game but it's done and they're moving onto the next big chunk of features and it all sounds rather exciting.</p>
<p>One big addition that has been talked about for years is the addition of NPCs, and they're finally coming - for reals this time. They've split into different teams to work on different things, one team being focused on getting NPCs all hooked up and working.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586179961641897784gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586179961641897784gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>NPCs being the most requested feature of the game, they decided to do them before pets and hunting because "a big reason for not being comfortable with hunting and pets being first, is they are still NPCs and would necessarily leverage all the technology we’ve being working on for years at this point". To get there, another team will be working alongside them on normal content patches for Build 42 but they're trying to get NPCs actually release as soon as they can.</p>
<p>Until NPCs arrive, Build 42 sounds like it's going to be pretty impressive too, greatly expanding the "tech tree" for crafting as they say: "our ultimate goal is to provide significantly extra crafting potential to allow players to effectively create a post-apocalypse nu medieval community, to provide plausable alternatives to any of the lootable items in the game that would logically be plausable with the correct skills and resources so players don’t feel pressured to restart the early game repeatedly to get long term fun out of the game".</p>
<p>Sounds fancy. We're going to need to take a properly look at the modern Project Zomboid soon.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 8: Shovelware with a Penguin</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-7-the-arena-eternal/" target="_blank">Part 7: The Arena Eternal</a></strong></p>
<p>After completing all of the boxed <em>Quake</em> games for Linux, I was left with indecision. So if I could not settle on a single game to play, why not try one hundred? <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> is a software compilation put out by Canadian publisher Global Star Software. Made for a time of slow internet speeds and limited storage, these kinds of retail collections allowed users to explore hundreds of freeware and shareware titles from the comfort of a single CD-ROM.</p>
<p>Even at their height at around the turn of the millennium the true value of these sets was disputed, with the moniker "shovelware" often being used to mock the tendency of these compilations to value quantity over quality. It also feels an especially odd fit for Linux, where having a wide variety of free software packaged alongside the operating system was already the norm dating back to the earliest Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Indeed, the vast majority of the games included here are free and open source software that were already available in most Linux software repositories. With the exception of the commercial game demos, all this compilation brings to the table is the inclusion of an interactive menu. Written in Python it allows you to select a game, visit its website, display the game's manual page, and then either install the game to the hard drive or, when applicable, run it off the CD-ROM.</p>
<p>This second option is more useful than it sounds if you consider the fact I am only running a six gigabyte hard drive. Being able to play the games without installing them first is a blessing, and almost justifies not just utilizing the system package manager. The compilation itself is RPM based with official support being offered for both Red Hat Linux 6.0 and Caldera OpenLinux 2.3, the latter of which is included in the set as a bonus alongside a variation of the <em>Loki Demo Disc</em>.</p>
<p>The box touts that support for other distributions is possible by compiling the included game source code, an interesting way of trying to make a sales pitch out of a licensing requirement. Thankfully my install of Red Hat Linux 7.3 is close enough to not offer up too many issues as long as you bypass the distribution version check by launching the setup script on the disc with "./setup rh" as root and then the menu system itself with the "./gss-install rh" command.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12598378211641761339gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12598378211641761339gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5563808351641701424gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5563808351641701424gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Even then I found that the install buttons would do nothing, although it would recognize if I installed the RPM packages off the disc myself. Most of the games included are straight X11 or even console based, often featuring basic graphics, unusual keybindings, and no sound effects apart from the PC speaker, typically being variations on old Atari or Commodore classics. Given that I will not be going through them all here, but I will highlight a few standouts.</p>
<p><em>The Ace of Penguins</em> is a lovely hand crafted suite of card and tile games; I have fond memories of playing <em>Taipei</em> as a kid from Knoppix back in the day. <em>Rocks &amp; Diamonds</em> and <em>Mirror Magic</em> by Holger Schemel are notable for their quality graphics and sound effects. <em>XScavenger</em> is a solid take on the game <em>Lode Runner</em>, while <em>Lincity</em> and <em>Freeciv</em> are ambitious remakes of <em>SimCity </em>and <em>Civilization</em>, albeit now heavily outdated. <em>XEvil</em> is a fun fighting game with a history all its own.</p>
<p>By far the game with the most flair however is the demo for the graphic adventure <em>Hopkins FBI</em>, one of the earliest sold Linux titles created by French developer MP Entertainment. I actually managed to get this to work on a more recent release of Fedora some years ago, but the game speed was off making the cat shoot around like a rocket among other things. The full version for Linux has become hard to find, so it is a shame that only the shareware is included here.</p>
<p>This was one of the many disappointments common to these shovelware sets, with them also being notorious for being cheaply produced. That rule also applies here, with the menus often featuring inconsistent text descriptions, mismatched screenshots, and a number of the games refusing to load even after running the setup script. It also appears to be coded to launch websites in Netscape, although this can be overruled with the BROWSER environment variable.</p>
<p>Although <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> was the only official product from the company to support Linux, Global Star Software also published a wide variety of budget video game releases, some of which happened to come from developers that were also Linux friendly. This would place them in the curious position of releasing a game which, completely inadvertent to them, was for the longest time the only retail version available that could successfully be completed on Linux.</p>

      <title>Check out the original Half-Life with Ray Tracing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play with some real-time path tracing in Half-Life? Well, a modder is doing just that and has released a small teaser to show it off.</p>
<p>The work is actually based on an <a href="https://github.com/w23/xash3d-fwgs" target="_blank">existing effort</a>, which will bring Vulkan Ray Tracing into Xash3D FWGS, a game engine that's compatible with classic Valve games designed for modding. The modder going by sultim_t, mentions their work will see the source code released when the mod is ready. They said it will provide hardware accelerated ray tracing with the possibility to "calculate global illumination, reflections, refractions, soft shadows and other visual effects with interactive framerates".</p>
<p>Until it's out, you can see what they showed off below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SsteDE8h6jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c30b578463c440469e6cde7cbdaedec0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SsteDE8h6jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They say Half-Life: RAY TRACED will be out in 2022 for "Windows", but that's never stopped us before has it? Given the source code will be out, it hopefully won't be too difficult to get it working, especially as the existing work it's based upon is cross-platform.</p>

      <title>Upcoming GZDoom-powered FPS Selaco shows off the &#39;AI Response System&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if I could get any more excited? Selaco just looks simply incredible in the footage we've seen previously, this new GZDoom-powered FPS is going to kick-ass.</p>
<p>One of the big features is the FEAR-inspired AI system, where the enemies actually work together properly to take you down. They're aware of each other, use different tactics depending on the situation and so on. It does sound exciting and the latest video shows it off a little more. Oh, you also get to flip things for cover which is clearly awesome.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mUNPJ9RGb7Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5f20049d1c00f7059089a9de2d719e78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mUNPJ9RGb7Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A lengthy story-driven campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Selaco is a story-driven experience, and we don't say that lightly. A dedicated writer has been brought on board to assist with creating an engaging and believable sci-fi story and world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intense Action set pieces</li>
</ul>
<p>Turn the entire world into confetti with the destructive power of your weapons. Every single bullet will react properly with any materials or objects you hit. Our artists have created many different variations for each (voxel)object to ensure that the aftermath of each encounter is palpable. That once lavish office space now nothing but a pile of rubble with broken paintings, smashed tables, screen, chairs, smoke, and chunks of debris.</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom AI</li>
</ul>
<p>With our FEAR influence, writing proper AI was a goal from the get go. The enemy is fully aware of each other's presence and work together to take you down. They will keep their distance if you apply constant pressure on them, will rush you if you hide or run out of bullets, toss grenades if you use the same cover for too long, and much more. Hundreds of custom lines have been written and acted out, providing hints to the player about their current plans and tactics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full soundtrack</li>
</ul>
<p>Selaco is accompanied by a full length original soundtrack composed by an experienced musician who has worked on many games in the past.</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional voice-acting.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help immerse players in the story and atmosphere of Selaco, professional voice actors have been brought on board. Dawn will be voiced by the incredibly talented Melissa Medina, with other casting choices revealed at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's quite some time away from release yet but don't let that stop you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">heading over to Steam</a> and hitting that wishlist button.</p>
<p>You can also support the developer <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PlaySelaco" target="_blank">on Patreon</a>.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells: The Queen and the Sea DLC is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another run? Dead Cells: The Queen and the Sea DLC is out now and brings with it plenty of new enemies to hack and slash your way through.</p>
<p>The release came with a fancy animated trailer to feast your eyes on:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ezDxvFUxDvc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/535a404551f7230e1be66d2a788284bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ezDxvFUxDvc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What do you actually get with the DLC? Well, apart from finishing off the path they started with The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls, there's new areas to explore including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infested Shipwreck: </strong>Fight through the claustrophobic hallways of a sunken vessel, while multi-legged eldritch abominations hunt you from the shadows.</li>
<li><strong>Lighthouse: </strong>Ascend this soaring tower while fending off the relentless attacks of the Queen’s Guardians and outrunning the hungry flames rising from below.</li>
<li><strong>The Crown: </strong>Try to get off this cursed island by lighting the beacon at the lighthouse summit. However, your past won’t let you go without a fight.</li>
<li>Plus there's 9 new weapons that include: a throwable shark, a trident and a pirate hook hand.</li>
<li>A new pet, new outfits and plenty of new enemies too.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you prefer to see actual gameplay, there's a trailer for that too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AvS0JdWMjqw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/564e8175586e8e88e9e1b3e5c4c43170.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AvS0JdWMjqw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All the DLC purchases help to support the ongoing development of Dead Cells, with more free updates planned and it also goes towards Motion Twin's next project that's currently under development. We're expecting at least another year of free updates, which they announced previously. It may be longer, if sales keep up.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 20.3 is out with theme adjustments, Document Manager, Dark Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another brand new distribution release with Linux Mint 20.3 now officially available following the Beta release in December 2021. Not much has changed since the Beta, other than ensuring any nasty bugs didn't slip through to provide a pretty good desktop experience for both new and experienced users who want the simple life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5406709051641812559gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5406709051641812559gol1.png"/></a>Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon Screenshot</em></p>
<p>The look and feel of Linux Mint has been tweaked with this release to have larger titlebar buttons, rounded corners and an overall "cleaner" theme with better dark mode support - plus a bunch of new rather lush looking backgrounds to pick from. Accent colouring to grab your attention in places was also adjusted, and removed from some places. There's also the ability for some applications to have a dark theme while the desktop keeps its lighter theme. Only a few applications currently support this mixed theming.</p>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching in the Sticky Notes app.</li>
<li>A new Document Manager called Thingy.</li>
<li>Hypnotix IPTV player gained a search feature.</li>
<li>Multi-calendar events support in the Cinnamon Calendar.</li>
<li>Workspace switcher applet: Option to disable scrolling.</li>
<li>Notification applet: Option to hide the counter.</li>
<li>Window list applet: Option to remove labels.</li>
<li>Xreader PDF reader received better support for manga.</li>
<li>Cinnamon has support for 3x fractional scaling when the hardware allows it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the internals includes: Kernel 5.4, a packaging base of Ubuntu 20.04, Flatpak 1.12, linux-firmware 1.187 and depending on what edition you go for there's Cinnamon 5.2, MATE 1.26 and Xfce 4.16.</p>
<p>Linux Mint 20.3 will receive security updates until 2025, with the distribution moving over to a newer Ubuntu package base later this year.</p>
<p>The announcements can be seen on the <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Mint Blog</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Kernel 5.16 is out now bringing the futex2 work to help Linux Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds has <a href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2201.1/00613.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the release of Linux Kernel 5.16, bringing with it the usual assortment of new hardware support and improvements everywhere. Plus, there's something big for Linux gaming fans.</p>
<p>The one many have no doubt been waiting for is the inclusion of Collabora's work on <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/futex2.html" target="_blank">FUTEX2</a> with futex_waitv(). This is supposed to help Linux gaming with Proton / Wine and also Native Linux gaming too. As Collabora developer André Almeida previously described it: "The use case of this syscall is to allow low level locking libraries to wait for multiple locks at the same time. This is specially useful for emulating Windows' WaitForMultipleObjects. A futex_waitv()-based solution has been used for some time at Proton's Wine (a compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux). Compared to a solution that uses eventfd(), futex was able to reduce CPU utilization for games, and even increase frames per second for some games. This happens because eventfd doesn't scale very well for a huge number of read, write and poll calls compared to futex. Native game engines will benefit of this as well, given that this wait pattern is common for games.".</p>
<p>So with this Kernel version, plus a version of Proton / Wine and any Native games / game engines that support it, you <em>might</em> be able to see better performance.</p>
<p>Masses of other changes as well of course, although plenty of it most normal consumers won't be too excited about just yet. However a few noteworthy interesting bits for desktop / laptop users and gamers (more on <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges#Linux_5.16" target="_blank">KernelNewbies</a>) like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The addition of DisplayPort 2.0 for AMD GPU</li>
<li>Initial USB4 DP tunnelling support for AMD GPU</li>
<li>More work towards supporting Intel Xe discrete GPUs</li>
<li>Improvements for the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller</li>
<li>Better support of HP Omen laptops</li>
<li>A small fix for the Steam Deck screen</li>
<li>Nintendo Joy-Con and Pro Controller support</li>
<li>Hardware monitoring support for many more ASUS motherboards</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that didn't take long now did it? After hitting a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/steam-hit-a-new-all-time-user-count-close-to-28m-to-start-2022/" target="_blank">new high on January 2</a> that was very close to the big milestone, just today Steam officially passed 28 million users online.</p>
<p>The fun thing is while preparing this article, the record got smashed repeatedly again. It went from 28,091,667 to 28,122,386 and then 28,155,279 in the blink of an eye. This new all-time peak is with 7,908,863 people actually playing a game, which you can see confirmed on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what was in the top most played at the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>ARK: Survival Evolved</li>
<li>Football Manager 2022</li>
<li>Team Fortress 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Just how many of those millions will buy a Steam Deck though? It's going to be fun to find out.</p>

      <title>Easy Anti-Cheat not as simple as expected for Proton and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/epic-games-announce-full-easy-anti-cheat-for-linux-including-wine-a-proton/" target="_blank">announced recently</a> how they expanded support for Easy Anti-Cheat to have full support of native Linux, plus Wine / Proton (and so the Steam Deck), it seems it's not as easy as we hoped.</p>
<p>In the original announcement, Epic mentioned how it can be enabled with "a few clicks in the Epic Online Services Developer Portal" but the situation is never that simple. A developer of Warhammer: Vermintide 2 has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=6#c3202622271470957243" target="_blank">written a post on Steam</a> to explain, noting that there are <em>two</em> versions of EAC. There's the original and the newer version used via Epic Online Services. The majority of games are likely still with the old version, since the newer one needs SDK upgrades and newer integrations.</p>
<p>We already knew that developers needed the latest SDK from the original announcement, but this makes it simpler for us all to understand.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="commentthread_comment_text" id="comment_content_3202622271470957243">So we have looked in to this. It's far more complex than first suspected -- EAC has two versions. Non-EOS and EOS (Epic Online Services). Most games historically use Non-EOS EAC. It's the one Vermintide 2 uses as well. Epic only added Proton support for the EOS version of EAC. Therefor in order to implement proton support for Vermintide 2, a huge amount of reworking of the EAC implementation would be required, which may also require all players to authenticate with Epic Online Services as well -- perhaps even logging in to the Epic environment (to be confirmed, however).<br/>
<br/>
So the "just a few clicks" statement made in the original announcement wasn't entirely accurate, and would only apply to titles using the EOS version of EAC, which simply hasn't been many games aside from either pretty new ones, and likely predominantly Epic exclusive titles.<br/>
<br/>
We are still looking at what is or isn't going to be possible, but it's not as easy as it was made out to be -- far from it in fact.<br/>
<br/>
There may be other solutions or workarounds, but ripping out the old EAC and rewriting everything to implement "NuEAC" and <em>potentially</em> asking our entire playerbase to connect through and sign through EOS for an honestly tiny market share that was (and would remain) unsupported from the get go might be a deal breaker.<br/>
<br/>
Time will tell.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>One part we already know <em>not</em> to be true, is a requirement of Epic Online Services authentication, as the developers of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/brawlhalla-to-get-easy-anti-cheat-dev-puts-up-beta-with-eac-working-on-linux-with-proton/" target="_blank">Brawlhalla</a> showed in their own testing with the new integration which worked <em>without</em> users touching Epic's services directly.  The other point remains though, as developers won't upgrade from the older implementation to the newer without a good reason, due to extra work involved when the older one is still getting the latest EAC updates as normal (as confirmed in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=7#c3202622271471186471" target="_blank">a later post</a>). Although, there may come a time Epic force EOS for it, but it stands to reason they haven't currently as it would have been a big upheaval for so many developers using it and likely caused plenty of developer backlash there.</p>
<p>Tripwire Interactive also hinted towards the exact same thing, when asked about hooking up support for<br/>
Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/linux-support-for-easy-anticheat.2329543/#post-2350472" target="_blank">developer noted</a> back in September 2021, "The version of EAC used on RS 2 is not the version that is advertised in this, and it is not something that will work for RS 2 players.".</p>
<p>Hopefully the actual work involved in moving from old EAC to new isn't too much, but it's a reason why we've yet to see any really look to do it. Once the Steam Deck is out though, it should improve, if enough players ask developers to get it sorted, otherwise players may have to resort to a manual install of Windows on the Steam Deck instead of SteamOS 3 to play some of the most popular multiplayer titles.</p>

      <title>Tiny Life is an upcoming pixel-art take on experiences like The Sims</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Life is an upcoming game trying to capture the essence of games like The Sims, but in an isometric pixelart style. If you've played The Sims before, you mostly know sort-of what to expect from it. Build a house, have a family and take care of all their needs - or totally mess with them. You're basically god watching over a few select people.</p>
<p>Tiny Life's creator, the solo indie developer Ellpeck, has always loved casual life simulation games like The Sims, Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. For multiple years, he deemed the prospect of making a complex life simulation game similar to The Sims too difficult, until he started working on Tiny Life and realized that it is, indeed, quite the task. Nevertheless, he has been working on the game regularly for over a year and considers it his passion project.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HkQDooqdlRI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/601f1cff3186f6f22a8d4046dc7cbaa1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HkQDooqdlRI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create your own characters with unique personalities and skills and dress them however you like</li>
<li>Build houses and community spaces like parks and cafés and watch households inhabit them</li>
<li>Control your household and tell your characters what to do, from cooking food to learning complex skills like programming and painting</li>
<li>Have your characters interact, build relationships, grow families and live unique lives</li>
<li>Share your creations with the community by exporting lots and households from your game</li>
<li>Create additional content through the game's built-in C# modding API</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to admit I've not played The Sims since probably the second one released back in 2004. Some fond memories though, there's not much out there like it and so it's quite fun to see someone else do a take on it.</p>
<p>Want to try it out? There's a free Alpha on <a href="https://ellpeck.itch.io/tiny-life" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and you can wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out some fresh Haunted Chocolatier screenshots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Haunted Chocolatier is the next game from Stardew Valley creator ConcernedApe (Eric Barone), we still don't yet know a huge amount about it but the dev recently showed some fresh screenshots. These are just some small teasers, with Barone mentioning on their <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to expect plenty more throughout 2022.</p>
<p>On December 25, Barone mentioned the game is "making good progress" and currently work is progressing on the "core elements of the game". We don't expect to get a lot of info before a true full reveal, as Barone mentioned "I don’t really feel like sharing much, because I’d rather let the game be a surprise than reveal everything. I just like working in secret".</p>
<p>The first shot shows off some ghosts in some sort of laboratory, conducting some of that sweet science.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4145284231641554809gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4145284231641554809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Later on Twitter you can also see these two newer images (click to enlarge):</p>

<p>Given the popularity of Stardew Valley, there's of course a lot of eyes watching to see how this turns out. Are you excited for Haunted Chocolatier?</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 29 brings fixes for Aya Neo, GPD Win 3 and more upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to refine the SteamOS-like full-screen experience, ChimeraOS 29 is out now bringing on upgrades and plenty of bug fixes too.</p>
<p>The usual main components have been upgraded including Linux Kernel 5.15.12, Mesa drivers 21.3.3, NVIDIA driver 495.46, RetroArch 1.9.14 and upgrades to their own special helper packages too. Users of a few handhelds will be happy too with ChimeraOS 29 bringing fixed WiFI on the Aya Neo 2021 Pro/Retro Power, there's now a touch-screen driver for the GPD Win 3 and another hardware fix is to stop the ASRock LED controller being recognized as a joystick.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21139055731641553519gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21139055731641553519gol1.jpg"/></a><em>It boots directly into Steam Big Picture mode for a console-like experience.</em></p>
<p>Along with that there's also some additional libraries added as required by Worms W.M.D, fixed hidden/flickering popup windows in some games, fixed game patches not applying on first boot, improved reliability of downloading and applying game patches and tweaks, an updated default Nintendo 64 config to reduce artifacts on 2D graphical elements and they also updated install media with improved internet connection detection and experimental Intel/Nvidia hybrid graphics support.</p>
<p>I'm still keen to see how ChimeraOS will evolve once SteamOS 3 has a public release. No doubt there will be plenty of things it continues to do that Valve won't be able to do officially (or won't want to do) with SteamOS. Just like you have Proton GE that does things the official Proton doesn't.</p>

      <title>Liftoff: FPV Drone Racing gets a huge physics update, new racing environment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Liftoff: FPV Drone Racing is a very good simulator and it just got that little bit better, with update 1.4.0 out now bringing some major improvements.</p>
<p>Going back to the drawing board for the physics system, LuGus Studios decided to rely less on Unity's built-in physics with their new flight controller, the result is that overall in many places it should perform better. Something that also sounds fancy is a new " A.I. PID tune feature" that will adjust "itself based on the system's performance for a perfectly tuned setup in light" but you can still tune things manually.</p>
<p>They also upgraded the Unity version used, added a new environment with three tracks and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/410340/view/3135066917516836875" target="_blank">quite a bit more</a>.</p>
<p>Check out their short video on the new racing environment:</p>

<p>The most recent user reviews are looking good too giving it an Overwhelmingly Positive score and a Very Positive score overall. Seems like plenty of people enjoy this one!</p>

      <title>Dell announce the new XPS 13 Plus with Ubuntu supported</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During CES 2022 Dell <a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/blog/xps-13-reinvents-itself-embracing-simplicity-as-the-new-premium/" target="_blank">announced</a> the brand new XPS 13 Plus, which overhauls the design and it looks pretty slick. They've confirmed that Ubuntu 20.04 will also still be a supported option, on their Developer Edition.</p>
<p>"Our most powerful XPS 13 was redesigned from the ground up to be our highest-performing flagship ever, so users can do everything they love faster. New modern and simplified interiors are beautiful and provide a seamless touch experience for customers. Stunning displays and enhanced audio bring your content to life. Crafted of machined aluminum and glass in Platinum or Graphite." — Dell.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/398973171641549786gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's small, thin and light and with the redesign it's about the same size as before with a few major differences.</p>
<p>The one you can notice right away is the new capacitive touch bar above the keyboard, allowing you to switch between function and media keys. It looks fantastic but, I'm always a little wary of these special touch bars. It's not as fancy as the one on the MacBook, which would hopefully mean it would have less problems. At least the new edge-to-edge keyboard looks like it has decent spacing for comfortable typing.</p>
<p>They've also stretched-out the fans to the outer-edges, which they say gives "up to 55%" more airflow allowing it to be more powerful while also keeping the size and without increasing noise or temperature.</p>
<p>The screen sounds rather nice too. With it you're getting a 13.4-inch 16:10 aspect ratio OLED "InfinityEdge" display, they say it gives "7.4 million pixels are individually lit, turning off completely for black, so dark areas are true black or perfect black, so content comes alive with breathtaking detail especially in dark areas".</p>
<p>Specifications depend on what model you go for, options include:</p>

      <title>System76 tease their new &#39;Kudu&#39; laptop with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for a new high-end laptop for your Linux needs? System76, makers of Pop!_OS have teased their latest with the Kudu that blends together the worlds of AMD and NVIDIA.</p>
<p>"The Kudu laptop is for expert multitaskers. The rub-belly-pat-head types. The Mach 12 errand runners. The kind of thinker who can open 10 doors with 1 makeshift key.</p>
<p>Whatever your missions, get them done faster with the Kudu laptop. Between the H-class CPU and 3000-Series NVIDIA graphics, you’ll be the ultimate conductor in a multitasking concerto." — System76.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10414973121641488738gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Starting at $1899, this is one laptop that sounds like it will handle close to anything you throw at it. With the choice of having it pre-installed with Pop!_OS 21.10, Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.</p>
<p>They're only teasing it but they did at least give out the basic specifications, although they don't note what the base model will have in terms of RAM and things like that, we're just given vague details on the max support so far:</p>

      <title>Relic Space shows off its very satisfying space roguelike gameplay in a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love space sci-fi and roguelikes? Relic Space blends them together and it's really beginning to look like a game that's going to steal endless hours away from me.</p>
<p>Relic Space is a turn-based, roguelike RPG in which you help rebuild civilisation following a galactic catastrophe. Through varied missions as a single starship pilot you will engage in deeply simulated, hex-based combat with an innovative, fluid feel - all set within an epic sci-fi narrative that you help construct through your choices. A bit like Jupiter Hell, the movement is so fluid you often don't remember it's taking a turn each time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XJbK32rh54A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6b46a2867268a04efdec62aafd5e1b4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XJbK32rh54A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer put up a public demo recently and it's <em>really</em> come along, with a couple of hours gameplay available it gives a great look into the game. Heavily inspired by traditional roguelikes, the developer mentions they wish to "break new ground with the variety and complexity of randomly generated missions, and their associated subplots". While it will have a main story campaign, it sounds like there's going to be a lot you can replay through and have it all be different each time.</p>
<p>You can check out the new <a href="https://logophil.itch.io/relicspace" target="_blank">demo on itch.io</a> and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1146420/Relic_Space/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Wilderness survival roguelike Wayward &#34;Horizons&#34; upgrade brings Volcanic islands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another major update has landed for the sweet top-down wilderness survival roguelike Wayward, bringing with it a whole new Volcanic island type and much more.</p>
<p>The game will also now load up several islands at a time, which helps with quicker travel and means players in multiplayer can actually be on different islands now - so it opens the game up a whole lot more. Have a look at the Horizons upgrade release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jgahWzMnVuI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8049b2d9acdb6ca5ebad45d053107771.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jgahWzMnVuI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a new "islands" dialog, acting as a world map. It's unlocked when obtaining a sea-worthy vessel, which allows you to travel to inspect and travel to nearby islands.</li>
<li>You can now sail to any island within a certain distance, the travel time and cost dependant on the distance traveled.</li>
<li>Several islands can now be loaded at a time, allowing for quicker travel and allowing players in multiplayer games to be on different islands from each other.</li>
<li>Added a new "Seafaring" skill which increases travel distances, reduces hunger and thirst costs when traveling, and more.</li>
<li>Added a new "Volcanic" island type and biome with new resources, tiles, interactions, and creatures.</li>
<li>Added the ability to assign quickslots with tool-based actions (similar to "Carve with Tool" previously from the action menu). Alternatively, you can perform actions here by opening a new menu as well with "Shift + Q or Shift + Right Click". These actions will automatically pick the best tool for the given action.</li>
<li>Added ability to assign action menu actions to the quickslot bar.</li>
<li>A new item quality, "Relic", has been added. Relics have a high amount of magical properties, but have low starting durability and are dropped exclusively from aberrant creatures and treasure chests.</li>
<li>Added a "Rejoin as a new player" button to the death screen when dying in multiplayer games that have "clear ghost data on leave" option enabled.</li>
<li>Added a "Respawn in Casual Mode" button to the death screen when you die while in a permadeath mode so you can continue playing your save.</li>
<li>Merchant NPCs will now spawn and restock based on the number of buildings (walls/floors) constructed on an island, and will decrease in odds the further out you are from your starting island.</li>
<li>Added a couple of new craftable "scarecrows" that you can place down to prevent or reduce the likelihood of creatures spawning and/or movement around them (depending on the creature).</li>
<li>Added a new armor set of "armored scale" with unique properties/usefulness.</li>
<li>Added needles for all types of metal.</li>
<li>Added a pangolin creature to the new "Volcanic" island type.</li>
<li>Added mysterious and coveted "Dryad", a plant-like creature with unique properties and loot.</li>
<li>Added "Master of All" milestone and milestone modifier for getting all skills to 100%.</li>
<li>Added the "Traitor" milestone and milestone modifier.</li>
<li>Added a new form of grass called "Tanglehead", spread throughout the arid and volcanic islands types. Dirt will no longer be native to arid islands as a result.</li>
<li>Added a new magical property "Regeneration", which repairs/restores durability on items over time.</li>
<li>Added a new magical property, "Aptitude", which multiplies its effectiveness in crafts.</li>
<li>Added a new interaction with wisps.</li>
<li>The main menu buttons and tabs across all menus now have associated icons to improve UX.</li>
<li>Sailing to new islands now raises your cartography skill.</li>
<li>Starting at 40% cartography skill, the islands map and item tooltips now show which map items are associated with each island.</li>
<li>Introduced the concept of spores to mushrooms and ferns.</li>
<li>There are now non-tattered versions of shirts and pants that are available to craft.</li>
<li>Added an "Open Backups Folder" button to the save data section in the options menu.</li>
<li>You can now drag and drop save files onto the game to import them.</li>
<li>Added +dev command line switch to dedicated servers to enable developer mode.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the new demo for party-based RPG Call of Saregnar</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving a firm nod to classic 90s RPGs, you can try out a brand new demo for the upcoming Call of Saregnar. Blending together low-res visuals, with shots of real-life actors for the conversations, it's certainly a weird looking mix but it absolutely works.</p>
<p>Not seen it before? Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="igjNzMW9_qU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dbbc56e749ec6cbe5a0a4dc212a0b7fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/igjNzMW9_qU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Call of Saregnar is a nod to the wonderful era of party-based RPGs from the 90's. It’s got an intriguing story and interesting characters in a unique low-fantasy medieval setting. The graphics are charmingly old-school with billboard trees and a low-poly 3D world. All the characters are photographs and frame sequences of real actors, that you can interact with, see them in the world and fight with. The combat system is a turn-based hex grid affair with many tactical options. Also the game has a magic systems based on gods and divine favour, which is really unique and immersive. Overall the game has a very relaxing pace, and it feels like reading a good novel; Makes you feel right at home."</p>
<p>Features at a glance:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>10 chapters involving a mature story in a believable world,</li>
<li>A tribute to the early 90’s: Low-poly 3D, hand-pixelated custom goodness,</li>
<li>Real-life digitized actors as characters,</li>
<li>100% hand-built levels, 100% hand-placed props, enemies and items,</li>
<li>An open world to explore, filled with engaging NPCs, locations and quests which support the main storyline,</li>
<li>Classless per-use skill-based character development,</li>
<li>Strategic turn-based hex grid combat,</li>
<li>Unique magic system based on divine favour,</li>
<li>Less is more: fewer, but well-defined items,</li>
<li>You won't find a quest marker here, just a map and a journal to aid you in your quest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174510/Call_of_Saregnar/" target="_blank">demo now on Steam</a>. It's built with Unity and seems to work great on Linux in my own testing.</p>

      <title>Easily install and upgrade Proton GE or Luxtorpeda with ProtonUp-Qt</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There are certain Windows games that work better on Linux with the community-built unofficial <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">Proton GE</a>, plus using <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> for Native Linux game engines can give a lot of benefits too - here's how to easily download or upgrade them using the fab <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>.</p>
<p>It's an application based on the command-line tool ProtonUp, however ProtonUp-Qt actually gives you a full UI and it really just makes everything nice and <u>simple</u>. Do you use Lutris or the Heroic Games Launcher? ProtonUp-Qt can also easily setup Wine-GE for you too.</p>
<p>To install it simply grab it from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a> or run the AppImage from the <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases" target="_blank">releases page</a>. This couldn't be simpler! Once installed you get this easy to understand UI to pick between Steam, Lutris and Heroic and then install whatever compatibility tool you want that it supports by hitting "Add version":</p>

      <title>ΔV: Rings of Saturn continues to be popular with Linux gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems that Kodera Software continue to be impressed by the level of Linux sales on Steam for their space mining sim ΔV: Rings of Saturn. Be sure to also check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/an-interview-with-kodera-software-creator-of-the-hard-sci-fi-dv-rings-of-saturn/" target="_blank">our previous interview</a> with the developer.</p>
<p>What is it? A physics-based mining sim, set in the thickest debris field in Sol. Every action has a reaction, lasers are invisible without a medium, and your thrust is a potent weapon. Find trade, adapt your equipment to your playstyle, hire a crew to help. Unravel the mysteries of the rings, or just get rich.</p>
<p>Developed with <a href="http://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, the developer has announced a few times how sales have been going across different platforms and they recently gave another update on <a href="https://twitter.com/KoderaSoftware/status/1478411285662470150" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to see if things had changed. They included a chart showing some pretty reasonable looking sales for Linux:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11939459821641395105gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11939459821641395105gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>According to the Twitter post, the game has had a recently surge in popularity so it's really interesting to see that the Linux numbers have held up for it.</p>
<p>You can buy ΔV: Rings of Saturn on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/846030/V_Rings_of_Saturn/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://koder.itch.io/dv-rings-of-saturn" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Mozilla looking to improve Twitch playback in Firefox</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love watching Twitch livestreams? I bet there's plenty amongst our readers! Well, it seems Mozilla are looking into making it better with Firefox.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/rw6ccb/feedback_wanted_twitch_performance_in_firefox/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, <em>jrmuizel</em> a Gfx team Engineer at Mozilla said: "Over the past while, I've noticed quite a few reports of people complaining that Twitch has worse performance in Firefox vs Chrome/Edge. I'm hoping to spend some more time on fixing this over the next little while and am looking for more specifics on how and when it's worse for people.</p>
<p>If anyone sees this (or uses Twitch and doesn't see it) please respond with some details including what kind of computer you're using, and how to reproduce the problem."</p>
<p>The only problem I usually have is certain areas seemingly at random fail to load, with an error message of "Failed to load module", which usually goes away with a refresh. It's quite a nuisance though.</p>
<p>Have you had issues with Twitch and Firefox? Might be time to speak up and let your problems be known, and who knows a future Firefox release might fix it. Head over to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/rw6ccb/feedback_wanted_twitch_performance_in_firefox/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> to let the developer know.</p>

      <title>Remnants of the Precursors is a modern take on Master of Orion out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developed as a modern reincarnation of the original Master of Orion, the free and open source Remnants of the Precursors is officially out now. It's been in development for somewhere around 6 years, with the big 1.0 landing on December 25.</p>
<p>Master of Orion is an absolute classic, and the sequel is one of the games that firmly cemented my absolute love of video games so seeing the genre live on in such a way is awesome. According to the developer "ROTP takes that original award-winning formula and adds high quality artwork, writing, graphical design and AI development to recreate the authentic experience of the original game. There is arguably more quality artwork and writing in ROTP than in almost any space 4X game currently on the market".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VusDAxLpJ9I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b309ed22d40c0302d8185095b844d900.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VusDAxLpJ9I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer further mentioned that "Each of the ten races has personalized dialogue that aligns with their racial tendencies to bring them to life in a way not possible in MOO1. Which race you choose to play really makes a difference in your tactics, and knowing who your neighbors are and what they care about is an important part of playing well." — and also that — "The technology tree is variable each game and has a real effect on how you design your ships. You can't research every tech, so you will often need to resort to diplomacy, espionage or even war to acquire technologies you desire. Ship combat is turn-based, allowing you to directly command your fleet against the enemy or some of the dangerous space monsters. There is no "blob vs blob" ship combat in ROTP".</p>
<p>Sounds like a huge amount of effort and attention to detail went into this.</p>
<p>Available free / pay what you want from <a href="https://rayfowler.itch.io/remnants-of-the-precursors" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and the source is up on <a href="https://github.com/rayfowler/rotp-public" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. There's a few different licenses depending on the code / artwork but it's looking good.</p>

      <title>LatencyFleX offers a generic open source latency reduction middleware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to reduce latency? There's now a free and open source way with LatencyFleX, that gives a vendor and game agnostic latency reduction middleware that you can try out.</p>
<p>This can be used as an alternative to NVIDIA Reflex, for Windows games running through Proton that have it implemented directly, plus certain Linux builds of Unreal Engine 4 games and as a plugin / hook for Unity games too. An advantage of course is that you don't need an NVIDIA GPU, with the developer mentioning one of the motivations for creating it being only having an AMD GPU.</p>
<p>Plans also include to enable developers to integrate it into their game engines too. Overall it sounds like a really fantastic project and could be fun to try out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15908159181641380741gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15908159181641380741gol1.png"/></a>An example of LatencyFleX in action, credit to Tatsuyuki Ishi.</em></p>
<p>For a little more behind the scenes, you can check out the introduction <a href="https://ishitatsuyuki.github.io/post/latencyflex/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the Apache 2.0 license. Use at your own risk, especially games that have some form of anti-cheat.</p>

      <title>KDE finally gets root operations in Dolphin, big 2022 plans for Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE developer Nate Graham continues blogging about how KDE and Plasma are evolving and there's been some great improvements recently, along with some huge plans for 2022.</p>
<p>Making things easier for users is important and the KDE team are clearly taking on a lot of feedback. A major <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2021/12/31/this-week-in-kde-finally-root-file-operations-in-dolphin/" target="_blank">new feature</a> is that Dolphin, and anything that hooks into KIO, can now create, move, copy, trash, and delete files in non-user-owned locations. Instead of just giving you a warning and not letting you do anything, it should now ask for a password and let you do what you need to without resorting to a terminal window. Nice. This change should land in KDE Frameworks 5.91.</p>
<p>Wayland improvements also came in recently like supporting greater than 8-bit colour, the ability to open the current directory or any other folder you right-click on in any app, not just the file manager with Konsole.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17543030351641380470gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17543030351641380470gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for their <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/01/03/kde-roadmap-for-2022/" target="_blank">2022 plans</a>, which aren't set in stone, more of a guide - there's a lot!</p>
<p>One of the big things for 2022 is to have Wayland at a stage for KDE where it can completely replace the X11 session. Another I'm particularly interested in is improvements to multi-monitor support, modernizing Breeze icons and a big focus on what they're calling the "15 minute bug" initiative - to clean up issues that appear within the first 15 minutes of loading into Plasma.</p>
<p>Sounds like KDE and Plasma are going places in 2022. This is going to be good news for the Steam Deck too, since the desktop session uses Plasma.</p>

      <title>3D rendering engine OGRE 2.3 released adding Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more Vulkan goodness came recently with OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) releasing Ogre-Next 2.3.0 Deadalus just before Christmas.</p>
<p>While this isn't something us normal consumers will use, it's another bit of great free and open source tech and having it continue to advance is great. Vulkan is gradually starting to replace OpenGL in more places for gaming, which is good news for Linux.</p>
<p>Ogre-Next 2.3.0 considers its Vulkan support as "stable" and ready to go! They do mention that currently a known issue is integration with Qt, which they will get around to looking into and fixing up.</p>
<p>Are there any notable games using it? Quite a few actually including Scrap Mechanic, Kenshi, Torchlight, RUNNING WITH RIFLES, Hob, The Book of Unwritten Tales and a good number more you can see for yourself on <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/Engine/OGRE/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

      <title>Send help as I have discovered Bloons TD 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stepping slightly out of my comfort zone recently to try something different, I picked up a copy of Bloons TD 6 and I think I now may need help to tear myself away from it. Note: played with <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of strategy games but I usually go for the more base-building RTS types, with Tower Defense not something I go for often. Based on how it looks, Bloons TD 6 is a game I would say you could easily pass up and not think anything of it. I honestly thought it looked a bit, dare I say it, overly childish. Oh how I was wrong. Bloons TD 6 is a monster of a game but family friendly for sure.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20612905241641377784gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20612905241641377784gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Bloons TD 6 is, in a word, fantastic. It's not a new game, released originally back in December 2018 and so I'm a bit late to the game on this one but gosh it's good. Who would have thought that Monkeys popping balloons would make for a good Tower Defense game? I didn't, obviously. However, I can't be the only one who enjoys the simple pleasure of popping balloons in real life? Bloons TD 6 offers that in the hundreds and thousands of wow it sure is satisfying watching hundreds of balloons float around getting popped.</p>
<p>Not only can you blast through hundreds of hours by yourself but you can bring a friend too - or a few, as it has 4 player co-op. So I did and cross-platform multiplayer works exceptionally well even between a Linux machine running it through Proton and someone else on Windows (tested both joining / hosting). Simply beautiful.</p>
<p>There is only a small learning curve to Bloons TD 6 too, mainly requiring you to pay attention to the types of balloons coming and keeping an eye on the wave number, to be ready for special Bloons that appear on later waves that you need a few special upgraded Monkeys to overcome.</p>
<p>The only part I'm not keen on are the micro-transactions. However, you can get everything simply by playing and it's not even remotely difficult to unlock things (which you do constantly) so it has a reasonable balance there overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6967560161641377816gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6967560161641377816gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you enjoy Tower Defense games, go grab it. Bloons TD 6 might possibly be one of the best TD games ever made. Steam reviews back it up too with well over 100,000 user reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating, so you really don't need to just take my word for it. Constant updates too that add new features, new Monkeys, new maps and more.</p>
<p>The developer was also quite responsive when an issue appeared with Proton, submitting their own bug report to Valve that ended up getting fixed.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/960090/Bloons_TD_6/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today at their own CES 2022 event, Intel had some interesting announcements for PC fans with some new processors coming.</p>
<p>The first announcement was the new H-Series mobile processors, with the new top-end flagship being the Intel Core i9-12900HK. They also showed off the new P-Series for thin and light laptops. Check them out (click pics to enlarge):</p>

However, they did not specify clearly if these Arc models are only in laptops, and they only mentioned laptops directly.</p>
<p>XeSS is already being implemented into games, with Death Stranding Director's Cut edition (Windows PC) being a confirmed title to have it. Intel also announced studios including Studios 505 Games, Codemasters, EXOR Studios, Fishlabs, Hashbane, IOI, Illfonic, Kojima Productions, Massive Work Studio, PUBG Studios, Techland, Ubisoft and Wonder People working on adding in XeSS.</p>

<p>For desktop CPUs, Intel also announced another 22 new processors joining the 12th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family consisting of 65-watt and 35-watt versions. They also showed off newly designed Intel Laminar Coolers that accompany the new 65-watt processors that come in three variants from the top end to the bottom: Laminar RH1, Laminar RM1 and the Laminar RS1. The RH1 has controllable aRGB lighting too.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA announce GeForce RTX 3050, RTX 3090 Ti and high-end laptop GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CES 2022 continues with NVIDIA doing their presentation today where they announced more for their streaming service GeForce NOW, new monitors from parters with GSYNC and new GPUs.</p>
<p>Most of it was the usual marketing speak, along with showing off DLSS / RTX in a couple of titles like Rainbow Six Extraction, and an exclusive clip of Dying Light 2. However, they did eventually get to an actual announcement with the GeForce RTX 3050 with 8GB GDDR6 price starting $249 and availability expected on January 27.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13811261511641313293gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13811261511641313293gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Might this be a GPU we can actually buy? We hope so.</p>
<p>The new 360Hz G-Sync monitors they talked about did sound quite interesting though. Allowing you to transform them between 1440p and 1080p (turning 27-inch monitors into 25-inch). It sounds a little odd but it's supposed to help with games that can't hit the performance needed at the higher resolutions. The main target is e-sports and ultra-FPS gamers.</p>
<p>Over 160 new RTX laptops will be also be coming, along with a 4th generation of Max-Q. These new laptops include models with a new RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti. Both of which will be available February 1.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12125917831641313710gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12125917831641313710gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16189538481641313749gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16189538481641313749gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They also of course announced their latest monster with the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. No real details other than a few basic specs given like it having "24GB G6X memory, 40 shader teraflops, 78 RT teraflops, 320 tensor teraflops".</p>
<p>NVIDIA said to expect more details on this "BF GPU" later this month.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17901780521641314355gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17901780521641314355gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>AMD shows off new hardware at CES 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, AMD presented their 2022 Product Premiere at CES 2022 with a pre-recorded session hosted by Dr. Lisa Su.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what they announced</strong></p>
<p>AMD Ryzen 6000 Mobile Processors (APUs). Coming with the Zen 3+ 6nm cores, RDNA 2 graphics, USB4 support, PCI-E Gen 4, DDR5 / LPDDR5 support, WiFi 6 / 6E, BTLE 5.2, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2 and AV1 support with "up to" 24 hours battery life. They will also integrate the Microsoft Pluton security chip and AMD say it's the first APU with hardware raytracing. Another big claim being made is "twice the performance" of Ryzen 5000. Since it supports FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), they also showed off how much of a performance bump it can give. Ryzen 6000 will arrive in February.</p>
<p>Here's the list of their new mobile CPUs:</p>

      <title>Hypnagonia is an upcoming open source &#34;spire-like&#34; deckbuilder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love games like Slay the Spire? I sure do and so seeing a new free and open source game appear that's inspired by it has me a little excited. This is Hypnagonia. It's currently in development, although playable, it has plenty of work to be done to flesh it out into a full complete experience. Even so, you can easily see that the promise is there.</p>
<p>In Hypnagonia you are asleep, a dreamer and you've been somehow captured and pulled into a nightmare realm. It's a fun sounding idea and you lose if you wake up. The idea is that you're facing "Torments", which are a manifestation of things causing your nightmares. You attack by inspecting them, to try and understand them, while they cause you stress that builds up as anxiety until you wake up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18864965001641300888gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18864965001641300888gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Built with Godot Engine, the developer is looking for other developers to join in to build it into something special.</p>
<p>You can try it in your browser on <a href="https://dbzer0.itch.io/hypnagonia" target="_blank">itch.io</a> although I do recommend downloading for better performance. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/db0/hypnagonia" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Project Zomboid is finally getting the player recognition it deserves</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Zomboid has been hanging around in Early Access on Steam since the first year that Early Access was even thing, and after a long development period it seems it's finally seeing its popularity explode.</p>
<p>Going from an average of around 5-6 thousand players online, since the recent huge overhaul release it has <em>skyrocketed</em> upwards into Steam's top 100 list with it now regularly seeing over 50,000 players online. That's an astronomical increase and it seems it's been doing just as well on Twitch too with tens of thousands of viewers, which puts it in Twitch's top 20 constantly now beating the likes of Dead by Daylight and World of Warcraft. It's similar in a way to what happened with Among Us, for a game to suddenly become massively popular.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nPbsDmzZ3Oc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c6ea835366e11001a1c608899146153.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nPbsDmzZ3Oc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just seeing lots of players though - it's also reviewing very nicely. On Steam it has a Very Positive score for both the recent score (nearly 9,000 reviews) and overall (nearly 50,000 reviews). We wholeheartedly recommend it too. PZ works great on Linux and it's worthy of the current popularity for sure.</p>

      <title>Maui Shell seems like a very interesting KDE graphical environment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood to try a new desktop shell? Well, the folks behind Nitrux have formally announced Maui Shell and it sure does look pretty.</p>
<p>A desktop environment with an aim to scale and look good across a wide range of different devices including mobiles, tables and desktop computers. They said the aim is to have "no need for multiple versions targeting different form factors" and it's seriously slick. Worth noting at this point, it is far from finished with plenty of missing features. The developers have announced it to get some early testing and feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311224301641298213gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311224301641298213gol1.jpg"/></a>Click to enlarge. Maui Shell Desktop.</p>
<p>Built on top of KDE tech, it's comprised of two main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cask is the shell container and elements templates, such as panels, popups, cards, etc.</li>
<li>Zpace is the composer, which is the layout and places the windows or surfaces into the Cask container.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their current roadmap aims for a stable 1.0.0 release in September, followed by the next major version in December.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://nxos.org/maui/introducing-maui-shell/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and find it on <a href="https://github.com/Nitrux/maui-shell" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The latest release of Nitrux (v1.8.0) includes a preview of Maui Shell.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To begin 2022, let's take a fresh look at the current top 100 Steam games and see how well (or not) the run on Linux.</p>
<p>As part of a series we shall be doing, where we first took a proper look at this back in October 2021, including games that are both Native to Linux and Windows games that are run through the <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> compatibility layer. With help from <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> reports to investigate.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that while the top 5-10 games doesn't change too often on Steam, the rest do fluctuate quite a lot as it often depends on some of the bigger releases that appear. We are once again going by the numbers on SteamDB using their 24 hour peak-player count. Take this as your snapshot of how things are a month before the Steam Deck releases to see what you might expect to work or not.</p>
<p>Over time the compatibility is expected to increase thanks to native ports, more Windows-only games working with Steam Play Proton and now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/epic-games-announce-full-easy-anti-cheat-for-linux-including-wine-a-proton" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/battleye-confirms-linux-support-for-steam-deck-will-be-opt-in-like-easy-anti-cheat" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> have expanded their support.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">Proton GE</a> refers to the community-built version of Proton. So while it requires adding it manually (which takes all of 5 minutes), it still works. This is sometimes needed for games where videos don't work with the official Proton. Valve is working on getting them all working out of the box with official Proton.</li>
<li>Rocket League works but was removed from Steam for new players. However, it does work with Wine (which Proton is built from) if you use something like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> to get it from Epic.</li>
<li>Sea of Thieves voice comms don't work.</li>
<li>Phasmophobia just recently seemed to fix the voice comms with Proton.</li>
<li>We did not count Myth of Empires, as Steam delisted it due to ongoing <a href="https://www.mythofempires.com/news/2021/1207/86.html" target="_blank">legal troubles</a>.</li>
<li>F1 2021 had some fixes for AMD GPUs lately but still seem pretty problematic overall.</li>
<li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is Linux Native, but the latest DLC is Windows-only but that does work with Proton.</li>
<li>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition works but online multiplayer can desync unless you do a small fix.</li>
<li>Brawlhalla added EAC, which you can disable and they're trying to support Proton with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>With not long to go until the Steam Deck releases, hopefully Valve still have a few releases of Proton to improve things further. Anti-Cheat continues to be the biggest hurdle for Linux gaming and the Steam Deck. We've not seen many titles at all enable it officially, with the current list being quite small. We do expect that to change if the Steam Deck is a success though, and we fully expect it to be - as long as Valve can get enough units produced.</p>
<p>A few false-flags have appeared over the last few months like Rainbox Six Siege suddenly working, however do remember that until Valve or the developer actually confirm it, they will likely (and it did) stop working due to the anti-cheat.</p>
<p>Personally, I've not been able to get DayZ to work myself (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/more-battleye-titles-for-proton-on-linux-including-dayz-arma-3-now-supported/" target="_blank">now it's supported</a>) but I know plenty of others have. Even with the suggested fixes, I just get a black screen, which is a shame. In some ways Proton is still a bit of a minefield like that, hopefully a solution will be found.</p>
<p>The most important part — the numbers: we're currently seeing around <strong>76% of the top 100</strong> (based on peak player counts) as of January 2022 working on Linux with Native Linux games and Windows games in Proton taken together. So, things are looking pretty good ahead of the Steam Deck launch since it will use SteamOS 3 which is based on Arch Linux.</p>

      <title>Steam hit a new all-time user count close to 28M to start 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems there continues to be no stopping Steam's growth, with it only just recently hitting a brand new all-time high for concurrent users online.</p>
<p>The new high recorded by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> on January 2 was 27,942,036 so it's getting real close to hitting another massive milestone. A number we expect to be beaten again later this year, especially with the Steam Deck beginning to roll out during February and continuing throughout the year. When the new high was hit, Steam saw 8,219,950 gamers actually playing something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6891639981641289823gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6891639981641289823gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The top most played games on Steam doesn't really change much and certainly wasn't different during this time, with the usual suspects there including:</p>
<ul>
<li>CS:GO</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>

      <title>Keyboard and mouse mapping to gamepad tool AntiMicroX v3.2.1 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AntiMicroX is a great open source app that helps you map your keyboard and mouse to gamepad inputs. It's the continuation of the original AntiMicro project, which was abandoned. Very useful for games that have spotty or no gamepad support, and there's a number of other uses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21120152631641289422gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21120152631641289422gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Version 3.2.1 just went up with these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add note about available update (enabled in Windows)</li>
<li>Add database of SDL gamepad mappings (more gamepads will be enabled by default)</li>
<li>Add proper printing information about connected devices to logs</li>
<li>Apply proper theme to Windows version of app</li>
<li>Add handling SIGABRT (with printing stack)</li>
<li>Set theme for Windows</li>
<li>Bump QT version used in Windows Release to 5.15</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It also comes with a few bug fixes and general improvements, like a mention of a lack of AutoProfiles for Wayland users. While it might not be a huge release, it's certainly a good project to reminder readers of that's incredibly useful. The new inclusion of the SDL gamepad mappings is great though, should make it even better to work with.</p>
<p>Available from <a href="https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>Trouble in Solus Linux land as their Experience Lead quits</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Joshua Strobl, who was Experience Lead for the Solus Linux distribution, has officially quit but work on the Budgie desktop environment continues.</p>
<p>Announcing the departure on <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshStrobl/status/1477391260340137988" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Strobl linked to a longer <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/npG7ETU6" target="_blank">statement</a> that went over some rather <em>vague</em> issues that probably won't make much sense to anyone who isn't close to Strobl or the project. These include problems "which affect the ability to contribute to Solus, both from myself and others in the community".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11940601771641227180gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11940601771641227180gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The good news is the fancy Budgie desktop environment will live on as an independent project. Budgie now has a new home on <a href="https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, under the "Buddies of Budgie" organisation. Strobl mentioned the intention to invite developers from Ubuntu Budgie, Endeavour and more to contribute to it.</p>
<p>Solus itself will also <a href="http://twitter.com/SolusProject/status/1477500863434403844" target="_blank">continue on</a>, with it being mentioned that the hand-over between Strobl and others will be "graceful".</p>
<p>This isn't the first major blow for Solus, since they also had to deal with the original creator Ikey Doherty quitting a few years ago. Seems like there's some wider problems they need to deal with if they're to keep Solus going. Strobl also mentioned a plan to join up with Doherty on <a href="https://serpentos.com/" target="_blank">SerpentOS</a>.</p>

      <title>Not Actually A DOS Game looks like a retro delight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love retro games (or just retro-styled) and you're a fan of dungeon crawling? Check out the recent release of Not Actually A DOS Game for your latest fix.</p>
<p>Taking the visuals of classics like Rogue, it spices things up a bit to make the style a little more approachable with a slightly more modern interface and some small effects. The result is a game that should appeal to classic roguelike fans while giving some nice quality-of-life adjustments like tooltips, stat comparisons and more. Overall it certainly seems like a solid entry.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DUkfEiwCugc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f5f82acb2d267181aa2b10dc8f06ff5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DUkfEiwCugc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A core of classic roguelike gameplay. Descend the dungeon, collect items and kill monsters and bosses.</li>
<li>Kill enemies or explore the dungeon to gain floor progress.  Filling up the progress meter spawns a portal to the next floor.</li>
<li>37 pieces of equipment for 13 equipment slots with tooltips and stat comparisons.</li>
<li>11 Spells with multiple combo chains, gained through leveling and new equipment.</li>
<li>Discover campfires in the dungeon to cook higher quality foods and upgrade stats.</li>
<li>3 dungeon tile sets.  Forest, Desert and Tundra.</li>
<li>A graveyard which grows as the number of your deaths do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://hueson.itch.io/not-actually-a-dos-game" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.0.0 brings a much improved login system for Epic Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ending 2021 with quite the bang, the unofficial Epic Games Store app Heroic Games Launcher put up a big new release improving lots of features.</p>
<p>One of the major annoyances previously was the login system, that used an external browser and needed some copy / pasting to actually get in. That's been replaced with a new system that directly interfaces with the Epic Store making it much simpler to get going. There's also a new design for the app, with it using a sidebar instead of a navbar along the top which does look quite a bit nicer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15547564111641215086gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15547564111641215086gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3146428901641215087gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3146428901641215087gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Store will auto-login if you use the new login system (won't do it if you already logged in on Heroic. Also, if you want to log out from Heroic, log out of the Store first, otherwise Heroic will log in again using your credentials on the store since both pages use the same cookies.</li>
<li>Changed how games are installed. Now both the Game page and the game card will open the same Installation Dialog with the path to choose where to install or a button to import a game.</li>
<li>Unreal marketplace is hidden by default now, there is a toggle in the settings to show it. (don't do that if you have a big selection of assets, right now Heroic freezes if you have 2000 assets or more, if this happens, edit the config file manually and set the option to false then restart Heroic.</li>
<li>Game Logs now will contain system information (hardware, SO, etc) and the game settings.</li>
<li>Added buttons to Clear Heroic Cache and Reset Heroic completely.</li>
<li>Adds Estonian, Finnish, Bulgarian and Farsi languages.</li>
<li>[MacOSX] Support for Native games installation. With a new platform filter.</li>
<li>[Windows] Support for Game Shortcuts</li>
<li>[Linux] Added Wine prefix selection on game install</li>
<li>Improved accessibility to navigate the interface with only a keyboard</li>
<li>Legendary updated to v0.20.22</li>
<li>Several refactors, improvements, and optimizations lead Heroic to consume fewer resources like CPU and RAM. On Linux, Heroic consumes around 100MB or ram while on Windows it uses around 200MB.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download from the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>According to the main developer on <a href="https://twitter.com/flaviofearn/status/1476951148728832010" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, getting Flatpak supported for Heroic installs is planned.</p>

      <title>Canonical hiring a Desktop Gaming Product Manager for Ubuntu Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems Canonical, creator of Ubuntu, is finally looking to get serious and improve Ubuntu gaming with a new Desktop Gaming Product Manager job waiting to pull someone in.</p>
<p>Currently, Ubuntu is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/steam-ended-2021-with-a-slightly-lower-linux-user-share-ending-the-recent-growth/" target="_blank">still the most popular</a> Linux distribution on Steam, but the likes of Manjaro have been closing the gap so perhaps with moves like this Canonical can keep Ubuntu on top. It certainly needs the push, as more and more people are recommending new users install something else, such as Pop!_OS. Even Valve have moved away from a Debian base for SteamOS 3 with it being based on Arch Linux. Indeed, their Partner documentation <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/testing#3" target="_blank">suggests Manjaro for developers who don't have access to a SteamDeck dev-kit</a> (although Ubuntu <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/platforms/linux" target="_blank">remains their recommendation</a> for native Linux development outside of the SteamDeck).</p>
<p>According to the job advert, Canonical want to "make Ubuntu the best Linux desktop for gaming" and they "work with partners in the silicon world to ensure the latest graphics drivers and tweaks are built-in for optimal frame rates and latency, as well as with partners in the gaming industry to ensure that mechanisms such as anti-cheat capabilities are available to ensure fairness and product availability".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This role leads the product and go-to-market for gaming on Ubuntu Desktop. You will define product strategy as well as drive engagement and adoption. The role requires an analytical storyteller with a strong sense of message and a deep understanding of Linux graphics, gaming, and desktop technologies and communities. We prefer university-graduated professionals with software engineering and software engineering management experience who want to become business executives and entrepreneurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key points of the job include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead desktop graphics choices in Ubuntu</li>
<li>Drive partnerships in the graphics silicon, desktop, and gaming spheres</li>
<li>Tell the story of Ubuntu for gamers</li>
<li>Lead engineering design and development</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a work from home job, so if you think you have what it takes, take a look at the <a href="https://canonical.com/careers/3776036" target="_blank">job listing</a>.</p>
<p>While you're here, what do you think Ubuntu can improve to make Linux gaming better? Let us know in the comments. Maybe a potential candidate will get some ideas.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 27.2 enters Beta with official Flatpak support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for 2022, the OBS team is preparing a major new release of the free and open source livestreaming and recording software OBS Studio.</p>
<p>OBS Studio 27.2 has two Beta versions out bringing in some major new features. For Linux users, it's a big one too as it brings along our previously reported plans for official Flatpak support. This means users of any Linux distribution will be able to grab the officially supported package with all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added AJA source for AJA devices [DDRBoxman/AJA Team]</li>
<li>Added AJA output to tools menu for AJA devices [DDRBoxman/AJA Team]</li>
<li>Added the ability to set different blend modes to sources via the source right-click context menu (similar to Photoshop’s layer blending for example) [jw0z96]</li>
<li>Added AOM AV1 and SVT-AV1 encoders (note that these are currently considered experimental, work best with CPUs that have many cores, and are only accessible for recording in advanced output mode) [Jim]</li>
<li>Added an OBS hotkey for browser sources to allow refreshing a browser source via that hotkey [gxalpha]</li>
<li>Added hotkey filter search [furious]</li>
<li>Added hotkey duplicate detection [furious/Jim]</li>
<li>Added a warning dialog when switching profiles that have settings changes that require a restart [offthegrid-mike]</li>
<li>Added a “Show active outputs warning on exit” option in advanced settings, which allows you to enable/disable the confirmation dialog on exit while recording/streaming [bobvandevijver]</li>
<li>Added support for the RIST protocol [pkv]</li>
<li>Added official Flatpak support for Linux [GeorgesStavracas]</li>
<li>Added framework for future support of background hotkeys on Wayland [kkartaltepe]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plenty of other smaller tweaks came with it like an upgrade to the CEF version used, the Window Capture on Linux is now sorted alphabetically, Twitch panels match the OBS theme for dark / light mode and more robust PipeWire Capture support for Linux.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and test from their Flatpak using these commands:</p>
<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo</code><br/>
<code>flatpak install flathub-beta com.obsproject.Studio</code></p>
<p>Once it's out of Beta, installing will be easier as it will be on the main branch.</p>

      <title>Steam ended 2021 with a slightly lower Linux user share ending the recent growth</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After 7 months of seeing the Linux user share on Steam continue to grow, December saw 2021 end with it dropping slightly. The results can be seen on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, which shows some trends over time, taken from the official opt-in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware Survey</a>.</p>
<p>December 2021 saw the Linux user share at 1.11%.</p>
<p>Something we've seen a few times, is that when the number of Simplified Chinese language users rises on Steam, the Linux numbers drop and it appears to be what has happened once again this time. It's not always the case, as we have seen times where Linux has risen regardless but it is often the cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16650981811641213274gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16650981811641213274gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This year we do have the Steam Deck releasing, with the first batch of orders going live next month so we're very keen to see how this will affect the numbers. Hopefully they will be included in the survey, although it's possible Valve will separate them somehow.</p>
<p>According to Steam these are the most popular distributions with gamers on their platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS 64 bit 17.90% +1.48%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 11.96% -0.98%</li>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 11.42% -0.69%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.2 64 bit 7.50% +0.46%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 21.10 64 bit 6.31% +0.89%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 21.04 64 bit 5.54% -1.77%</li>
<li>Other 39.38% +9.31%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Orontes Games creator of DRAG gets acquired by iRacing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/773840/DRAG/" target="_blank">DRAG</a> from Orontes Games has been noticed as something special as iRacing has acquired the team.</p>
<p>Lead developers Christian Folkers and Thorsten Folkers have officially joined the iRacing team, and the <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-acquires-orontes-games-developer-of-racing-game-drag-and-proprietary-game-engine/" target="_blank">statement</a> makes it clear that DRAG will continue to be developed. Not only that, the Folkers will also be developing additional games and bring their expertise and proprietary tech to iRacing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16739437781641212798gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16739437781641212798gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We have been on the lookout for opportunities to strategically expand our capabilities and reach. With the release of DRAG, we saw a team with tremendous potential to help. From our first conversations we have been extremely impressed with Christian and Thorsten”, said Tony Gardner, president of iRacing. “They are extremely creative and highly skilled developers, and we are excited to have them join our talented team here at iRacing. Their addition will allow us to further enhance iRacing and position us to potentially expand our offerings in the future.”</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to be joining iRacing – the proven leader in the simulated racing space”, added Christian Folkers. “iRacing and Orontes Games share many of the same development philosophies so this is a natural fit for both of us. We remain passionate about DRAG and plan to continue development and we look forward to working with the entire iRacing team as we push the company to the next level.” </p>
<p>Hopefully this means we will see some more exciting improvements to DRAG this year, which was one of the most promising racers we saw in 2020.</p>

      <title>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's that time of the year again. 2021 is nearly over after what feels like the longest year ever so let's all hope for a better 2022 shall we? COVID-19 sadly continues being a big issue worldwide, so we hope you're all staying safe.</p>
<p>For Linux gaming, it was quite a year with so many announcements it's been hard to keep track of it all. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/valve-has-formally-announced-the-steam-deck-a-portable-handheld-console-with-steamos/" target="_blank">Steam Deck announcement</a> being the biggest thing to happen this year of course, followed by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/epic-games-announce-full-easy-anti-cheat-for-linux-including-wine-a-proton/" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/battleye-confirms-linux-support-for-steam-deck-will-be-opt-in-like-easy-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> updates that were quite exciting. A couple of other favourites from this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/7-months-of-linux-rising-on-steam-5-months-above-1-percent/" target="_blank">November marked 7 months of Linux rising on Steam &amp; 5 months above 1%</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/linux-foundation-launches-the-open-3d-engine-based-upon-amazon-lumberyard/" target="_blank">Linux Foundation launches the Open 3D Engine based upon Amazon Lumberyard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/dxvk-native-gets-an-official-release-to-help-linux-ports-with-vulkan/" target="_blank">DXVK Native gets an official release to help Linux ports with Vulkan</a> (see also: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/an-interview-with-joshua-ashton-developer-on-the-likes-of-dxvk-vkd3d-proton-and-more/" target="_blank">our interview with Josh</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For 2022, things are going to be both exciting and scary for Linux gaming. So much hinges on how the Steam Deck launch goes and if it will be a success or not. We're still a few months away yet and no doubt Valve have plenty more upgrades for Steam and Proton up their sleeves. We've no idea when we will be able to do our own direct Steam Deck coverage, as after the delay our reservation is currently sat on Q2 2022.</p>
<p>We'll be taking our usual end of year holiday break so expect us to be pretty quiet for the next <em>week</em> or so. Time to put our own feet up, grab a controller and catch up on some gaming. We may be doing some livestreams though, so be sure to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow us on Twitch</a> and keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our Twitter</a> for announcements!</p>
<p>If you need help with Linux and / or gaming - remember to hop on over to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/" target="_blank">our Forum</a>, as answered posts get picked up by the mighty search engines whereas they don't for other popular real-time chat areas. Although we do have plenty of other places to hangout and chat to other Linux gamers like <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/linux_gaming" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gamingonlinux-community:matrix.org" target="_blank">Matrix</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/irc/" target="_blank">IRC</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>big</strong> big thank you to all readers, supporters and helpers over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Peace and Love.</strong></p>
