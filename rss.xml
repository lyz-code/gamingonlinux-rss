      <title>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the COSMIC Desktop Environment is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have today finally released Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the newly launched COSMIC Desktop Environment. Giving the team at System76 their own foundation to build upon and help make their hardware more tailored and unique, it will be interesting to see the wider reception for the COSMIC desktop.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not expecting perfection from the first proper release of COSMIC, but from the time I've spent playing around with it - I am quite impressed with what they've done. The way everything flows is quite nice. Although, I really don't like the big thick borders by default.</p>

      <title>Kitten Space Agency is the spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitten Space Agency is an in-development spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program from RocketWerkz that you can try right now for free.</p>
<p>It's using a crowdfunding model to pull in supporters via <a href="https://ahwoo.com/store/KPbAA1Au/kitten-space-agency" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ahwoo</a>, which allows you to try the game completely free without paying a penny and it's your choice to donate after if you feel it's worth it. With what happened to Kerbal Space Program 2 where we still don't entirely know what's going on but the game is basically dead, another developer picking up the torch seems like an interesting idea for fans of the original.</p>
<p>More about it: Kitten Space Agency is a space-flight game that turns real aerospace concepts into something you can learn, test, and explore. Built in Auckland, New Zealand by RocketWerkz, the project aims to inspire future explorers while giving players deep control over engineering, mission planning, and flight execution. KSA is powered by RocketWerkz's new BRUTAL development framework, designed to enable moddability, high performance, and long-term scalability. </p>
<p>A popular idea it seems even this early-on, with the developer recently announcing their campaign has crossed over $100K in funding from people. The project is led by DayZ and ICARUS creator Dean Hall, joined by Felipe Falanghe (HarvestR), original creator of Kerbal Space Program, and Stefan Moluf, former SpaceX flight software engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15911984681765477268gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15911984681765477268gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>"The support for Kitten Space Agency has been incredibly encouraging. We set out to try a more open way of building games and it’s clear people want to be part of that mission. Contributions through Ahwoo help us keep developing the project, but so does playing our other games like Stationeers or Icarus which help fund the work behind Kitten Space Agency. However people choose to support us, we’re grateful. It all helps us keep pushing this mission forward."  — Dean Hall, CEO of RocketWerkz.</p>
<p>The game in the current development build appears to work on Linux. I tested it adding the installer directly into Steam, and setting it to use Proton Experimental and it loaded without an issue.</p>
<p>One to keep an eye on if you love your simulation games.</p>

      <title>The huge Project Zomboid build 42 finally gets multiplayer just in time for the holidays</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow - that sure took a while! A year since the first part of build 42 released and just in time for the holidays, Project Zomboid build 42 finally goes online. You'll now be able to play with friends, or others online but the developers recommend only playing on whitelisted servers or in Steam co-op. However, the build is labelled as "unstable" still, you need to opt into the Beta for it.</p>
<p>The list of what has changed for build 42.13.0 that includes multiplayer is long, <a href="https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/88501-build-42130-unstable-multiplayer-released/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">really long</a>. That's not taking into account all the main features added for build 42 originally (which at this point is years in the making) that was basically more of everything and huge improvements across every part of the survival game. <em>Saves made before 42.13.0 are also not compatible.</em></p>
<p>Here's their little celebration video for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lYKS02PYF7E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4933dbfd4c5109e0735c6c00dfa71b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lYKS02PYF7E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the Linux side, Project Zomboid will do native Wayland support now too if available. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The Linux version will use Wayland if available and the -Dzomboid.wayland=1 JVM option is used.<br/>
  -- This required moving keyboard initialisation until after window creation, only when Wayland is used.<br/>
  -- Known issues: While testing Wayland, it does not seem to be enabled by default on Linux using Wayland. It is also not possible to enable it through any Steam commands, since the “Dzomboid” flag is only a jvm command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This build is Steam-only for now, they will put it up on GOG when it's ready.</p>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder with huge battles Songs of Syx gets a major upgrade with a focus on war</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rated Overwhelmingly Positive from users on Steam, war is the focus of a major upgrade that just arrived for fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx.</p>
<p>What actually is it? Taking inspiration from the likes of Rome: Total War, Caesar, and RimWorld with the solo developer aiming to create the most ambitious city state sim ever. You start off with nothing and build up from a tiny village into a huge sprawling city and eventually a whole empire.</p>
<p>Version 70 is quite the game-changing upgrade for the battles in the game with the introduction of spearmen and cavalry, and the AI has been improved to be a fair bit smarter too so a little more planning is going to be needed. The scale of this one is seriously impressive!</p>
<p>They also have a brand new trailer to accompany the release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ci4_cFT7yaQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bee9eef018bb80849e7a3f05b692de3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ci4_cFT7yaQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And additionally the developer update video to go over it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yHI0BqHv0Hc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c1e8bcc886ffe597455d230d423f0d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yHI0BqHv0Hc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main update highlights condensed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New quick battle mode.</li>
<li>New unit cards, tooltips and QoL for divisions.</li>
<li>Division flags.</li>
<li>Improved AI tactics, and division maneuvering.</li>
<li>Remade combat mechanics and stats (New battle engine).</li>
<li>Cavalry (livestock equip). Increases mass, offence skill, decreases defense skill.</li>
<li>Spears. Increases formation defence (defence gained in the front of on guard divisions).</li>
<li>Visuals for all battle equips.</li>
<li>10 new soundtracks.</li>
<li>Advisor.</li>
<li>Resettle option (start over but keep level + resources).</li>
<li>Labs and libraries have non-recource options, enabled by default.</li>
<li>Limits on techs in tech tree.</li>
<li>All titles can be unlocked per race for more effect.</li>
<li>More efficient janitors.</li>
<li>Hunters effective for a bit longer, but diminishing returns per employee.</li>
<li>Autumn tree colors more prominent.</li>
<li>Lifebringer achievement fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed stalled invasions.</li>
<li>Fixed buggy caravans.</li>
<li>Region delivery of farmed goods fix.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dog merging roguelike deckbuilder Dogpile is out now and it&#39;s wonderful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dogpile was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/merge-dogs-to-make-bigger-dogs-in-the-roguelike-deckbuilder-dogpile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of my absolute favourites</a> during Steam Next Fest in October, and as a surprise it released yesterday. Note: the developer provided a key to GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>This is the first collaboration between the co-developers Studio Folly and Toot Games, the audio design team A Shell in the Pit, and the co-publishing team at WINGS. A deck-builder where you drop dogs on top of dogs and they'll merge into bigger dogs. It's pretty clever how they've merged elements of Suika Game bouncy physics, with elements of Balatro and deck-builders into something unique. I just love all the tiny little animations on the different dogs, really helps bring it to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888640981765473608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888640981765473608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You play dogs, get a little money when you combine them and keep progressing to customize them with special traits and figure out game-breaking combinations. It can get pretty funny with the different traits on the dogs, especially when things get a little bouncy with the physics system.</p>
<p>Check out the developer feature below that went with the surprise release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6KCfDtJt6ts"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97851314f510275b65d3e41ddc783e79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6KCfDtJt6ts" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game works great on Linux with Proton. Wonderful stuff and easily worth a purchase if you love your more chilled-out styled games. A lovely casual deck-builder.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG Winter Sale 2025</a> has arrived and with it absolutely loads of discounts if you prefer your games to be fully DRM-free and a classic has returned.</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds is set for some big performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a recent showcase video, Capcom revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds is set for multiple patches that should bring some decent performance boosts. </p>
<p>Performance seems to be a constant problem for the game, even on a high-end PC it has been full of issues. Perhaps these upgrades might even make it just a bit closer to playable on Steam Deck too. As shown in the Monster Hunter Showcase December 2025 showcase video, a screen capture of their plans is below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16373718431765463979gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16373718431765463979gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Title Update 4 is due out December 16, so it will be interesting to see just how far those listed upgrades will push the game. However, Title Update 4 is the "final large-scale update" for the game outside of a few technical patches they have planned as noted in the image above. So they'll be mostly moving onto other games.</p>
<p>All that and more in the video you can view below:</p>

      <title>Paradox have hopefully fixed the Vulkan performance in Crusader Kings III</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the release of the Crusader Kings III: All Under Heaven expansion and free update, the Linux and macOS versions were problematic but it should now be fixed.</p>
<p>There were many reports of it, and it seemed specifically to do with the Vulkan API and it affected Windows too. As of the latest update with version 1.18.2 released today, the issue should hopefully now be solved. Noted under the tech improvements part of the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We now support Apple Silicon CPUs natively (ARM architecture) and that should give a nice performance boost for people using M1/M2/M3/M4 chips.</li>
<li><strong>Graphical performance of Vulkan under Linux and Mac is brought back to roughly before-update levels.</strong></li>
<li>Map graphics shader performance has been fine tuned and improved, which will help out mid-range graphics cards the most.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A whole lot more came with this update too including three hit musical tracks from CK2 Jade Dragon for everyone, and various new features and various other bits of free content including: new events, special buildings, Steam Rich Presence for All Under Heaven features, UI improvements and so on.</p>
<p>It's a surprisingly big patch for the game. See all in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/594042189388972086" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Talking point - what have you been playing lately?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome back, dear readers, to another community article for us all to have a little chat about what we've been playing recently. It's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/talking-point-what-have-you-been-playing-lately/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">about a month</a> since we last did this, so it's time to see how you're all doing.</p>
<p>Last time I was completely hooked on ARC Raiders, clocking up a current total of 135 hours. I'm at a point where I feel like I've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer, and so I've taken a bit of a break from it for a while to see how it evolves across a few updates. Very enjoyable though, as long as you don't mind the PvP where you end up losing your good stuff constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4227499901765462380gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4227499901765462380gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823858711765462379gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9823858711765462379gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now that I've kicked the ARC habit, I've been jumping into a few other games including the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sektori-is-absolutely-one-of-the-best-modern-twin-stick-shooters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truly excellent Sektori</a>. Mixed in with some Overwatch 2 for the new season and winter events, because family members love it. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/overwatch-2-with-season-20-has-some-very-annoying-crash-bugs-on-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Despite a brief hiccup</a> with the latest season, it continues running great on Linux.</p>
<p>I also properly tried to get into Fallout 76 with the partner recently too, but something about it just feels a bit off. I can't quite put my finger on why. I think, perhaps, I just enjoyed Fallout 3 and New Vegas too much that it doesn't do it for me as an MMO? More time needed to see for sure. Am I really missing too much if I skip over F76?</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments - what have you been playing lately?</p>

      <title>Open source XR runtime Monado 25.1.0 released with expanded hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monado is an impressive open source XR runtime that aims to support a whole lot of hardware, with a focus on great Linux support and version 25.1.0 is out now. If you're a true XR enthusiast this is one for you to check out, as you might see some hardware you have working quite well with it.</p>
<p>What's new in this release? Quite a lot! Highlights courtesy of Collabora:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Hand-tracking enhancements</h4>
<p>This release introduces support for the XR_EXT_hand_tracking_data_source extension, enabling Monado to distinguish between unobstructed and conforming hand-tracking modes, an important step for better controller-aware tracking and more robust multi-source input. Alongside this work, several drivers were updated to leverage the new roles, and long-standing quirks in hand-pose selection and orientation were fixed.</p>
<h4>Asynchronous OpenXR calls</h4>
<p>Another major milestone is the introduction of Monado's xrt_future system and support for the XR_EXT_future extension. This new async plumbing code prepares Monado for the next generation of OpenXR features that rely on asynchronous operations.</p>
<h4>More device support</h4>
<p>Device support also expands significantly in this release with new drivers for the Blubur S1, Rift DK2, and SolarXR IPC, plus improvements for the Razer Hydra, Vive Pro 2, Xreal Air 2 Ultra, and Fujitsu headset. The compositor sees important enhancements as well, including per-scanline timewarp for rolling-scanout displays and more robust swapchain setup. On Android, users can now scan and store Cardboard calibration QR codes directly from the Monado main application page.</p>
<p>Overall, Monado 25.1.0 focuses on improving reliability, modernizing internal infrastructure, and broadening hardware compatibility. All these enhancements continue the project’s mission to make open XR technology more capable, flexible, and widely accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See more in the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/monado-25-1-0-enabling-tomorrows-openxr-experiences.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/releases/v25.1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>I'll admit I haven't actually tried anything with Monado yet, but from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamvr-2-13-brings-a-whole-lot-of-bug-fixes/?comment_id=285480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous comments</a> on GamingOnLinux, you could see a good experience with it. Hopefully Valve will continue to improve SteamVR directly on Linux too, especially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Steam Frame</a> that uses SteamOS.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR Redstone arrives with AMD FSR SDK 2.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD today properly revealed and released AMD FSR Redstone with the AMD FSR SDK 2.1, bringing many enhancements to their upscaling tech. Currently though, there's no direct support for Linux. Most likely, we'll have to wait and see how Valve's Proton / Wine can handle the new tech.</p>
<p>They're only officially supporting Windows 10 and Windows 11 with DirectX 12, that and the main highlight features are still just for AMD RDNA 4 (AMD Radeon RX 9000 series) but they do say there's "analytical fallback modes for select features support RDNA 3.5 architecture and earlier graphics". With this they're also doing a minor rebrand to cut down on all the long names so instead of things like "AMD FidelityFX" it's now just all going under the "AMD FSR" branding.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new for this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Frame Generation</strong> - an advanced frame-generating solution that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate high-quality intermediate frames from two consecutive source images, interpolating the motion of pixels between the start and end images. The neural approach significantly reduces artifacts common in analytical interpolation such as ghosting and motion discontinuities.</li>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Ray Regeneration</strong> - a standalone, machine learning-powered real-time denoiser that integrates seamlessly with any game engine, enabling high-quality visuals by denoising inputs from ray-traced workloads. Requiring AMD RDNA 4 architecture graphics, it works best when combined with other AMD FSR “Redstone” technologies to transforming noisy outputs from ray tracing into a clean, coherent image.</li>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Radiance Caching</strong> - a state-of-the-art illumination cache designed to work in tandem with Monte Carlo path tracing to boost rendering performance. At its core is an online machine learning model that continuously trains on complex, multi-bounce global illumination (GI) on-device and in real-time. The result is richer, more immersive lighting environments that respond dynamically without the need for pre-computation or baking.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Factorio mod developer and Hooded Horse reveal new automation game Substructure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is going to be horrible for my free time. Substructure sounds like a real interesting entry into the factory building automation genre. Coming from the developer of the popular Factorio mod Ultracube, now going by Dubious Design and publisher Hooded Horse. With vertical layers, it's set to add some interesting design choices.</p>
<p>More about it: "Set on a rogue planet that appears at the far reaches of the solar system, players will be tasked with leading an expedition to uncover the mysteries of this interstellar interloper. Establish complex automated factories and production chains on the lush surface of this alien world, all to support further exploration below the crust. Players can also work alone or with friends as they build around intricate caverns, and exploit alien resources hidden beneath the surface, driving the light of industrialization to the very depths. What mysteries will awaken and what dangerous threats will emerge remain to be seen…"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwV_0_25zh8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adde8c5946758e2d24190d48da6b0b60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwV_0_25zh8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Dubious Design is building something that goes far beyond the usual factory-builder,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “Between the vertical layers, intricate logistics, and day one support for modding and co-op, this will be the last factory game you’ll ever play.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be happier to (finally) announce we’re working with Hooded Horse,” says Dubious Design CEO Michael Donoghue. “It was clear from the outset that we had a shared passion for these types of experiences, and together we’ll be able to make Substructure truly great. We could not have hoped for a better partner.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Social stealth narrative game Better Than Us is all about creating a web of lies to steal from the ultra-rich</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><!-- squire -->A political social stealth narrative game about lying and stealing from the ultra-wealthy? Better Than Us certainly sounds like a game for the times. Sitting somewhere between a point and click adventure and a visual novel, it has a really great style to it.</p>
<p>Developed by Little Bat Games, who made the BAFTA-nominated Vampire Therapist it's going to feature an all-star voice cast to keep you hooked in. Here's a little more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->Set in the year 2200, Better Than Us depicts a (not entirely absurd) future directly inspired by humanity’s past and present. The wealthiest people in centuries have created floating cities to insulate themselves from a worldwide climate apocalypse of their own creation, not to own mansions and sports cars, but to buy moral authority itself. And surprise, surprise: extreme wealth doesn't afford anyone a greater sense of morality.</p>
<p><!-- squire -->They might have stolen our future, but in <strong><em>Better Than Us</em></strong> the spoils of past plundering and pillaging can be stolen from them. Players will take on the role of a master thief and manipulator (and her rodent pal), infiltrating exclusive parties thrown by the ultra-wealthy in their floating fortresses. Rather than stealth or violence, players will use charm and deception to develop key relationships with a cast of bizarre characters corrupted by their own wealth. They’ll need to remember which lies were told to which people, weaving an ever-growing web of deceit that even an all-powerful oligarchy will struggle to see through. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LVUF2QlTa04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f2235f8dca1a559be58c62330e39f759.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LVUF2QlTa04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Looking to the past is a helpful way of examining modern issues. Not only is the historical record inspiring, but dead people are less able to sue small game studios," said Cyrus Nemati, creative director at Little Bat Games. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell Lies, Remember Lies</strong> - It doesn't matter what you say. It matters that you remember what you said, and to whom. Track your deceptions or watch them collapse around you.</li>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Voice Acting -</strong><em> Better Than Us</em> will include an all-star cast led by Sarah Grayson (<em>Hades II, Vampire Therapist, Gone Home),</em> joined by Cyrus Nemati (<em>Hades II, Vampire Therapist, Duck Detective)</em> and more.</li>
<li><strong>Sneak Queen </strong>- Navigate lavish parties in an opulent post-apocalyptic world, sneak into places you don't belong, and steal what the wealthy value most: their stupid expensive crap.</li>
<li><strong>History Echoes Forward</strong> - Developed in consultation with historians from Oxford, UC Davis, and the University of Florida, Better Than Us is directly inspired by the consequences of extreme wealth inequality through the past and present.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer confirmed it will launch with support for Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 2025 fundraising has been a huge success</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Absolutely smashing their goals, the KDE team have managed to have a huge success for the <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2025 fundraiser</a> that's currently ongoing. 70% of KDE funding comes directly from users, so it's essential to help fund the free and open source software that you love.</p>
<p>The current total at time of writing has managed to hit a nice <strong>€272,256.5</strong>. Going by a <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/12/06/this-week-in-plasma-better-hardware-support/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from developer Nate Graham, a whole lot of it came directly from the KDE Plasma pop-up that they added to remind people to support development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donate to <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KDE’s 2025 fundraiser</a>! It really makes a big difference. Believe it or not, the fundraiser has topped €100,000! And that’s just for the fundraiser itself; the yearly donation pop-up has also raised another €100k in just the past five days (!!!).</p>
<p>It’s kind of amazing. This money will help keep KDE strong and independent for years to come, and I’m just in awe of the generosity of the KDE community and userbase. Thank you all for helping KDE to grow and prosper!</p>
<p>If money is tight, you can help KDE by directly <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">getting involved</a>. Donating time is actually more impactful than donating money. Each contributor makes a huge difference in KDE — you are not a number or a cog in a machine! You don’t have to be a programmer, either; many other opportunities exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see this. I hope that 2026 will see KDE and the Plasma desktop continue to reach new heights. And with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a> launching next year with SteamOS Linux and the Plasma desktop mode - it's going to be a great year for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>I donated to KDE this year, did you?</p>

      <title>Get ready for another adventure with The Darkside Detective: Backside of the Moon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The lovely Darkside Detective series is set to expand with a new announcement of The Darkside Detective: Backside of the Moon. Coming from Irish developer Spooky Doorway and published by Akupara Games, there's no release date for it yet but most likely next year.</p>
<p>It was shown off during the 2025 Unity Awards Showcase earlier this month. Here's a bit more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detective McQueen and Officer Dooley are back from their sabbatical, and although they miss their midday mimosas and suntanning on the beach, crime never sleeps, and neither does McQueen (we’re prescribing him Melatonin, god help us it works).</p>
<p>Follow six never before seen cases, where our dream(y) team is back and more ready than ever to put the zing in Van Helsing although… this time around, there are no vampire stories... that we know of. Still, our heroes swore a vow to serve and protect so they will explore, gather, combine, point AND click their way through whatever comes their way. Keep an eye out for werewolves, cursed items, rituals, treasure hunts, and perhaps the most terrifying monster of all - rich people!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don't know yet if it will have Native Linux support but their previous games did. If not, there's Proton to run it on Linux.</p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 with Season 20 has some very annoying crash-bugs on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 10/12/25 08:42 AM UTC - Blizzard actually fixed it directly in the game. Really great to see actual direct support like this. From the Overwatch <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/proton-support-is-broken-game-crashes-on-esc-chats-etc/992546/79" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> from developer Bee:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Hi all, apologies for this issue. We have released a patch that we believe resolves this crash. Thanks!" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2732921411765356111gol1.jpg"/></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Overwatch 2 has launched the big Season 20 update but unfortunately for Linux / SteamOS fans, it comes with some really annoying crash bugs.</p>
<p>Such is the way with live-service type games, where Linux clearly isn't a tested platform before updates are rolled out. Something that may cause issues over time with Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new upcoming Steam Machine</a>. However, as long as you <em>don't</em> do a few things you should be okay. The issue is that certain menu interactions will just completely crash the game. We'll have to wait for Valve developers to get a fix into Proton for the game to work properly again.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the bug report on Valve's Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7033#issuecomment-3634156013" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> the game will crash and quit if you do any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the chat and close it or press enter with it open (confirmed myself).</li>
<li>Clicking on a prestige tier in the new battle pass (confirmed myself).</li>
<li>Potentially pressing ESC during a match (didn't happen for me).</li>
<li>Clicking around in the Missions section of the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, stay off the chat entirely during matches and you should still be able to play. As annoying as that may be. I've played quite a few rounds and it will reliably crash if you try to interact with the chat box. There's also posts on the Steam forum about it crashing on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2357570/discussions/0/689743495770993552/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Linux PCs</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2357570/discussions/0/689743495770990967/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uN5FMv69Sas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/795f0f26fdf46d0bd51c986851ee6203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uN5FMv69Sas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully we'll see a fix soon!</p>

<p>Creative Assembly recently held their 25th Anniversary Showcase for the Total War series, with Total War: MEDIEVAL III being announced. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/four-total-war-classics-join-gog-in-their-preservation-program-with-more-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG also recently expanded their Preservation Program</a> with some classic Total War titles and more are coming to GOG too.</p>
<p>As for Total War: MEDIEVAL III, it's quite some time away as it's only in the "opening stages" and sounds like it's going to be a <em>big</em> thing for Creative Assembly as a developer. Their full announcement on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been waiting a long time to say this: Total War is going back to the medieval era.</p>
<p>We’re in the opening stages of Total War: MEDIEVAL III’s development – pre-production, to be precise, meaning we’re still years from release. But this isn’t just another game for us, it’s the realisation of something we’ve dreamed about for almost 20 years. The Medieval series is one of the most cherished chapters in Total War’s history, and creating a true successor is a goal we’ve held close for a long time. Now, we finally have the chance to make it happen.</p>
<p>This next chapter will be both a tribute to its predecessors and a bold revolution for what historical Total War can be. The team’s vision is clear: to create the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox featuring our signature blend of grand strategy and tactical real-time battles. A game that lets you shape your realms, rewrite history, and immerse yourself in the drama and intrigue of the Middle Ages like never before.</p>
<p>Some of you might be asking why we’ve revealed it this early, and the answer is quite simple: we want you to come on this development journey with us. At certain points throughout the year, we’ll share behind-the-scenes insights and give you a closer look at how the game is taking shape, so you can see it evolve with us – and in some cases influence its direction.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a sequel; it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of this, they're also completely overhauling their game engine "Warcore". They said it is the most advanced game engine in the history of the franchise that will empower their developers "with powerful tools to make gameplay more immersive, dynamic, and responsive than ever before". They said this new game engine also opens up the possibility for console releases too, so hopefully this means some big gamepad improvements for future titles on PC as well (which could be great for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's new Steam Machine</a>).</p>

<p>While Feral Interactive have previously done Native Linux ports of their games, it's far too early to tell if they will continue to do so, as Feral seem to be mostly out of doing Linux ports now. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/total-war-pharaoh-announced-linux-port-from-feral-interactive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back when Total War: PHARAOH was announced</a>, Creative Assembly incorrectly listed Feral as doing a Linux port with Feral later confirming it was only doing macOS for it. I'm going to presume you'll need Proton to continue playing the Total War series on Linux at this point, especially if you want cross-platform multiplayer.</p>

      <title>War Thunder is getting infantry combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no, it's going to pull me back in isn't it? War Thunder is finally adding infantry combat to its roster of war games in a future update. Testing is due to begin this month, being spread across stages for an eventual full roll-out during next year as the mode is still under development.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they're taking some elements from another game they publish called Enlisted, with you controlling a squad. They said you control a single soldier, but you have "full tactical control over the entire squad" and they will automatically follow you and assist in all combat situations.</p>
<p>It will come with a new location that mixes infantry, ground vehicles and aircraft set in Eastern Europe. During the closed beta there will only be a Domination mode, with soldiers and vehicles battling for control over a few specific points. There will also be specific set squads to pick during the beta. </p>

<p>They said the beta will be supported across "Windows, Linux and Mac, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles".</p>

      <title>Classic roguelike top-down shooter Nuclear Throne major update 100 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A lovely blast from the past of 2015, Nuclear Throne from the revived Vlambeer has update #100 out now with some major additions and improvements. Originally founded by Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman, nowadays Nijman owns 100% of the company after Ismail sold their part in it back in 2024.</p>
<p>Going back 10 years ago, Nuclear Throne was easily one of the most popular games in its genre. To this day, it's easily still one of the best too. Valve have also now given it a re-test and they've given it the green tick of Steam Deck Verified approval. It does have a Native Linux version, but Valve set it to use Proton 10.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11870694471765280170gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11870694471765280170gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights of it include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A thirteenth character: <strong>Cuz </strong>is not afraid to show his emotions, with a Cry ability that tears through enemies and projectiles alike. Oh, and he gets to carry 3 (three) weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Custom mode,</strong> allowing you to modify Nuclear Throne to your liking, create unique runs and challenges, and to get to know the game better than ever before.</li>
<li>New unlockable <strong>C-skins</strong> for every character (and new achievements for these).</li>
<li>Localization for <strong>15 languages</strong>: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, BR Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Turkish, &amp; Dutch. Tell your friends around the world!</li>
<li>The game now supports up to <strong>4 player local co-op</strong>.</li>
<li>Co-op reviving has been reworked and now works with Revive Chests.</li>
<li>Co-op Ultra Mutations have been slightly changed to work with 2-4 characters.</li>
<li>Reworked and re-organized the settings menu.</li>
<li>The game now runs at <strong>60+ fps</strong> (but 30 is still supported for the true believers).</li>
<li><strong>Widescreen</strong> support.</li>
<li>New side art and a new cursor.</li>
<li>Open Mind has been buffed a little.</li>
<li>Mutations and weapons in the HUD now show information on hover.</li>
<li>The GO button in the menu has been replaced with a cool little icon. This was done <s>to save money on localization</s> so that we could fit Cuz in!</li>
<li>We are now Steam Deck™ Verified.</li>
<li>Updates Mac build to run on 64-bit devices including Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Gamepads should work better, especially on computers with a bunch of them connected.</li>
<li>Community leaderboards site <a class="Focusable Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthronebutt.com%2Fdaily" target="_blank">Thronebutt</a> has gotten a beautiful overhaul!</li>
<li>Many more little fixes and quality of life changes that you might already know from the beta branch. Full changelog can be found <a class="Focusable Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYAL-Game-Tools%2Fbits-of-nuclear-throne%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FChangelog.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>We forgot to add any secrets. Sorry.</li>

      <title>Discord gets improvements for video on Linux PCs and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer team at Discord released a new engineering <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-december-8-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> yesterday (December 8th) detailing lots of fixes, along with some Linux improvements. As one of the most popular chat apps in the world, it's good to see their support of Linux continue to get better over time.</p>
<p>Scanning over the long multi-list of changes here's some improvements for us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue that caused Linux clients to display two titlebars.</li>
<li>Discord now supports hardware accelerated video encoding for AMD graphics cards on Linux through VAAPI, yielding almost twice the quality using less resources.</li>
<li>Go Live on Steamdeck is now faster with zero-copy encoding from Gamescope, making it possible to share the action with your friends without burning up your Steamdeck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest is mostly just a long separated list of bug fixes, along with an upgrade on Desktop to use Electron 37. Along with some other main highlights their team noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We've refactored our media upload client code with improved retry logic and added support for file upload resumption, so large uploads can continue if interrupted. The new retry logic is written in Rust and delivered significant latency improvements—around 15% overall, with mobile platforms seeing the biggest gains (21% faster on iOS, 10% faster on Android). </li>
<li>We’ve shipped a redesign of our Desktop User Settings. The goal of the redesign was to improve user’s ability to find what they’re looking for by improving the design language. Our metrics indicate this was successful, but please reach out if you have feedback.</li>
<li>We invested in some CDN configuration changes that dramatically improved video embed startup times. P90 latency improved 54% from 600ms to 275ms, and p95 latency improved 47% from 1,250ms to 658ms. This also fixed certain aberrant cases where videos could take as long as 40 seconds to play. Enjoy the consistent, speedy loads of video content.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Hytale will run on Linux PCs via Flatpak but Steam Deck will require more work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the first release of Hytale finally approaching, the developers are still working through getting it running on Linux and macOS. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/hytale-devs-confirm-they-are-working-to-bring-it-to-linux-and-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As covered on GamingOnLinux previously</a>, the developers did confirm they were working on both versions officially now.</p>
<p>At least now we know how you'll be getting it, with the developer doing it via a Flatpak which means you should be able to install it across many different distributions. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/1998020881499513243" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X/Twitter from Kevin Carstens, the Co-Founder and Tech Director for Hytale, they posted:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="RE: Mac &amp; Linux Support  We have finally removed the last library that was causing trouble for Mac and Linux support.  We are able to build for Linux now using flatpak. Mac builds are work in progress. There is more work on the CICD pipeline to host the files required for flatpak.  This is still NO CONFIRMATION for Linux / Mac support at launch but we are getting closer to that becoming a reality.  More in-depth testing remains, will keep updating as we move forward." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17979898501765278486gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And for those wanting to play it on Steam Deck, it may technically work since it will have a Linux version but may not feel very good right now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Thats a different story. Steamdeck may be technically possible but you still have the small screen size, gamepad controls and battery optimizations. We treat Steamdeck as a seperate platform in terms of development. We won't prevent you from installing it and trying but we need to do more work to really support it." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12592249441765278485gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's also no gamepad support at launch, but it's next up on the accessibility roadmap.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic becomes Team Fortress 2 Classified and arrives January 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer team EMINOMA have officially rebranded Team Fortress 2 Classic into Team Fortress 2 Classified, and they've set a release date for January 30th.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/team-fortress-2-classic-scrap-their-open-beta-and-new-valve-rules-likely-mean-they-have-to-change-the-name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in October</a> they had issues running a playtest demo that had to be scrapped due to technical stuff on Steam, and alluded to changing the name due to new rules from Valve. This was confirmed in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/512976676069574040" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> to announce the new Team Fortress 2 Classified name. Turns out sorting a new name when you're based on a Valve game is not a particularly easy or quick process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8399888661765276662gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thankfully, it's all sorted and should be out for everyone to play for free on January 30th.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>NEW-OLD FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode.</li>
<li>Use TF2 pre-release inspired weapons like the Nail Gun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.</li>
<li>Go on a rampage in Multi-Team maps, where GRN and YLW bring their unique (yet strangely identical) brand of violence to Arena, King of the Hill, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h4>NEW-NEW FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
<li>A chicken, or so we're led to believe.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's nice to see another company put their money where their mouth is. Lots of companies talk about openness and the like, but many don't bother to support all the projects they make use of. For Framework, it seems perfectly fitting for them to get on board with more open source with the nature of their modular open hardware.</p>

      <title>POSTAL: Bullet Paradise gets cancelled over generative AI with Goonswarm Games shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh dear. Goonswarm Games are shutting down after Running With Scissors cancelled POSTAL: Bullet Paradise due to the use of generative AI. <em>It's a bit of a saga this one.</em></p>
<p>I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/survivor-like-bullet-heavens-are-going-first-person-postal-with-postal-bullet-paradise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the initial announcement</a>, along with a follow-up update in there where Running With Scissors attempted to defend the developer. The backlash only continued, and eventually RWS cancelled it as per the statement GamingOnLinux was sent on December 5th via Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.</p>
<p>We’ve always been, and will always be, transparent with our community. Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don’t).</p>
<p>Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we’ve always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the POSTAL franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can’t wait to share more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a fresh follow-up statement on December 8th from Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following our statement on Friday, Running With Scissors would like to share an update. While we needed to cut ties with Goonswarm Games on Friday and state the reason for doing so, our broken trust, we still wanted to give Goonswarm the time and space to be transparent about what had occured.</p>
<p>After sharing <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a tweet</a> on Friday that got more than 8.5 million views which denied they had used generative A.I. and were closing the studio, on Saturday, Goonswarm Games issued a <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow-up tweet</a> acknowledging the use of generative A.I. and apologizing. We wish them all the best as we both move forward in our seperate ways.</p>
<p>Running With Scissors has always operated with an unwavering commitment to the truth and transparency. We look forward to continuing to support our fans and expand on the <em>POSTAL</em> universe played by millions.</p>

      <title>Netflix want to acquire Warner Bros. but they have to fight off Paramount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While I was off running around the woods for the weekend, Netflix announced their intention to acquire Warner Bros. but now Paramount want to fight.</p>
<p>In the original press release from <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Netflix</a> they said it will be for a total value of around $82.7 billion at $27.75 per WBD share. This deal would include its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO, and their game studios too. What it wouldn't include is WBD’s Global Networks division, which was due to be spun off into its own thing. The deal is not actually done, as it has to go through all the usual regulator approvals.</p>
<p>Another wonderful bit of consolidation isn't it? Well, perhaps, but not if Paramount get their way. As they've <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">launched</a> a rival bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. <em>including</em> the Global Networks segment. They're offering more too at $30.00 per share in cash which they said is "$18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration".</p>
<p>Interestingly, Paramount say they actually submitted six proposal over the course of 12 weeks but "WBD never engaged meaningfully" and so Paramount has "taken its offer directly to WBD shareholders and its Board of Directors to ensure they have the opportunity to pursue this clearly superior alternative".</p>
<p>Time to get your popcorn out.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-26 released with FEX included, improvements for DLSS and game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Here's everything that's new and improved for GE-Proton 10-26</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Proton:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fsr4 PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE Automatically download amdxcffx64.dll and upgrade games with FSR 3.1 to use FSR 4. Version to download can be specified by supplying it as a value, like so PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE="4.0.1", instead of 1. Downloads version 4.0.2 of the required DLL by default. This option also disables AMD Anti-Lag 2 currently due to various issues.</p>
<p>fsr4hud PROTON_FSR4_INDICATOR Enable the FSR4 watermark at the top left portion of the screen.</p>
<p>fsr4rdna3 PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE Identical to PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE but for RDNA3 GPUs. Enables some required compatibility options and downloads version 4.0.0 of the DLL by default.</p>
<p>fsr3 PROTON_FSR3_UPGRADE </p>
<p>dlss PROTON_DLSS_UPGRADE Automatically download and use newer versions of nvngx_dlss(d|g).dll DLLs.

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 49: One More to Go!</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-48-byzantine-labyrinthine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 48: Byzantine Labrythine</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Candy Cruncher</em> stands as an interesting piece of Linux gaming convergence, with it pulling on almost all of the major threads that defined the industry up to that point. The lead developer of the game was Brian Hook, who is best known for being one of the key architects behind the Glide API for 3dfx, but he would also find success working on both <em>Quake II</em> and <em>Quake III Arena</em> at id Software; founding Pyrogon was his attempt at a slower pace after being at the top of his field for so very long.</p>
<p>The Linux port was crafted by Ryan "icculus" Gordon, not long removed from his initial freelance work on <em>Serious Sam</em>, with the game also being one of the first titles to be picked up by Linux Game Publishing. Founded by retailer Michael Simms in 2001, LGP was an attempt to carry the torch dropped by Loki Software, and thus extend the shelf life of his Tux Games online store. So many people's hopes were tied up in this otherwise unassuming product, making it a shame it was but a mixed success.</p>
<p>Helping to set this tone early on is the CD-ROM, with the installer not having the right executable permissions set. To install the game you should instead download the candycruncher_new_installer.sh from the archived Linux Game Publishing website, as this will pull all of the relevant files off the disc as well as provide you with additional patches. A free <em>Candy Cruncher</em> demo can also be found through there, although for some reason it would never let me enter my name into the high score table.</p>
<p>The full version sidesteps this by just grabbing the name from your user account, but <em>Candy Cruncher</em> would still sometimes fail to initalize and then hang before reaching full screen mode. These hitches would prove to be sporadic for me however, with the port otherwise demonstrating itself to be solid. What bothered me more was how the demo lied to me by claiming you will get to choose your starting level; instead, you can choose from starting blocks of about four levels each capped at level 22.</p>
<p>This forces you to replay levels that you have already solved over and over, and only seems to be done as means to artificially increase the game's difficulty. Casual games can be challenging, but they should not be frustrating, and it feels like Brian Hook was not far enough removed from <em>Quake</em> to realize this. In fairness he was always hesitant about the implementation of a time limit, but the blaring alarms in the game are far from relaxing, even if you can turn the sound effect itself off in the options.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11853055291765272153gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11853055291765272153gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9309219731765272154gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9309219731765272154gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Candy Cruncher</em> is at its best then when you treat it like Solitaire; just something you can launch to kill a few idle minutes before inevitably finding yourself stuck with a bum hand. When playing from the starting stage I usually make it to about level 19 before becoming boxed in, although when I was playing the game more studiously with the level select I did manage to achieve a high score of 769019 after coming close to solving level 27, which is about as far into the game as I think I am going to get.</p>
<p>There are a purported fifteen different candy types in total, so I have yet to encounter all of them, but the only real difference is in their appearance and in the points awarded. What differentiates <em>Candy Cruncher</em> from similar match-three games, other than the obvious fact that you match six here, is that you do not actually move the candy pieces themselves. Instead, you drag about the blank space found on the board, and use that to nudge the candies into line.</p>
<p>Wrapping your head around this is critical to mastering the click and drag technique required to get through the higher levels. While the game does support both mouse and keyboard controls, <em>Candy Cruncher</em> is optimized to be played with the mouse, and for a very specific technique in particular involving holding down and dragging the cursor that the developers themselves admit to being unintuitive at first in the supporting documentation.</p>
<p>The only real way forward is through trial and error, with there being enough randomness to the board layouts to make solving a stage often become a coin toss. The main strategies involved are recognizing when you have enough candies of the same type to complete a line, and navigating around the dreaded black jelly beans, fixed pieces that cannot be matched and exist solely to block your columns or rows. Candy canes can break these, or be used to match with any other candy type.</p>
<p>What promised to be sweet often proved sour, but Pyrogon was able to release one more title, <em>NingPo MahJong</em>, through LGP for Linux before closing up shop in 2003. The next installment will be the 50th part in this series, and with this in mind, I needed to choose a game that was both big enough and historically important enough to warrant that distinction. To that end, I present to you a true Linux gaming milestone: what may very well be the first big boxed Linux game to ever hit retail store shelves.</p>
<p><strong>Carrying on in Part 50: Dawn of Civilization</strong></p>

      <title>Epic and Steam banned it but HORSES is out now on other stores</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Andrea Lucco Borlera / Santa Ragione, HORSES has proven to be a highly controversial title with both Epic Games and Steam banning its release. However GOG, Humble Store and itch.io have all decided to keep it. <em>Although, Humble Store briefly decided to stop the release they did actually put it up.</em></p>
<p>What actually is the game? Their explanation from the press details: "HORSES is a 3-hour first-person horror adventure set over fourteen days on a rural farm, where you work as a summer hand under a cryptic farmer and follow “a few rules” that unravel into increasingly surreal, unsettling tasks. As the sun sets and the facade of tranquility crumbles, you decide whether to keep to the safe path or venture into the farm’s hidden depths. The game blends interactive scenes with live-action intermissions, monochrome visuals, and silent-cinema title cards, with unique gameplay events each day. It's a game about the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility."</p>
<p>The situation with it is a quite confusing, and to explain it a fair bit the developer has put up a lengthy <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official statement</a> and FAQ. So far it seems both Valve and Epic Games have refused to actually clarify exactly why they have chosen to ban the game on their stores, making it all the more puzzling. Like many other games and media, it has some subjects in that some may find uncomfortable but there's plenty of games with <em>far</em> worse out there and live and Steam too.</p>
<p>The launch trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JYewjNYxV-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa72369cae1cf4bd50aadffd169a49bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JYewjNYxV-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is another case of issues with Steam keys too, as Santa Ragione say they were hoping to include their previous game Saturnalia in a game bundle. However, according to them, Valve have placed new rules on key requests too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam has recently begun refusing to grant developers keys for their own games. In the absence of clear rules or guidance, Valve led developers for years to believe they could request keys as needed, building communities and businesses outside Steam while still creating value for Steam users. It now withholds keys from indie developers who do not meet undisclosed sales thresholds. Our multiple requests for keys for our previous game, Saturnalia, were denied without any specific criteria we could work toward to resolve it. As a result, we have been unable to include the game in bundles we had planned to help recoup development costs for our next project, HORSES. This policy shift was never communicated and has been applied retroactively to existing titles. Developers and partners are understandably reluctant to speak publicly or challenge Steam, since as a de facto monopoly it holds disproportionate control over our business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not entirely clear what recent rule change they mean, as Valve publicly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3645136992388208760" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a> the rules way back in 2023 where you can see what changed via <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/bfa8ed111edc0ba6b963a0bb35f0c2de07d8cd58" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> to place certain limits.</p>
<p>Santa Ragione believe the removal from Epic Games and Steam, along with the above issue resulting in funding issues, may cause their studio to close. Hopefully it will find success on the other stores where HORSES is now available.</p>

      <title>Get some great Raw Fury games like Kathy Rain, Sable and more in a new Humble Bundle</title>

      <title>Guild Wars Reforged has arrived on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ArenaNet have released Guild Wars Reforged bringing together the Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns together along with various improvements. However the Guild Wars: Eye of the North expansion and the Bonus Mission Pack are still paid DLC.</p>
<p>Originally, they were aiming for it to be Steam Deck Verified, but that was quickly <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/29720/history/?changeid=U:70035202" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">removed</a> from the Steam description. It's rated Steam Deck Playable, but that seems mainly as Valve have yet to re-check it as the last test was back in 2022 for the game. So hopefully at some point Valve will retest it.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jXM-GkTvwnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43d92ac7176a72a093db0659b5d2c317.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jXM-GkTvwnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Stephen Clarke-Willson, the game director for Guild Wars, said, "The positive reception to the 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection reinforced our drive to keep this classic MMO thriving. As new players joined and experienced players rejoined the community, we discovered that people were playing on big-screen TVs and Steam Deck and other handheld devices, and so we decided to lean into supporting these playstyles fully with deep integration of controller support and big-screen TV support. Controller support has been a tough nut to crack for MMOs, and I think we dialed it in."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the original announcement of what's new and improved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New low, bundled price:</strong> <em>Guild Wars Reforged</em> brings Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall together for just £17.99. If you have purchased even one of the three campaigns, all of them will be unlocked through <em>Guild Wars Reforged</em>. And, of course, there are still no subscription fees.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware compatibility:</strong> <em>Guild Wars Reforged</em> is Steam Deck verified and has support for modern controllers. The UI has also been redesigned with larger text options, and the game has support for high DPI displays.</li>
<li><strong>Visual and audio updates:</strong> Dynamic sky bloom effects, new ambient occlusion, and lighting updates take better advantage of modern GPUs. Other visual touch-ups refine textures and make for a cleaner visual experience, while new positional audio support makes the world more immersive.</li>
<li><strong>User-friendliness:</strong> In addition to the updated UI that allows easier navigation, <em>Guild Wars Reforged</em> brings a new quest tracking system and an on-screen control guide.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless mouse is a great reasonably priced pick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I decided to upgrade my mouse from a cheap unbranded USB wired to the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless, so here's my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>I've gone through multiple from Razer, a few from VAXEE and various other random brands including at one point being a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/im-now-a-true-convert-after-using-a-vertical-mouse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vertical mouse convert</a>. The problem - my old mouse was starting to come apart. I seem to have this same issue with any mouse I buy. The thumb grip on it was loose, it looked cheap and it started creaking too. All very annoying, so I thought it was actually time for something just a little bit better.</p>
<p>Here's the thing — I've felt like I've been just massively spoilt by wireless tech. I use the Steam Deck for gaming often right in my hands, with no wires apart from when it needs some battery juice, and if I'm docking it or gaming at my Linux PC - I use an assortment of wireless controllers. I've always felt like with a USB wired mouse that at times I'm just fighting the wire, and considering just how many hours I'm sat using a mouse, it was time to cut the cord. This will also help with my permanent wrist injury with it being a bit more free for movement overall.</p>
<p>Logitech are generally a reasonably good brand, so after some searching I settled on the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless as it seemed to have a good price point between not cheap and not overly expensive either. It also seemed to be light enough even though it takes one full AA battery.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12467640971764847162gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've now been using it religiously for two and half weeks and their claim of 250 hours battery life so far seems to hold up quite well. That's with me using it every single day, often forgetting to turn it off with the switch on the bottom at night and so far - I've not needed to change the battery. So I am genuinely quite impressed there given the vast hours it's on and in constant use.</p>

<p>Thanks to the four solid pads on the bottom, it glides effortlessly over my mouse pad and really does feel nice to use. With a one-button click to change the DPI, by default you have a choice between 400, 800,1600 and 3200. For me 1600 is the sweet spot. Any concern with weight has gone too, even with the full sized AA battery inside there's no issues at all, I can barely feel it which is great for gaming on top of general work.</p>
<p>Noise level isn't too bad either. The left and right buttons do have a clear audible click to them, but not too loud that it's annoying. The scroll wheel is the real hero here though. Rolls nicely with your finger, with a clear bump at each level that makes things like quickly swapping weapons while gaming by scrolling effortless without accidental roll-overs.</p>
<p>As impressed as I am with it, there's <em>one</em> thing holding it back from true greatness. It's <em>too</em> smooth. Sure it looks good, and don't get me wrong it feels good. But it's just too slick, just a bit slippery perhaps even to hold. If it had a slight texture to the top and sides, holding it would pretty much be perfection.</p>
<p>When it comes to software, Logitech don't support Linux directly like a lot of vendors. But, open source to the rescue (as usual!). The <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Piper app</a> can detect it, and configure the DPI settings on the button quite nicely!</p>
<p>At £59.99 it's reasonably priced for what you get, but it's also quite often on sale (I snagged it for £27.99). <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07CGPZ3ZQ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a> has it right now for £34.99 or direct from <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/shop/p/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Logitech</a> for £29.99.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Chipmatic an upcoming mining and automation game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mining incremental inspired by Motherload, Dome Keeper and Super Mining Mechs with some added automation - Chipmatic looks like one to keep an eye on. There's a demo available on the Steam page so you can try it out early right now.</p>
<p>More about it: "Chipmatic is a factory building game where you control a mining robot on a mission to reach Earth’s core. Explore deep underground, research new tech and create the best (and only) factory on Earth! Can you discover what mysteries lie beneath the surface in this ruined planet some used to call home?"</p>
<p>Check out the demo trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6WF5Yt4wprM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34281d3345aeaf96a823ee33a4aa7b13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6WF5Yt4wprM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Go underground for coal, iron, and other useful minerals.</li>
<li>Refill your fuel manually, or by using your resources to create energy automatically.</li>
<li>Discover what happened to the beings who used to live here.</li>
<li>Power your base with coal, solar, or high-tech alternatives.</li>
<li>Smelt your ores into ingots, and refine them into complex and useful items.</li>
<li>Automate production chains to keep your systems running while you explore.</li>
<li>Improve your batteries, drill, jet-pack, and much more!</li>
<li>Build a laboratory and research all kinds of game-changing upgrades.</li>
<li>Turn yourself into the most advanced machine Earth has ever seen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going straight onto my wishlist. Could easily imagine myself spending hours digging and exploring in this one.</p>

      <title>Unreal Tournament 2004 is getting revived by OldUnreal with approval from Epic Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/epic-games-update-the-unreal-tournament-website-linking-to-the-free-downloads-from-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games did for the original Unreal Tournament</a>, they're giving full approval to <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 and keep it updated.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14432766771764843507gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Writing in the OldUnreal Discord, their team announced the upcoming revival of Unreal Tournament 2004. It will be available as a free download, with members of OldUnreal working to improve various parts of the game. Copied below is the original announcement from <a href="https://discord.gg/thURucxzs6" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! Some of you were probably wondering why we've been so quiet in the past couple of months. Today, we can finally reveal (part of) the answer: we've been working on a new side project!</p>
<p>With Epic's blessing and with the help of some new team members, we are bringing Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004) back. This means that we are going to publish an installer that downloads the original disc image for UT2004, installs the game, and applies patches to it. We are also going to start publishing patches that modernize the game, make it compatible with Windows Vista or later, Linux x86-64 and aarch64 (Raspberry Pi and similar), and Mac OS 10.9 or later, fix bugs, and implement quality-of-life changes.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. <strong>UT2004 will soon be available to download once again. Free of charge.</strong></p>
<p>This is a community-run effort but we’re excited to make the game easier to access and play again.</p>
<p>We have been working on this for quite some time now and have made enough progress to start inviting the first batch of testers. Highlights so far include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now natively support modern Linux and macOS systems with 64-bit Intel and ARM/Apple CPUs,</li>
<li>You can now play the game or run a server on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, albeit at a lower frame rate than on a PC!,</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions of the patch now include a fully functional UCC with an UnrealScript compiler (UCC make) and texture compression support,</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions now use SDL3 instead of SDL1,</li>
<li>D3D9Drv and fullscreen support are fully functional in the Windows 64-bit client,</li>
<li>We dealt our first (minor) blow to the editor goblin! We fixed several crash bugs, restored some broken functionality, and, most importantly, the editor will no longer freeze for several seconds when you click a viewport</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When can we expect it? Not for a little while. A public test version is planned "within the next two months" and they have some preliminary <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> up.</p>
<p>This is great. If you're not going to be doing anything with your classic games, you might as well let the community keep them alive. More companies should do this. Or, even better, just open source them - but one step at a time huh?</p>

      <title>The RAM price and availability situation is going to worsen as Micron pull their Crucial consumer business</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As RAM prices explode and availability becomes an issue thanks to AI companies, Micron announced their Crucial consumer business is no longer a thing.</p>
<p>Sent out in a <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> today Micron said they've decided to "exit the Crucial consumer business, including the sale of Crucial consumer-branded products at key retailers, e-tailers and distributors worldwide". Shipments will continue until the end of February 2026 - but after that, it's over as they will "continue to support the sale of Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial channel customers globally".</p>
<p>As for why? You probably guessed it - AI! From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,” said Sumit Sadana, EVP and Chief Business Officer at Micron Technology. “Thanks to a passionate community of consumers, the Crucial brand has become synonymous with technical leadership, quality and reliability of leading-edge memory and storage products. We would like to thank our millions of customers, hundreds of partners and all of the Micron team members who have supported the Crucial journey for the last 29 years.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucial did RAM and SSDs, so all of it will be going away from us lowly consumers.</p>

      <title>The response to s&amp;box from Facepunch going open source has been &#34;overwhelmingly positive&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open source rocks so it's pleasing to see it go well for Facepunch with s&amp;box. They've now added native Linux binaries for the dedicated server and game client. If you missed the open source news be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sandbox-from-rust-developer-facepunch-is-now-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder on what s&amp;box is — "s&amp;box is a game creation platform built on the Source 2 engine and our spiritual successor to Garry's Mod. Play, create, and share games, explore community creations, and experience endless sandbox fun with powerful modern tools."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4012086421764779748gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://sbox.game/news/update-25-12-03" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the developers noted the response has been pretty awesome. From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Open Source Response</h4>
<p>The response to us going open source has been overwhelmingly positive, in a week we've received <strong>over 3000 stars </strong>and<strong> over 80 pull requests </strong>and 30 already merged.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for contributing and being interested in the project, the pull requests have been great so far from small bug fixes to proper features. It's giving us a lot more momentum.<br/>
<br/>
We've been refining the repo sync workflows, GitHub actions now run formatting and unit tests on PRs, so any older PRs will need to update their branch to pass these tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Linux that also got a mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Open Source: Linux Binaries</h4>
<p>I've added native Linux binaries to the open source repo for enthusiasts to play around with, these are for the dedicated server and game client only. Source 2 tools don't compile for Linux.</p>
<p>These are not shipped on Steam as they're not usable yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if any proper Linux support expands from this. Fun to see though, and since it's open source anyone can try and do anything with it thanks to the permissive MIT license (<a href="http://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-public" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). But for now on Steam, you'll still need to run it with Valve's Proton compatibility layer. The game / game editor also isn't technically even released yet, it's still in developer preview while they build it up towards a proper Steam release.</p>
<p>More developers should do open source!</p>

<p><strong>Update 04/12/25 10:26 UTC</strong> - The developers are being accused of using AI generation for the game. There's been a lot of chatter across social media about it. In reply, the publisher Running With Scissors <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1996223528698273970" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on X/Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. We hear your concerns, and we can assure everyone the art in question contained no AI, being as real as Krotchy’s cojones. This was simply a case of misidentification. We’ve taken the step of substituting the art ahead of time to keep the focus on the new game announcement. For the curious, please see this video for the old art’s PSD layers: <a class="css-1jxf684 r-1loqt21 r-1ttztb7 r-1wvb978 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8wzEjmxRw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtube.com/watch?v=ed8wzEjmxRw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>2. “POSTAL: Bullet Paradise” is being developed by Goonswarm Games, a wholly talented team that we at Running With Scissors fully entrust and support as they embody the indie spirit we hold dear.</p>
<p>3. We are proud and excited to publish this upcoming bullet-heaven FPS and deliver to our longtime beloved fans a wild new entry in the POSTAL series that delves into its ever-growing multiverse!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the comments from the YouTube video ("Canceled Key Art Timeline Full Windowed") linked by RWS from the developer Goonswarm Games that's supposed to prove it's not AI, there's a lot pointing out <em>again</em> it looks to be made with AI. There's a whole lot on X/Twitter pointing out many flaws in the proof video too.</p>
<p>I've reached out directly to ask for more information on what's going on.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Ready to go POSTAL once more? This time it's in a survivor-like bullet-heaven styled setting, because obviously every developer needs to be in this genre now. Not that I am complaining, it actually reminds me of the time it felt like everyone was attempting some sort of Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Here you get to suit up and cause some chaos as one of 11 playable POSTAL Dudes from different timelines. Each with their own starting loadout and perks as you blast through hordes of enemies. And, because it's a survivor-like, you will get cards thrown at you to pick upgrades to evolve your POSTAL Dude during a run.</p>
<p>It will be playable entirely solo but you will also be able to team up in online co-op with four players max. Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>From the press release: “POSTAL: Bullet Paradise is all about releasing the essence of POSTAL and its signature gallows humor into an over-the-top and highly replayable package,” said Artem Korovkin, CEO, Goonswarm Games. “Equal parts irreverent and action-packed, we’re thrilled to partner with Running With Scissors to bring this dystopian slice of Paradise to life.”</p>
<p>“No way in Hell Mike J is going to Heaven,” laughed Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi. “But he’s definitely gunning for POSTAL: Bullet Paradise next year.”</p>
<p>According to the press release it will have Linux, macOS and Windows support at release in Q3 2026 and will be priced at $19.99.</p>

      <title>No Players Online returns after an &#39;unfounded DMCA claim&#39; halted sales for nearly three weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing yet again that the DMCA system is not fit for purpose, No Players Online launched on Steam on November 6 and then got taken down but it's back.</p>
<p>What is it? <!-- squire -->No Players Online is an expanded now-commercial remake of the free 2019 cult-hit that's still up on <a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/no-players-online-classic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. The story goes: buried among the files on the computer is a broken multiplayer shooter that seems to have been left running for years. As you progress, you will be pulled further and further into the rotting digital world that will twist your curiosity into an obsession as new secrets about the world behind the screen are revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1805232181764776997gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What happened? After launching on November 6th, sometime around November 13th the game was abruptly hidden on Steam. Turns out, a "former friend" of the developers sent Valve a DMCA notice. Thankfully, the situation has been sorted and the game has returned but the damage to their launch has been done.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recently, No Players Online was removed from steam for nearly 3 weeks right after launch following a DMCA claim made by a former friend. they claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. NPO was made completely from scratch by our team.</p>
<p>despite trying to clarify to them the past couple months that their allegations were completely unfounded, they recklessly filed the DMCA to steam without any notice, and the game was taken down on november 13th. we immediately filed a counter-notice, and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed.</p>
<p>we spent 2 and a half years of our lives and a ton of money making this game. we also have a lot of people who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. it’s crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form, and it’s been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone i considered a dear friend.</p>
<p>we sincerely apologize to everyone who was unable to purchase or access the game during the past few weeks. this situation has had a significant impact on us, especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us. we lost out on much needed momentum and revenue right after the release of our game and we’re unsure if we will be able to recover financially from this given our already thin margins.</p>
<p>we are committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online, but at this point we are unsure about the future of our studio. any visibility on our game at this point would be crucial, so if you want to support a little indie studio please leave a review on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">steam</a> and share the game to the internet. &lt;3</p>
<p>much love,<br/>
adam pype, the beeswax team and black lantern collective.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 file-size on Steam gets massively reduced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One problem with a lot of modern games is just how big they're getting, but HELLDIVERS 2 is about to massively shrink thanks to work behind the scenes. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios noted they pulled in Nixxes to help get it sorted.</p>
<p>They were making small changes across a few patches, but now the big stuff is here and you can try it out in a Steam Beta via the "prod_slim" branch. Right click the game, go to Properties -&gt; Beta and select "prod_slim" from the drop-down box. The result should be a reduction in installation size from "~154GB to ~23GB". What an insane difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16513124621764772857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How did they do this? By "completely de-duplicating our data". They didn't do it before as they were worried about loading times for players who still have a traditional spinning HDD instead of an SSD. Something they spoke about in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previous news post</a> to explain it a little more. But as it turns out, the difference is only a few seconds.</p>
<p>This will become the default for everyone once they've gone through feedback from the Beta to allow time for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>A big new update also just rolled out with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0</a> that brought with it the fun new premium warbond that has a minigun along with lots of improvements to the game overall.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s now an AI warning notice browser plugin for itch.io as well as Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer behind the useful <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/the-useful-ai-warning-for-steam-script-has-been-turned-into-a-proper-browser-extension/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI notice browser plugin for Steam</a> has now done the same for <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, and they've made it easier to use the extensions.</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux they mentioned the itch.io version is available as a native extension for Firefox and Chrome, or as a userscript if you prefer. On itch.io developers do have to tag their games as using AI <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/itchio-store-now-requires-ai-generated-content-disclosures-for-assets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since November 2024</a>, but it appears there's no actual notice on game pages at all, not even in the "More information" bit you can expand. <em>There is a specific category for AI games with a huge 26,328 tagged.</em></p>
<p>So hopefully this plugin will help any of you that shop across itch.io too. Here's how it looks which is very similar to the Steam version:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5528752571764771859gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Now you can't miss it.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned "Both extensions can now be installed natively in Firefox for Android. This was already possible with the userscript version, but now it's easier". And, additionally, you can even add it directly into the Steam client using <a href="https://steambrew.app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Millennium</a> and <a href="https://steambrew.app/plugin?id=788ed8554492" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Extendium</a> although it's not supported and not exactly clear if it's against Steam's rules.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">You can find it via for itch.io:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ai-warning-for-itch-io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Firefox</a></li>

      <title>Valve have been funding FEX to get x86 games on Arm Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It turns out that not only are Valve using the open source <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FEX</a> for the Steam Frame but they have been funding FEX since the beginning of it.</p>
<p>What exactly is FEX? FEX allows you to run x86 applications on ARM64 Linux devices, similar to qemu-user and box64. It offers broad compatibility with both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries, and it can be used alongside Wine/Proton to play Windows games.</p>
<p>Recently, the FEX lead Ryan Houdek wrote a 7 year anniversary <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> where in it they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone! In light of the recent product announcements using FEX, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate our anniversary! On this day seven years ago (28th Nov 2018), I landed the first commit in the prototype project that would eventually become FEX-Emu! I want to thank the people from Valve for being here from the start and allowing me to kickstart this project. They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense with the Steam Frame, since it will be using a Snapdragon processor - Valve needed a way to get traditional games and apps to work on it and not just those designed for it. Much like how Proton made sure the Steam Deck was a success and has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pushed Linux overall to new heights</a>, FEX should hopefully do the same for the Steam Frame and any other future hardware using Arm.</p>
<p>Unlike Proton though, which was based on the existing Wine project with some extras they also fund like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton, Valve was there for the formation of FEX.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton is also something where you could say we started it, but because it’s a derivative of Wine, it’s less clear-cut. Whereas Fex, we were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts. We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't go expecting a Steam Phone any time soon though it sounds like they're happy with living room, handheld, and desktop. But, since FEX is open source people are already using it to get Windows games running on phones.</p>
<p>It's all about giving options and removing barriers, so that you will hopefully eventually get the same experience across x86 and Arm for gaming thanks to the likes of Proton, FEX and other open source projects that Valve fund. We all benefit from it thanks to it all being open source.</p>

      <title>Half-Life Legacy arrives December 12 but you&#39;ll need Proton on Linux due to Native Linux issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life Legacy is an enhanced fan mod of Valve's original shooter and it's releasing December 12th. The developers claim it is the "ultimate restoration for the legendary title". It comes with full controller support, achievements, speedrunning, dynamic weapon lighting, Steam Workshop support, Rich Presence for Steam &amp; Discord and much more.</p>
<p>The developers noted they've been trying to sort out a Native Linux version, but they've been facing some problems with it. As <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3619040/announcements/detail/538871739033060374" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also have important news to share regarding the <strong>Linux</strong> version of the game. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have been unable to port <em>Half-Life Legacy </em>to Linux, unlike <em>Cross Product.</em></p>
<p>Linux is a platform we've been targeting since late 2020 and one of the major reasons keeping us on it is Steam Deck playability. Sadly, due to a very strange issue we have spent many hours of our time diagnosing, we cannot release <em>Half-Life Legacy </em>with native Linux support. Despite this, the game has been tested via Proton on Linux Mint and Steam Deck (Steam OS) where it works with no major issues, so for now, Steam Play saves the day.</p>
<p>We will add native Linux support as soon as we can but this issue is not easy to solve. If you're confident with vague debugger errors and complicated issues, feel free to reach out to us via our Discord or a comment on this post, but I do warn you - it's not easy.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 44 will get improved NTSYNC enabling for Proton / Wine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NTSYNC has been available in the Linux kernel for a while, but it's taking distributions a while to actually use it - Fedora Linux 44 will make it easier.</p>
<p>What is NTSYNC? Arriving with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux kernel 6.14</a> the aim of it was mainly to help accuracy and performance for NT synchronization primitives when translating between Windows apps / games and Linux with Proton / Wine. As an eventual full and better replacement for the likes of esync and fsync. For plain Wine, it will be quite a nice boost - but Proton won't see too much of a difference in most things.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/NTSYNC-Contained" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new change</a> proposal has now been <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3510" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">accepted</a> for Fedora Linux 44 that will enable it when it detects specific packages being used - notably Wine and Steam (for Proton). NTSync has been available in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/wine-10-16-released-with-fast-synchronization-support-using-ntsync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine since version 10.16</a> but is not currently used by the official Proton (GE-Proton can use it).</p>
<p>Hopefully this will give gamers on Fedora a better overall experience with the likes of Wine.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 590.44.01 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first release of the 590 driver branch has arrived in Beta for Linux with 590.44.01 now available for those willing to give it a test. For those of you with an NVIDIA GPU that need the most stable experience, you should probably stick with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/nvidia-driver-580-105-08-out-now-for-linux-as-the-new-recommended-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">driver 580.105.08 from early November</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog provided by NVIDIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Raised the minimum supported Wayland version to 1.20.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the PowerMizer preferred mode dropdown menu in the nvidia-settings control panel from functioning correctly on Wayland.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported glibc version to 2.27.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of recreating Vulkan swapchains. This helps prevent stuttering when resizing Vulkan application windows.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.17 (video driver ABI version 19).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Dots Per Inch (DPI) to be incorrectly reported for some monitors such as the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9.</li>
<li>Fixed several problems that prevented Vulkan applications from working on Venus VirtIO virtual GPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause system freezes on PREEMPT_RT kernels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this Beta driver have a fix you've been waiting on? If not, what are you waiting on?</p>
<p><strong>Update 03/12/25 10:31 UTC</strong> - NVIDIA have updated their website so that Maxwell, Pascal and Volta are no longer listed in the Supported Products page for this driver. When the Beta initially released they were still listing them but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-confirm-upcoming-driver-will-be-the-last-for-maxwell-pascal-and-volta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as they previously announced</a> they're no longer supported in the 590+ series.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now freshly Steam Deck Verified and with MicroProse Software backing it as publisher, TFC: The Fertile Crescent has a big upgrade out now. A pretty sweet real-time strategy game that's like a pixel-art version of Age of Empires, with an interesting food mechanic that will challenge even veterans of the genre.</p>
<p>Great to see the developer has pulled in some more support for this overlooked gem. Thanks to the new partnership update 1.3 brings translations for the game into German, French, Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Portugese (Brazil), Russian, Simplified Chinese and Spanish. On top of that the last bit needed (on-screen keyboard) was sorted to enable it to get Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s version of Android on Linux (based on Waydroid) is now called Lepton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lepton appears to be the new official name for Valve's version of Waydroid (Android in a Linux container).</p>
<p>We still don't have a whole lot of details about how this is all going to work, outside of Lepton enabling Android APKs for developers on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Frame VR kit</a>, but it's now that little bit more official with a proper name and even a logo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2808312871764672482gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>An interesting looking frog there. No doubt an in-joke from a certain Linux developer Discord server. As for the name, it seems to fit in quite well with the other compatibility layer Proton for Windows games on Linux. Seems Valve are keeping to a similar theme with their naming there.</p>
<p>Courtesy of SteamDB there's a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3029110/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">main page</a> and a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3056000/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">development version</a> with both actually having (rather blank) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202053950/https://store.steampowered.com/app/3029110/Lepton/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam pages</a>. I imagine the Steam pages will probably be hidden soon, just like Proton doesn't have an actual Steam page I doubt this will either.</p>
<p>We also saw that recently Valve added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamworks-sdk-adds-support-for-linux-arm-and-android-and-it-seems-we-know-the-first-android-game-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for Linux Arm and Android to the Steamworks SDK</a>.</p>
<p>It's definitely going to be fun to see what kinds of developers get on board with the Steam Frame, and perhaps even more exciting if we can get Lepton running directly on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS machines too. I don't really expect Valve to have it locked to the Steam Frame - but we don't know yet.</p>

      <title>Linux players on Steam hit an all-time high for November 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the statistics from the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for November 2025, which shows once again that Linux use is trending nicely upwards.</p>
<p>Slow and steady wins the race? Thanks in part due to all of Valve's work with SteamOS and Proton, and thanks to Microsoft forcing AI rubbish in Windows - more people are checking Linux out than ever before.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For November 2025 the overall operating system share is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - 94.79%</li>
<li>Linux - 3.20%</li>
<li>macOS - 2.02%</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a> is up to date for the Linux overall trend, as well as our newer distribution chart as well. Here's a snapshot from it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2143213141764660986gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2143213141764660986gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the breakdown of popular Linux distributions on Steam here's November's details:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 26.42% -0.76%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.97% -0.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.2 64 bit 7.36% +0.71%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 6.74% +0.73%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 25.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.96% +1.67%</li>
<li>Bazzite 64 bit 5.53% +1.29%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.29% -0.26%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 64 bit 3.86% +0.16%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.10% -0.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 1.96% -0.60%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 1.90% -0.03%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 1.90% -0.14%</li>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) 64 bit 1.58% +1.58%</li>
<li>
<p>Other 20.43% +2.39%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not entirely clear what Valve uses to sort the Linux list, as distributions seem to randomly flick in and out of it each month. Would be nice if we could just get a full list each month. The order has been all messed up for a few months too across various parts of the survey, hopefully Valve will eventually fix that.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 48: Byzantine Labyrinthine</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-47-before-i-was-born/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 47: Before I Was Born</a></strong></p>
<p>In my formative years it was accepted by most that the point and click adventure game was a dead genre. Sure, a handful were still being made, but more often than not these remained nostalgic takes hearkening back to the true heyday of the genre. Most devotees would instead stick to their old favourites, even in the face of mounting incompatibility challenges. These were issues that The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. would attempt to solve, starting with <em>Inherit the Earth</em> and <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em>.</p>
<p>First released for Linux in December 2004, both games were retooled to use the Simple DirectMedia Layer, but were otherwise kept as faithful ports of the originals for good or ill. For the <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> some audio improvements were made, but the only new addition was the "breadcrumbs" navigation feature that I never felt the need to use. Being built around the multimedia capabilities offered by the arrival of CD-ROM, <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> from 1993 is an arthouse first and a game second.</p>
<p>You can even play the game from the CD-ROM itself rather than installing it to your hard drive, although in either case I found I had to preload the libSDL-1.2.so.0 library included in the "common/lib" directory on the disc for it to launch. From here you are thrown straight into the game, with little chance to get your bearings. Vital tools I found for navigating the world included using the tab key to highlight interactable items as well as using the right mouse button to open your inventory screen.</p>
<p>With its age in mind I always figured I would need to consult a walkthrough, but I still gave the game an honest attempt at first; wandering through the hotel, mapping the mirror maze, and even reaching the ghost town of Revolver Springs before giving in. In the end it was the inscrutable user interface that foiled my progress, as while I did discover the drawer in the town jail which contained the brass key I required, the opened drawer then needed to be examined further to reveal the key inside.</p>
<p>The taboo of consulting the Adventurer's Guide now broken, I just went ahead and allowed it to lead me the rest of the way. The puzzles in the game are a means to an end, with the primary focus being to show off the 3D scenes and art assets created by Bradley W. Schenck. Playing <em>Freaks!</em> did show that I have an appreciation for exploring anachronistic worlds, but with only fixed images being used here to represent the four cardinal directions of any given space, I did find this harder to enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12242328631764659696gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12242328631764659696gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3581957381764659695gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3581957381764659695gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I have had some success coming back to old adventure games many years after using a walkthrough, and relying on my hazy memories to then solve them in a more organic fashion instead. Perhaps that will also be the case here, but <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> does play enough nasty tricks to make this seem a false hope. There are three separate instances where the game can be left unbeatable if you use a puzzle item too early, or if you fail to acquire a certain item before proceeding elsewhere.</p>
<p>One of these items is even hidden behind a door in such a way as to almost ensure you will miss it, with the significance of the item not being signposted in any conspicuous way. This lack of connective tissue is a real hurdle, and is the main Achilles heel of the game. While not exactly suffering from the "moon logic" that plagued so much of the genre, <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> lacks a driving purpose after Daedalus sends you on your way, with puzzle solutions holding little relation to their point of origin.</p>
<p>Keys are distributed at random, pulling levers will cause inexplicable events to happen elsewhere in the world, and your actions appear aimless without context clues to guide you; one event wherein the subway car becomes flattened even failed to happen to me as described. There are exceptions, including a clever conceit where you take advantage of the fact you have been taken outside the flow of time to alter historical events, but these highlights do little to overcome your initial bafflement.</p>
<p>None of this is helped by the smug presumption of the original developers, with them glorifying themselves in the backstory and teasing a sequel at the end. I think the game would have been better served if it was broken into discrete hubs, with more focus on the individual areas, and with the narrative being spread beyond just a handful of infodumps in a few key places. In the same vein is the soundtrack, with the music drilled into your head on an endless loop rather divided to accentuate specific spaces.</p>
<p>Much of <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> is just straight up mazes, only serving to underline the importance of the map screen; even with this aid I still failed to comprehend the surreal maze I blundered through right before the end. The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. did have plans to craft its own sequels, but have done little beside updating their initial ports for sale on digital storefronts since. The adventure genre would later advance through both ScummVM and the Indie game revival, but the timing was not right.</p>

      <title>Hytale devs confirm they are working to bring it to Linux and macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the revival of Hytale ongoing towards an Early Access release in January, we now have it confirmed that it will be coming officially to Linux and macOS.</p>
<p>Previously it was a case of them being "attempted" but a new <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> today gives us a much more firm statement with the developers saying "We are actively working to bring Hytale to Linux and Mac as soon as possible". That's great to see - official support! Hopefully it goes well.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Deck they said they don't have the ability to test it right now, and it won't be coming to Steam until "we determine our ability to comply with Steam's policies". Thankfully for the Steam Deck and other SteamOS machines, running third-party stores and software is quite easy as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a bunch of our guides will show you</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes into quite a lot of detail on the suggested system requirements for it. For the requirements it will be harder on your system for single-player, as it will run both the client and server it needs. This is what they're recommending at least for 1080p:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or equivalent)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16 GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrated:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Intel Iris Xe Graphics</li>
<li>AMD Radeon 660M</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GTX 900 Series</li>
<li>AMD Radeon 400 Series</li>
<li>Intel Arc A-Series</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deprecation notice:</strong> Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> SSD with 20 GB of free space</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 8 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more to it, I do suggest reading the full post.</p>
<p>Some previous full gameplay videos can be seen below if you missed them. Keeping in mind they are a heavy work in progress, the game isn't close to being finished after all the delays, cancellation and revival.</p>

      <title>GOG add the huge S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. as a one-click mod install</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. is a big mod for the already big standalone experience of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly and now easier to install thanks to <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>It's all getting a bit <em>complicated</em> in the Stalker world now so if you're a wee bit confused (I was) here's the basics: Anomaly is a standalone game <em>based on</em> the original series. It blurs the line between mod and fan game. <a href="https://www.stalkergamma.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gamma</a> (Gigantic Automated Modular Modpack for Anomaly) expands it even further but it can be tricky to install it all together where it works nicely. It's all free and now you can get it together in one neat package.</p>

      <title>A retro Acorn RISC OS gem returns with Exodus: The Colonization of Space now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of gaming history returns to modern platforms with the release of Exodus: The Colonization of Space now available on Steam. Originally released all the way back in 1997 for Acorn RISC OS computers (an old British company), a name I've not heard in a long time - I'm sure we had an Acorn computer in my original primary school class.</p>
<p>Created by then-developer Artex Software as their first commcerial game, the founders of it would go onto creating Deck13, a name more of you may be familiar with as the developers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen. Artex have now returned too but as a publisher and Exodus: The Colonization of Space is just a little retro treat<em>.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZGP1Ld8u4c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4c52917bd4475c0586cb03129ded6a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZGP1Ld8u4c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pixely 256-color game focuses on founding a new civilization in space after earth was abandoned. The players colonize planets, deal with (or fight against) up to 14 computer opponents. They build up the surface of their planets, make laws for their people, trade with neighboring planets and fend off mean space pirates. There are turn-based battles, a science tree, and endless possibilities to build a pixel galaxy… or fail trying.</p>
<p>Exodus is a true retro game but has been brought into the 21st century with over 60 gameplay improvements and features like autosave and keyboard shortcuts. As it was originally released on the Acorn Archimedes, few retro gamers have ever played this little gem… Now is your chance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The re-release arrives with Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Arch-based distro EndeavourOS gets a new Ganymede release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best ways to try out a form of Arch Linux, the popular <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EndeavourOS</a> has a new release with Ganymede out now. Being careful with my wording not to attract the pitchforks from the pure Arch Linux crowd, EndeavourOS is <em>mostly</em> Arch Linux but with a simple to use installer and some packaging tweaks to make getting up and running simple with it.</p>
<p>So all the fresh upgrades you get from Arch Linux, wrapped up in an easy to use package. Now and then they release a big refresh of their ISO downloads, which bring various tweaks and now after some time waiting - their latest release Ganymede has officially arrived.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2906056391764602175gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2906056391764602175gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - EndeavourOS Ganymede</em></p>
<p>The live environment to play around with it and install it comes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Calamares 25.11.1.9-1</li>
<li>Firefox 145.0.1-1</li>
<li>Linux 6.17.8.arch1-1</li>
<li>Mesa 1:25.2.7-1</li>
<li>xorg-server 21.1.20-1 (xorg)</li>
<li>Nvidia-utils 580.105.08-4</li>
<li>KDE Plasma 6.5.3</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://endeavouros.com/news/the-long-wait-is-over-ganymede-has-arrived/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they say it has significantly improved support for NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the 50 most popular Steam Deck games for November 2025 - with Dispatch the winner</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's a fresh month and that means we can take a look and see what's been popular for players on Valve's SteamOS powered handheld the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A good chance to see not just what's popular, but also some ideas perhaps on what to pick up for your next game. Like November 2025's number 1 - Dispatch, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/i-have-finished-dispatch-and-now-im-at-a-loss-so-im-going-to-play-it-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I also thought was pretty amazing</a>. ARC Raiders is a new one this time, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which can run on Steam Deck</a> but you might find it's a bit unstable (and doesn't look very good). Another new entry is Where Winds Meet which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/where-winds-meet-devs-plan-improved-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">should be getting some Steam Deck optimisations</a> too.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi prices are rising due to RAM costs, plus a new 1GB Raspberry Pi 5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With RAM costs spiralling upwards right now, we're going to see increases to the pricing of lots of hardware - and now it's hit Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/1gb-raspberry-pi-5-now-available-at-45-and-memory-driven-price-rises/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from the Raspberry Pi team, to help soften the blow a new 1GB Raspberry Pi 5 was revealed at $45 / ~£43.20. For the prices that are increasing here's what they sent along:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Product</strong></td>
<td><strong>Density</strong></td>
<td><strong>Old price</strong></td>
<td><strong>New price</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 4</td>
<td>4GB</td>
<td>$55</td>
<td>$60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 4</td>
<td>8GB</td>
<td>$75</td>
<td>$85</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>1GB</td>
<td>–</td>
<td>$45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>2GB</td>
<td>$50</td>
<td>$55</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>4GB</td>
<td>$60</td>
<td>$70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>8GB</td>
<td>$80</td>
<td>$95</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>16GB</td>
<td>$120</td>
<td>$145</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>They said the 16GB variant of the Compute Module 5 has also gone up by $20. However older lower-density Raspberry Pi models remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Right now the hardware industry just sucks for consumers in terms of pricing. A lot of it thanks to many companies increasing their AI workloads, sucking up all the hardware availability. You've likely seen some reports elsewhere on how 64GB of RAM is often now more expensive than an entire PlayStation 5. I checked that today and - yep, insanity. Lots of RAM completely out of stock, lots of them suggesting delivery would be in <em>multiple</em> months time.</p>

      <title>KDE Connect security advisory released due to possible authentication bypass</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Connect is a popular cross-platform app that allows you to send files across devices and more - with a security advisory being sent out due to a woops. Noted as CVE-2025-66270, that woops could allow an attacker to entirely skip proper authentication.</p>
<p>An overview of the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Versions of KDE Connect released after March 2025 implement version 8 of the KDE Connect protocol. In this version, the discovery of other devices with KDE Connect on your network involves an additional packet exchange between the two devices. While the first packet is used to determine if a device is paired or not, this additional packet is used to identify the device that is connecting.</p>
<p>The vulnerable implementations of KDE Connect were not checking that the device ID in the first packet and the device ID in the second packet were the same. This could be abused by first sending a device ID of an unpaired device which doesn't require authentication, followed by sending the device ID of a paired device in order to impersonate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vulnerable versions they list are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>KDE Connect desktop &gt;= 25.04 and &lt; 25.12</li>
<li>KDE Connect iOS &gt;= v0.5.2 and &lt; 0.5.4</li>
<li>KDE Connect Android &gt;= v1.33.0 and &lt; 1.34.4</li>
<li>GSConnect &gt;= 59 and &lt; 68</li>
<li>Valent &gt;= v1.0.0.alpha.47 and &lt; v1.0.0.alpha.49</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The KDE developers are suggesting you stop using KDE Connect until your Linux distribution releases an update for it, or to manually patch it yourself if you're able to.</p>

      <title>Piece by Piece is a sweet looking puzzle platformer where you literally connect pieces to progress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This looks absolutely wonderful! A puzzle platformer that takes things quite literally with you running, jumping and building your path from puzzle pieces. </p>
<p>Made by developer Neon Polygons with the open source cross-platform <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, it has a Native Linux demo available on Steam for you to try. I'm surprised I didn't spot this one until now, so perhaps you missed it too. There's just too many good games releasing and being teased all the time.</p>
<p>Have a little look at the demo trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ETp1hEq12Ks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16ebdabb3ceaf4c478277bedc1520cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ETp1hEq12Ks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Piece by Piece is a LITERAL puzzle-platformer where each level is fragmented into puzzle pieces for you to traverse through by stitching together the level...piece by piece. </p>

<p><em>A little confusing though, since there's also the game also called Piece by Piece coming from Gamkat / No More Robots. So one of them might want to change their name…</em></p>

      <title>UZDoom the successor to GZDoom has a first proper release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What will now be the main modern feature centric port for all Doom engine games, UZDoom has a first proper release out to take over from GZDoom. If you're confused on what happened with GZDoom - be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the previous GamingOnLinux article</a> covering the drama.</p>
<p>For people making mod packs and standalone games, UZDoom is probably what you want to be using going forwards. This small release is to get the ball rolling, while bigger changes are queued up for UZDoom 5 that will come later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17807159551764586566gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom 2 with UZDoom</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Changes from GZDoom 4.14.2 from the <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=81099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple security fixes. <strong>This update is being deemed as critical.</strong> It’s highly recommended to upgrade to it.</li>
<li>Anisotropic filtering is now disabled on Intel GPU devices if the texture filtering mode is set to any of the None options. This is to prevent texture filtering from being forced on when anisotropic filtering is enabled.</li>
<li>Added new game-based cursors (courtesy of Nash Muhandes and Xaser). These are much more cursor-y, and very good at pointing and clicking on things.</li>
<li>Changed defaults to be more balanced between vanilla and modern.</li>
<li>Lowered the master volume so it's less likely to blow out the system audio and become muffled (especially with things like the Plasma Rifle firing sound).</li>
<li>Added the Default option for automap colors, allowing the automap to choose based on which game is being played.</li>
<li>Added a Display option to control the render style of rocket explosions (these now default to additive instead of translucent since we felt it visually fit the other projectiles better).</li>
<li>Made the mouse less sensitive in menus when it’s been dormant for a short period. This should help reduce it accidentally shifting the selected option randomly while idle.</li>
<li>Added the <em>powerup_fade_scalar</em> cvar for controlling the strength of the fade on power ups (e.g. the Radiation Suit’s green tint).</li>
<li>Added support for the <strong>BUSY</strong> script flag for ACS.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not muting properly when the game is unfocused, causing it to build up and play back explosively in certain cases (especially for multiplayer games).</li>
<li>Fixed the master volume not properly applying to music when the game starts up.</li>
<li>Fixed weapon bobbing not disabling correctly when manually set to 0 via cvar.</li>
<li>Fixed the wrong music being played during Strife’s bad endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the opening subtitle for Strife not displaying.</li>
<li>Fixed the Iron Lich’s whirlwind blaming the wrong target for its damage dealt.</li>
<li>Fixed the textured automap being broken.</li>
<li>Fixed mid textures clipping incorrectly when skewed.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with VisualThinkers when loading from a save.</li>
<li>Fixed IQM models with decoupled animations not displaying correctly if spawned without an animation.</li>
<li>Fixed gun flashes from MBF21 weapons not displaying correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with <strong>CreateTossable</strong> where items wouldn’t be removed if their amount was 0.</li>
<li>Fixed Quat’s <strong>Conjugate</strong> and <strong>Inverse</strong> functions throwing a JIT error.</li>
<li>Fixed the BrokenLines class being unserializable.</li>
<li>Fixed level data fields e.g. Sector not being cleared properly when transitioning between levels.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Core Keeper set for a massive update in January with a new boss, automation, new weapons and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might be the most exciting update for Core Keeper yet bringing in loads of new tools and a big boss battle to the mining sandbox adventure. <em>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>You'll be able to jump in when update releases on January 28th, when it also arrives on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What's in it? A ridiculous amount by the sounds of it. They're not giving out exactly what, we'll have to wait for the patch notes at release day. Some of what they explained includes a whole new Beyond the Passage biome with a huge boss battle and brand new automation systems. Since there's new enemies, you also get new tools including: miniguns, mortars, grenades, remote detonators and even a flamethrower.</p>
<p>Loads more too so check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Hytale arrives in Early Access in January 2026 after being revived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being cancelled by Riot Games and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hytale-has-been-saved-as-hypixel-acquired-it-from-riot-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revived as an indie game again</a>, Hytale is now set for an Early Access launch in January 2026. Pre-purchasing will open December 13th, with it going live January 13th.</p>
<p>No doubt many are excited about this since it had a lot of followers watching it in previous years, thanks to its blend of a sort-of Minecraft style but more of a proper RPG. So a bit like Minecraft and Skyrim combined you might say.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer makes it clear this will be a very real <em>early</em> access, not like a lot of the early access styled stuff we see on Steam where the game is nearly finished. This will be "very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while" and they expect the "first impression will be rough". Still, it's going to be nice to finally see it out, and with the creators actually in full control.</p>
<p>Just over a week ago they also put up a nice long slice of gameplay too:</p>

      <title>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has another patch for Steam Deck and to improve performance for all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault from Digital Sun and 11 bit studios should run a whole lot smoother for everyone now, and feel better on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-enters-early-access-and-work-is-ongoing-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the last big patch</a>, another update has been rolled out that should be a pretty dramatic improvement to the feel of it overall. There's a fair bit more to the patch than just performance upgrades and tweak for Steam Deck but the highlights for you are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Big pass on stuttering. We’ve cleaned up a lot of unused or unnecessary data throughout the game. You should now see way less stuttering, and in many cases, virtually none at all.</li>
<li>Controls, performance, and menus are more Deck-friendly now, ie, Settings and Difficulty selection screen being easier to read and navigate.</li>
<li>Default Steam Deck graphics settings now use FSR3 – Quality instead of Balanced, for a sharper, more stable look right from the start.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again - it's great to see such dedicated support for Steam Deck / SteamOS. Always great to see, as a result it should run even better on Desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>

<p>More about it from the Steam page: "Dive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around."</p>

      <title>itch.io is hosting a creator day today where they take no fee from developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of doing their own Black Friday sale, the indie store <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> has its Creator Day today as well where they take no cut from developers. A nice chance to support a smaller store that does a fair amount of good for indies, along with supporting indies directly.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of weird stuff on itch.io though including old demos, old alpha versions of games and more - it can be pretty difficult to find the good. So keeping that in mind I previously <a href="https://itch.io/c/1674813/best-linux-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">created a list</a> of some great Linux games you can find on the store. All the games in that special curated list have a Native Linux version too. There's over 160 games in my collection with a whole bunch more that I added in today for you.</p>
<p>Some quick highlights that are actually on a sale of some sort:</p>
<p><a href="https://itch.io/s/167286/black-friday-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Double Fine Productions Bundle</a><br/>
<em>Plenty of classics inside like Full Throttle Remastered</em></p>
<p><a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>Fast-paced dungeon crawling where dice rolls control the flow</em></p>
<p><a href="https://devolverdigital.itch.io/terra-nil" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Terra Nil</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>Transforming a barren, lifeless landscape into a thriving, vibrant ecosystem</em></p>
<p><a href="https://devolverdigital.itch.io/pikuniku" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pikuniku</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>A charming puzzle-exploration platformer</em></p>
<p><a href="https://eniko.itch.io/midboss" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MidBoss</a> - 33% off<br/>
<em>A body-snatching roguelike that's like nothing else</em></p>
<p><a href="https://ellpeck.itch.io/tiny-life" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tiny Life</a> - 25% off<br/>
<em>The Sims but pixel art basically</em></p>
<p>Loads more in my list that are not on sale but you can help support the developer with the itch.io Creator Day.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> for all the deals. It only lasts 24 hours so it ends 8am UTC tomorrow.</p>

      <title>Where Winds Meet devs plan improved Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where Winds Meet continues to be a big hit on Steam and it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/the-big-new-where-winds-meet-release-works-well-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">works quite well on Desktop Linux</a> but it needs a lot of improvements on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck even with various settings dropped down and upscaling, the performance in various parts is just not playable with drops down to 20FPS and at times below. Thankfully, for any fans of this free to play RPG, there's plans from the developer Everstone Studio to get things into better shape.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3564740/view/606425106922604161" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> post on Steam dated November 23rd, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the next two months, we will gradually roll out several updates, <strong>including Steam Deck compatibility</strong>, optimized multi-timezone display, split outfit customization, PS5 Pro support for PSSR, enhanced audio experience, and more. Our goal is to create a Jianghu that everyone can enjoy, and we welcome any further suggestions you may have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours</em></p>
<p>Hopefully we won't be waiting too long on that. And, hopefully they actually get it to perform to a reasonable level. Optimising for the lower-end helps players across all hardware! Oh, and if they could actually make the settings available before forcing you into the game that would be good too. That's a sin some developers still haven't stopped.</p>
<p>Currently, the game is rated Steam Deck Unsupported by Valve. No anti-cheat annoyances though, you can jump in just fine - we're tracking various games on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated Linux / SteamOS anti-cheat page</a>.</p>

      <title>Nightdive Studios present a Blood: Refreshed Supply deep dive in a new video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to know more about the upcoming Blood: Refreshed Supply? You're in luck as we have a fresh developer video from Nightdive Studios. Arriving on December 4th, Blood: Refreshed Supply will become the actual true definitive edition of the game. The previous edition, Blood: Fresh Supply, is being removed from stores once this has released. You get 66.6% discount if you have the original.</p>
<p>Anyway - the deep dive. That's why you're here. The latest video features creators of the new Marrow and Death Wish episodes of Blood: Refreshed Supply, Dustin Twilley and Nick Palsmeier to talk about their experience creating the expansions and more behind the scenes work on the newer edition of the game.</p>
<p>Grab a coffee and watch below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RxsYD69oiRA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/985111a39995144250ac216cd9922b43.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RxsYD69oiRA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Key Features: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Legendary Return: The cult-classic, blood-soaked shooter makes its console debut</li>
<li>Modern Performance: Up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS on PlayStation 4|5 and Xbox One and Series X|S</li>
<li>Fully Customizable Controls: Keyboard, mouse, and controller support tailored for modern play</li>
<li>Enhanced Modding Tools: Expanded mod support, including compatibility with existing community creations</li>
<li>Multiplayer Mayhem: Local split-screen and cross-platform online play for up to eight players across co-op, PvP “Bloodbath,” and 4v4 “Capture the Flag” modes</li>
<li>Classic Sound Options: Switch between CD and MIDI music for an authentic retro experience</li>
<li>Complete Content Collection: Includes the Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage expansions</li>
<li>New Blood Awaits: Two new mission scenarios, Marrow (available at launch) and Death Wish (free post-launch), inject fresh carnage into the classic campaign</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I fully expect it to work well on Linux with Proton at release, just like previous Nightdive games.</p>

      <title>SIDE EFFECTS is a disturbing pill-popping roulette game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SIDE EFFECTS from developer Free Lives takes the idea of Buckshot Roulette and puts a brutal pill-popping spin on it. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Playable in solo against the NPC AI, or online for <em>up to</em> 4 players it's all about chugging down pills and often just hoping for the best since you don't exactly know which way the pills will swing for you. Sounds just like real life in some ways when it comes to medical issues. Only here, it's not about hoping the medication cures you - it's each player trying not to die while you're all strapped in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10035363291764253507gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Based on rounds, with each beginning by giving you a set of tools to pick from and then dropping a bunch of pills on the table for you to take turns ingesting them. You have two different types of health bars in this one to keep an eye on and manage. There's your actual health, and a resistance meter that acts like armour with zero resistance meaning potentially certain death as it will drop one of your hearts.</p>
<p>While a lot of it is down to chance on the pills you take, there is a certain amount of strategy to it with the various tools you get. There's a sweet that let's you skip a turn, a hammer to smash a pill so no one can take it, a tool to detect what a pill will do and more. You even get an injection that will swap the effects of a pill, if you're feeling real lucky. You can even mess with other players using pliers now and then to pull out their teeth, dropping their resistance down - especially useful if you wish to focus on taking someone out. Bit gruesome though. </p>
<p>As the rounds go on, new pill types are introduced with different effects and so you have more and more that will potentially end your life.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yYk0ra-5qVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dae2382c792678908f2d3ead8d62d920.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yYk0ra-5qVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The online mode is the same just with more players available via matchmaking or joining via lobby codes. So it's nice to see both options available, especially if you don't always have people available to play with. And in my case, only one key was supplied so I had to test it out playing against randoms. Thankfully, the online mode does appear to work quite well to be able to. It's missing a bunch of options though like how it has <em>no</em> chat of any sort - so half the time you're waiting for the lobby to fill as players keep popping in and out.</p>
<p>SIDE EFFECTS can get pretty intense, especially when you're running low on health and other players have items that you know they're going to be saving for you. But I can't help the feeling like it's just missing something, it feels a bit too slow at times while you're waiting for your turn. This is one where I feel it's pretty much <em>essential</em> that you play it with people you know to get the full enjoyment out of it. </p>
<p>It's as disturbing as it is interesting as an experimental game of risk and works just fine with Proton 10 on Linux.</p>
<p>At £4.29 it's an interesting cheap choice to add to your list of games to play with friends.</p>

      <title>According to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney - game stores don&#39;t need an AI label as it will be everywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the increasing amount of games using AI, Epic Game's Tim Sweeney believes the AI messages on stores like Steam make no sense.</p>
<p>Currently, if a game that's released on Steam uses generative AI in some way, it needs to be disclosed. Developers have to go through a content survey on their games to detail things like mature content and AI use. From Valve's own <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public rules</a> on it as a reminder first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your game used AI services during development or incorporates AI services as a part of the product, this section will require you to describe that implementation in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Generated:</strong> Any kind of content (art/code/sound/etc) created with the help of AI tools during development. Under the Steam Distribution Agreement, you promise Valve that your game will not include illegal or infringing content, and that your game will be consistent with your marketing materials. In our prerelease review, we will evaluate the output of AI generated content in your game the same way we evaluate all non-AI content - including a check that your game meets those promises.</li>
<li><strong>Live-Generated:</strong> Any kind of content created with the help of AI tools while the game is running. In addition to following the same rules as Pre-Generated AI content, this comes with an additional requirement - in the Content Survey, you'll need to tell us what kind of guardrails you're putting on your AI to ensure it's not generating illegal content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You've probably seen the notices buried at the bottom of Steam store pages, like this one for Stellaris from Paradox Interactive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:  We employ generative AI technologies during the creation of some assets. Typically this involves the ideation of content and visual reference material. These elements represent a minor component of the overall development. AI has been used to generate voices for an AI antagonist and a player advisor. " src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6433609421764249514gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Which you can make much bigger and clearer so you don't miss them with a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/the-useful-ai-warning-for-steam-script-has-been-turned-into-a-proper-browser-extension/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">browser plugin covered here on GamingOnLinux recently</a>.</p>
<p>Jumping into the discussion now is Epic Game's CEO Tim Sweeney, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> a reply to someone on X (Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Initial Post: Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the “Made with AI” label.  It doesn’t matter any more., reply from Tim Sweeney: Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14909659391764249647gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's no surprise that Sweeney is in favour of it, with games like Fortnite previously using AI like being able to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chat with Darth Vader</a>.</p>
<p>The situation with generative AI is evolving constantly, but even Sweeney here notes there are rights issues. To be more specific: a lot of the generative AI models used everywhere are trained on material without the permission of the original author of various works. There's been many lawsuits on it to the point that I don't think I need to rehash any of that here - they're all reported on constantly in depth elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even if it does end up everywhere, it's still a good thing to know <em>how</em> it's being used - isn't it? It's a discussion that swings wildly between camps. AI slop makers and people in favour of AI generation will naturally not want these types of notices and will fight against them, while the other side no doubt value seeing the notice to make more informed purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure - generative AI is complicating everything and companies are repeatedly enshittifying their products with generative AI, and it's going to continue on for some time.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the AI disclosures? Leave a comment.</p>

      <title>Cleared Hot is everything you could want in a modern twin-stick helicopter shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cleared Hot just entered Early Access from developer Not Knowing Corporation and MicroProse Software, and it's simply pure joy to blast through it. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>The game is not yet finished, so any true review will have to wait until later. But clearly they're onto something great here. Especially great for me, since I grew up playing the likes of Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and others in the series. This definitely feels like a much more modernised version, bringing twin-stick helicopter action to everyone who loves a good action game like this. With the addition of the physics system, there's some pretty funny things you can do in it too.</p>
<p>I was already impressed by the demo they previously released, and now thanks to the Early Access release there's just a whole lot more of it to play. Right now there's the desert area, but they have plans to expand the game's campaign into multiple other biomes including a jungle, artic and urban environments will will be interesting to see how the gameplay changes and evolves across each.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8vVEHjc-vBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4d7b185992666fb334e4fecb1016372.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8vVEHjc-vBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The physics system is the true highlight though, and one I hope they keep expanding as the game progresses during development. Being able to hook all sorts of random objects big and small, and throw them around to watch the chaos is just pure joy. Things get pretty messy in Cleared Hot, and it's the absurdity that the physics system brings that really makes it quite special and different to a few other attempts to modernise the classic helicopter combat games.</p>
<p>However, the physics system is a bit of a tease. Only certain types of objects can be picked up, I hope they adjust that to have more available. That, and the destruction system is great too, seeing towers and buildings crumble as you fire is great - but it needs more of that too as some don't at all.</p>
<p>Minor gripes aside, the atmosphere is fantastic. The audio is great, the voice over is fun and it all comes together quite nicely to really get you in the mood for flying.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Physics-Driven Mayhem</strong> - Everything moves, flies, and explodes with glorious realism - or at least plausible deniability.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Upgradeable Helicopters</strong> - Customize and upgrade your chopper to match your playstyle, from stealthy strikes to full-metal overkill.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rope &amp; Magnet Gameplay</strong> - Pick up (almost) anything - vehicles, enemies, barrels, even your dignity - and weaponize the environment.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tactical Squad Support</strong> - Deploy your troops, capture objectives, and provide covering fire - just try not to “accidentally” drop them.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day &amp; Night Missions</strong> - Adapt to shifting light conditions using night vision or thermal optics to keep the advantage.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Creative Destruction</strong> - Physics means freedom - clear obstacles, sling debris, and improvise your way through every mission.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">A few things are currently missing from it like cloud saves but they're working on it. That, and they have plans soonish to get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified too as it's currently only listed as Playable, which is mainly due to some small text sizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Unfortunately, there is one issue on Linux with Valve's official Proton. Some little video clips will <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-some-games-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck-have-broken-videos-and-what-you-can-do/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">give you a test screen instead of the video</a> which is the same issue I saw recently with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sektori-is-absolutely-one-of-the-best-modern-twin-stick-shooters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sektori</a>. A common codec issue that the developer will need to solve, but until then you can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">use GE-Proton</a> to get the game working fully. I've given feedback to the developer on this. Apart from that, all fine with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It only arrived on November 20th and already has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. Awesome.</p>

      <title>Valve release small Proton Experimental update for ARC Raiders, Uno and Far Cry 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from a bigger <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-experimental-for-steamos-linux-gets-fixes-for-marvel-rivals-blazblue-centralfiction-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Experimental update for Linux / SteamOS last week</a>, a smaller bug-fix update has rolled out for the Windows compatibility tool. This is just to clear up a few pesky issues people have encountered.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the changes for the November 26th update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Xalia not interacting correctly with dialogs produced by ARC Raiders.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression that caused games like Uno and Far Cry 4 to not start.</li>
<li>Fixed voice line playback in Rigid Force Alpha.</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Note: Xalia is what Valve use for adding gamepad support to desktop applications like launchers and dialog boxes that may pop up from games.</p>

<em>Pictured - ARC Raiders</em></p>
<p>How to get it: the update will show up in your Steam Downloads for Proton Experimental if you have it installed already. Otherwise, it will automatically download if you go to play a game that Valve has set for Proton Experimental by default. Or, you can manually search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it and try it on some games.

<p>ICYMI: Valve also recently release the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huge Proton 10 update</a>.</p>

      <title>The excellent Yet Another Zombie Survivors is finally Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yet Another Zombie Survivors is one of the best suvivor-likes for its mixture of great action and fun features, and it's finally Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It worked well for a while, and especially well on Desktop Linux with Proton, but needed various tweaks for the smaller handheld screen so this latest update will be great for other handhelds too. Valve have bumped it up from Playable since the latest update with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released Proton 10</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19740723511764239973gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The most recent update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To improve readability on smaller screens, the size of many texts and pop-ups has been increased.</li>
<li>HUD Scale (50%-150%) setting was added to the "Interface" tab in the Options menu.</li>
<li>Added some additional safeguards against potential save corruption (no amount of it is enough).</li>
<li>"Bricklayer" enemy projectiles slowed down by 15% &amp; improved indicator visibility.</li>
<li>Added new VFX particles to the game when "Blood and gore" setting is turned off.</li>
<li>The game now launches with a 60 FPS cap before it fully loads the limit set by the user.</li>
<li>Fix for "Reserve Bench" item not working correctly when equipped with "Gold Medal".</li>
<li>Mechanic: Trusty Spanner: Melee range increased slightly.</li>
<li>"Privacy Mode" setting moved to the user interface tab in the Options.</li>
<li>Fix for gameplay time displaying wrongly on the Save Slot UI.</li>
<li>Display &amp; control improvements for Run History interfaces.</li>
<li>Other interface-related improvements and tweaks.</li>
<li>Fixes for some other minor errors.</li>

      <title>Death Stranding 2 looks set for a PC release - hopefully sometime soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINALLY. We can see that Death Stranding 2 is coming to PC thanks to a leak from a ratings board. The wait may be almost over, and just in time as I've gotten the partner to give the first game a download to join me in loving it.</p>
<p>The data comes from the ESRB, in a now-deleted post that we can see thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251126052558/https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. Whenever it arrives, it will be a day-1 purchase from me to play on my Fedora KDE install. Perhaps we might even be graced with a release date during The Game Awards, which wouldn't be a surprise since Hideo Kojima has been there a few times in previous years.</p>
<p>Sony games often come to PC a good while (a year or more) after the PlayStation release (apart from Helldivers 2), but we're not even close to a year since Death Stranding 2 originally released so perhaps they are speeding this one up a bit.</p>
<p>Exciting times!</p>
<p>Here's the original PS5 trailer if you want to see it again or for the first time:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EQdOSTt7YpY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc347ca4c3d8ded5ce85cd67c9931ced.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EQdOSTt7YpY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With such a huge game, the biggest issue will be how Proton will run it. However, Valve have made such massive improvements since the original released - so hopefully we won't run into any trouble. GamingOnLinux will let you know either way shortly after release.</p>

      <title>s&amp;box from Rust developer Facepunch is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>s&amp;box from Rust developer Facepunch is a modern game engine built on Valve's Source 2 and the latest .NET, and now it is open source! Quite a big surprise and it's using a proper permissive license too (MIT).</p>
<p>Facepunch say s&amp;box is a "spiritual successor to Garry’s Mod and a love letter to Source 2". So it's a mixture of a game engine, and a platform to launch and play games. A bit of an all in one solution, a little like Roblox too in that way.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://sbox.game/news/update-25-11-26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official site they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously this isn't the Source 2 code, that's up to Valve to open source if they want. For us Source 2 is providing lower level systems, all our high level systems are C# like the entire editor, networking, scene system, UI, and way more..</p>
<p>What this means is you can view, modify, copy any of our code to help improve s&amp;box with pull requests, or maintain your own fork for your standalone games, or even just take the code for your own engine.</p>
<p>It might seem odd from a business perspective to make an engine and give it away for free with no royalties and to give all the code away under open source. But we're a bunch of nerds that love what we're creating, we want everyone to use it in whatever way they want, we want to provide opportunities.</p>
<p>Open source is great for the game dev ecosystem, engines like Godot are awesome, we should have more of it because everyone wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with basically all of that. Open source is awesome and it's nice to see another major developer get on board.</p>
<p>They also recently <a href="https://sbox.game/metrics/finance" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">opened up</a> their finances to the public to see, which is a really interesting step as well. Allowing anyone to go look at how much s&amp;box pulls in, and how much is being paid out to creators. Love seeing things like that too.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing to see them do all this. It doesn't mean s&amp;box will get Native Linux support though, as even if someone submitted code for it - they don't have to accept it. But what it does mean is anyone can fork it and turn it into something else, learn from it and even improve how it runs in Proton as developers can see exactly what it's doing.</p>
<p>You can find the open source code on <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-public" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Sektori is absolutely one of the best modern twin-stick shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sektori blasted onto Steam recently and I've been absolutely loving it, this is easily one of the best modern twin-stick shooters and fantastic to play. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>If you've ever played and enjoyed anything like Geometry Wars, this is an absolute must-buy. This is what you want in a modern take on the genre that just feels incredible to play and smash through all the enemies. It will fry your brain just as much as your eyes, as the action truly gets intense. </p>
<p>The campaign mode is especially incredible with the way the battlefield changes as you go through. You start off with a small space, that gradually morphs into different shaped arenas as you progress through it. The floor lights up giving you a warning on where it will change, and then it all smashes into play with the new shape. No level loading interruptions, it's all action and no filler here. One you have to experience to get the full feel for it, especially with the thumping techno music that give it a thrilling atmosphere for the challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5512223331764177344gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5512223331764177344gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4761958371764177342gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4761958371764177342gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With an in-battle upgrade system the way it all just keeps the game continuously flowing is incredible. As you destroy enemies you'll see big flashy upgrade tokens to collect which you can spend across boosts like speed, score, shields, your blaster and so on. But here's the interesting bit, the upgrades are in a list where collecting more changes what you will be upgrading - so you can choose to upgrade speed which is at the bottom or collect more tokens to upgrade your blaster which is at the top. All while you're flying around shooting, blasting through enemies and dashing to get away from them. It's true chaos of the best sort. </p>
<p>You also evolve your ship during battle through special evolver tokens, which you pick from a stack that you have unlocked to give you more powerful bonuses like giving you drones to help, repelling enemy bullets, fire bullets behind you and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yGWsLyZ0KPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/287583a4d8056118c21081d304cda8ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yGWsLyZ0KPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The style of it too is seriously slick. With bright neon colours surrounding you, and simple but effective 3D geometric shapes for the enemies - it looks spectacular with the way enemies drop down onto the battlefield too. Everything about it is just so wonderfully designed.</p>
<p>From the press release: “Sektori is an evolution of the classic twin-stick shooter, offering a mix of randomization with deliberate strategy as you decide when to cash in your points for power-ups,” said developer Kimmo Lahtinen. “It’s classic arcade action with a smidge of roguelike DNA with the ability to spec your ship differently in each run. It’s easy to have fun right out of the gate, but there’s infinite room for improvement as you aim to tackle higher difficulties, climb the leaderboards, or just beat your own personal best attempts! But most importantly, I wanted to focus on game feel, with kaleidoscopic colors and pulsating techno beats that lock you into a hypnotic flow state.”</p>
<p>On Linux there is <em>one</em> specific issue with Proton. The backing video behind the menu and battlefield is broken on Valve's official Proton. For it to work properly, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you'll need GE-Proton</a>. Other than that, no issues at all and it took me a while to even notice that was actually an issue until it suddenly clicked that I was sometimes seeing the <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9489981491764176915gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton test image behind</a> the scenes. Goes to show how <em>intense</em> the action is that I didn't even notice it initially. But for the full experience, you <em>definitely</em> want GE-Proton until perhaps they can use a different video codec for it.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of twin-stick shooters this is an <strong>essential</strong> pick. Absolutely brilliant.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma going all-in on Wayland and will drop the X11 session completely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time but it's nearly upon us - KDE Plasma with version 6.8 will be entirely dropping the X11 session to go full Wayland.</p>
<p>For a lot of users it won't make much of a difference, according to the <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/11/26/going-all-in-on-a-wayland-future/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcement as the "vast majority of our users are already using the Wayland session". With this change they said it "opens up new opportunities for features, optimizations, and speed of development". Not surprising, since developing for and maintaining the Plasma desktop across two very different protocols can't be easy. At least they'll end up with more focused development. </p>
<p>So with this move support for all X11 applications will be "fully entrusted to Xwayland".</p>
<p>In the FAQ they mentioned the current Plasma X11 session will be supported still into early 2027, no exact timing as of yet though. If you really need X11, they're suggesting sticking to a long term support (LTS) distribution that ships older Plasma. If you are using X11 and sticking with it a while, the good news is that KDE applications will continue to run on X11. They're only dropping support specifically for the Plasma desktop itself.</p>
<p>There's still some <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland_Known_Significant_Issues" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant issues</a> they need to address though, which they're gradually working through to ensure Plasma on Wayland is truly good for everyone.</p>
<p><em>We're finally properly close to the year of Wayland on the desktop.</em></p>

<p>The base model has 16GB RAM and a 500GB NVMe storage drive. For ports you get 2x USB-C USB3.2 Gen1 with PD3.0 charging and 4K@60Hz video output, and 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen1.</p>
<p>Priced at €1,098.99 but it's €70 off for Black Friday bringing it down to €1,029. The pricing actually seems <em>reasonable</em> for the specifications, at least to me scanning around a little bit and seeing pricing from other vendors.</p>

      <title>Fedora proposal put forward to improve &#34;production stability and incident management&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a string of annoying incidents after updates causing stability problems on Fedora, there's a new proposal put forward to help improve things.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/proposal-a-sig-to-improve-production-stability-and-incident-management/174907" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new proposal</a> suggests forming a Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on developing a "recommended stream of work to improve our stability and robustness, and to improve our communication with users when problems arise that compromise that stability and robustness".</p>
<p>In the proposal several major update issues are noted that have come up lately including a recent Mesa update that broke launching games from Steam. I only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hello-from-fedora-kde/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switched to Fedora KDE a few days ago</a>, and was bitten by the Mesa update, and so I was forced into the terminal to downgrade my Mesa version just to get gaming with friends that evening - something that ideally just <em>shouldn't</em> happen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chatter</a> on the Fedora Discourse forum around the Mesa update got a little <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/21" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spicy</a>, with the maintainer who actually pushed out this particular Mesa update noting they "don’t consider closed source steam a reliable indicator of issues, it has no debug symbols" which was pretty <em>unhelpful</em>. And later <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/51" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> "Not my problem anymore, I have quit as rpmfusion admin".</p>
<p>Seems like the proposal is a good idea, at least to get the ball rolling on things. Their update process currently doesn't seem to work particularly well at times. This isn't about playing a blame game as issues happen of course, but so many issues <em>could</em> be avoided with better processes in place. A system cannot be (as the Fedora websites advertises) "Trusted, powerful and easy" and "Reliable" if updates repeatedly break major parts of the system.</p>
<p>Hopefully some good improvements can come out of this.</p>

      <title>The action RPG &#39;Soulframe&#39; from the devs of Warframe gets a Steam page and early access for founders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not officially out yet, but you can now jump in early to Soulframe, the in-development action RPG from the developers of the popular Warframe. A Steam page is also now live that you can follow it on, for whenever it actually releases properly. Considering it's from the Warframe developers, I expect it to be another big one.</p>
<p>Not heard of it? An open world fantasy RPG adventure with themes influenced by nature and restoration. With a hand-crafted world you will explore an "ancient, broken land and inherit the courage, spirit, and grace of Ancestors to mend earthly flesh and heal its land from Ode’n reign".</p>
<p>Announced on the <a href="https://forums.soulframe.com/topic/6643-soulframe-preludes-12-wylds/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official forum</a>, founder packs for it are also now live so you can purchase it to get into it early. Until now, you had to sign up for a chance to be invited via email, so you can skip all that if you really want to get in on it during development. It's not cheap though, as getting all three of the characters appears to be £84.99 with them £24.99 individually and you get an assortment of extras with them too. <em>At release much like Warframe, it will be free to play.</em></p>
<p>There's also a new trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3OTXsgACvIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5643bf5fbf16e08087239c6a65eb0b18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3OTXsgACvIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:  "Warframe would not still be going strong 12 years later without those who supported us at its early foundations," said Geoff Crookes, Creative Director. "Soulframe Founders is us planting some of our biggest roots yet for the future. We've now reached the phase of development where we can welcome people in to help turn those roots into a solid foundation and build something we've all been waiting and hoping for from the ground up. We promise to continue serving this new community for as long as they allow us to, and to install the themes of redemption and hope throughout every aspect of Soulframe. Thank you for joining us."</p>

      <title>Heck yeah - the next HELLDIVERS 2 Warbond finally brings a minigun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 is still one of the best online co-op action games around, and we're finally going to be able to get a minigun to really tear through enemies.</p>
<p>Not only that, there's going to be a chainsaw too and it looks amazing. Not enough for you? Well there's also a new drone sidekick with a flamethrower, which will probably cause all sorts of friendly-fire chaos I imagine. On top of that there's a new primary weapon that's a combo between an assault rifle and grenade launcher too.</p>
<p>This will come with the premium (paid) Python Commandos Premium Warbond which arrives on December 2nd, which is perfect timing as I've just started getting back into the game after a long time away from it. And, with their new focus on improving the core stability of the game - it's all coming together now.</p>
<p>Probably one of the best sounding warbonds they've added to the game since release. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QQPp9ZCgrP8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f47d903f39e2d4b84d9671672e70ce4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QQPp9ZCgrP8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 continues working quite nicely on Linux with Proton, although annoyingly with my two monitors the mouse does like to wander off onto my second screen at times.</p>
<p>Even with the nProtect GameGuard anti-cheat, it works fine and has done with it since release. That and more noted on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> for Linux / SteamOS.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group have announced they're once again shrinking, after previously going on a crazy spending spree and then having to make lots of cuts. This time they've announced they're selling off Arc Games and Cryptic Studios which will both go to Project Golden Arc, Inc., with financing from XD Inc.</p>
<p>From the press release: "This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow. The deal also allows online multiplayer game Fellowship, developed by a talented external team in Stockholm, to find a great home within Coffee Stain Group. I would like to thank the teams at Arc and Cryptic for their hard work over the past four years and wish them all the best as we are confident they will thrive and develop in the years ahead,” says Phil Rogers, CEO of Embracer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19558700191764153458gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19558700191764153458gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fellowship</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Embracer will keep some of the rights including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The publishing rights for the Remnant franchise which will go to the Embracer-owned THQ Nordic.</li>
<li>The rights to Fellowship will move to Coffee Stain <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-rebrand-as-fellowship-entertainment-and-release-76-games-in-the-next-year/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which is being spun off from Embracer</a>. Developer Chief Rebel will continue on with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deal isn't done yet, and no date was mentioned on when they expect it to all finish, Embracer simply said "Closing of the transaction is expected to take place as soon as customary conditions are fulfilled".</p>

      <title>Cold Fear, I Am Alive and more arrive in the GOG Preservation Program along with a Black Friday sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those that prefer the DRM-free store <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, they've expanded again with new enhanced releases of Cold Fear and I Am Alive along with a Black Friday sale. You can check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Guide to get GOG games on Linux / SteamOS</a>.</p>
<p>About restoring <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cold_fear" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cold Fear</a>, the GOG team said: "Originally published by Ubisoft and now re-released by Atari with our very own restoration efforts, Cold Fear represents the kind of behind-the-scenes cooperation that helps ensure cult titles don’t quietly fade away when technology moves on. If a game is part of our shared gaming heritage, it deserves more than to be left broken on modern hardware". They also mentioned how it has new support for "robust controller support for popular pads, unified button layouts, and full support for wireless play, hotplugging, D-Pads, triggers, and vibration, all based on an updated scheme inspired by the original PlayStation 2 controls" along with various other enhancements to fix up glitches, crashes and so on.</p>

<p>They also revamped <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/i_am_alive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">I Am Alive</a> a little for their store that also had a whole bunch of improvements.</p>

      <title>TRX an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 version 1.0 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With lots of enhancements for the classics Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2, the TRX project version 1.0 is out now with an LUA scripting engine for modders.</p>
<p>So what exactly is TRX? It aims to enhance the classic Tomb Raiders games through decompilation and the implementation of open-source alternatives to proprietary components. TRX is a single engine capable of running TR1, TR2, and custom levels respecting each of the distinct, classic engines' mechanics.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 was released November 23rd bringing the two games together under one roof, and with a new LUA scripting engine that could be really fun for modders to do all sorts with the game. There's absolutely tons more that was added into this release like improved rendering, support for triangular geometry, support for additive blending in textures, a new easter egg command for TR1, support for TR2 weapons in TR1 and so much more.</p>
<p>You can see their release video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vVU9vbUXTXc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2976a2866c6d26873ab3bbb1a721d02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vVU9vbUXTXc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see everything in the <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases/tag/trx-1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all that's new in the 1.0 update.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is a thing of course, but projects like this being open source can keep the classics running basically forever and on more platforms. You need the original data files from the games to work with TRX which you can grab from <a class="gol298" href="https://gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a class="gol644" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior shows off a new prototype trailer of the heavy metal platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio continue working on Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior a retro-styled heavy metal platformer in partnership with the band Voivod.</p>
<p>Following on from the successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, they say it has now moved onto "full production" with the new trailer showcasing the game's evolving world: a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape where mechanical ruins meet cosmic horror, brought to life through hand-crafted pixel art and an original soundtrack shaped by Voivod's unmistakable sound.</p>
<p>From the PR: "Our goal is to make a game that feels like stepping inside a Voivod album cover," says Nicola Piovesan, the game’s director and founder of Chaosmonger Studio. "This new trailer captures the atmosphere and energy that define the band’s universe. It’s both a tribute and a continuation of their legacy."</p>
<p>See the new prototype trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K_Ey26szgM4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0193d02d23624e9b5876bbf80a44180.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K_Ey26szgM4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the PR: "The result is a unique creative synthesis: a metal-infused interactive experience where music, art, and storytelling merge into a single audiovisual vision. Combining classic run-and-gun gameplay with exploration and atmosphere, Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior invites players to embody the Voivod himself — a mutant warrior guided by his disembodied mind, Nothingface — on a journey through twisted dimensions inspired by the band’s albums and mythos."</p>
<p>It's due out sometime next year.</p>
