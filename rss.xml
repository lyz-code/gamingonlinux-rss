      <title>SteamOS 3.4 rolls out in Beta for the Steam Deck - it&#39;s a massive upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has done another weekend drop here, with a Beta version of SteamOS 3.4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3383920059429575957" target="_blank">now available</a> for the Steam Deck. This is easily one of the biggest updates they've done to the system since release, and there's so many changes that improve the experiences across the whole device.</p>
<p>This includes massive upgrades to the Desktop Mode, an upgraded Arch Linux package base, the performance overlay was changed for Level 2 to show the details along the top of the screen instead of going down the left, external drive upgrades and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>New style of Level 2 for the Performance Overlay:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12409952431668247579gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12409952431668247579gol1.jpeg"/></a>Looking good!</em></p>
<p>Currently SteamOS 3.4 is using kernel 5.13 (with various Valve patches) and Mesa 22.2.0.</p>
<p>Words and pictures are great but here's a video showcasing some of the changes:</p>

      <title>WW1 shooter Isonzo gets performance improvements for the Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>M2H and BlackMill Games have released another update to the WW1 shooter Isonzo, this time it's better news for the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Along with their continued updates improving various parts of the game, as it did launch in a bit of a buggy state, although enjoyable they mentioned "Linux performance improvements" were part of this patch so if you're sticking with the Native Linux build you might have a better time now.</p>
<p>Since I last tried it, I have some other good news. They seem to have fixed shadows on the Native Linux build on NVIDIA GPUs too so everything isn't blindingly bright.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8031301771668176970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8031301771668176970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It does indeed seem to perform quite a bit better too!</p>
<p>The full patch notes are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New and improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved animations for the Fiat Revelli</li>
<li>New first person bashing animation variants for pistols</li>
<li>New first person stabbing animation variants for bayonets</li>
<li>Improved speed and animation timing for melee attacks in first person</li>
<li>Player is now slightly higher in first person</li>
<li>Split Player tags and World tags visibility settings</li>
<li>Improvements to mortar aiming visibility</li>
<li>Improved info panels for mortar and overview map</li>
<li>Linux performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed players sometimes appearing like they are from the wrong team and therefore could be killed by teammates</li>
<li>Bots no longer use Static weapons if enemies are too far away</li>
<li>Headgear no longer clips through the gas mask</li>
<li>Fixed Villar Perosa sound or muzzle flash sometimes missing in third person</li>
<li>Fixed LMGs continuing to auto-fire while crawling</li>
<li>Fixed full-auto firing animations not always playing in sync with fire rate</li>
<li>Fixed animation snapping at the end of bayonet stab and revolver bash</li>
<li>Fix for field guns animation snapping when first deploying to one on a slope</li>
<li>Fixed fingers clipping through binoculars when looking through them</li>
<li>Fixed Werndl cocking bone not setting when interrupting reloads</li>
<li>Fixed bridge explosions replaying after switching graphics settings</li>
<li>Corrected size of some pistols and flareguns</li>
<li>Fixed Allow voice chat option not resetting to default</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect names for Gorizia and Sabotino Capzones</li>
<li>Sector outlines are now red when in cooldown</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong marksman perk localization for some languages</li>
<li>Ghost players</li>
<li>Voice keybinds are sometimes not remembered on the spawn map</li>
</ul>

      <title>Call of the Wild: The Angler gets updated to fix the launch crash on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Call of the Wild: The Angler from developer Expansive Worlds launched on Steam on August 31, and sadly it was broken but now they've fixed it. This is the same team that made the rather good theHunter: Call of the Wild, and while it hasn't been reviewing as well it's still good to see it getting updated.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, it would just crash during launch. In Hotfix version 1.1.2, they said "It aims to fix the issues Steam Deck users were encountering when trying to launch the game. We knew how important it was for Deck players and we appreciate the patience you've shown while we worked on a solution.".</p>
<p>Additionally they seem to plan further improvements as they also said "While this is not full Steam Deck support yet, we're currently looking into making The Angler fully compatible with Valve's handheld in the future."</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/call-of-the-wild-the-angler?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1408610/Call_of_the_Wild_The_Angler/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>A Plague Tale: Requiem gets Steam Deck support in a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck by Valve, A Plague Tale: Requiem from Focus Entertainment and Asobo Studio has a new update out to help.</p>
<p>Going by various reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1182900" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, it was possible to play it, but it wasn't a great experience so hopefully this update actually improves things as they claim.</p>
<p>They didn't go into any real specifics (annoyingly) on what's actually changed other than now being "compatible" with the Steam Deck. The full <a href="https://forums.focus-entmt.com/topic/64215/patch-notes-update-09-11-22" target="_blank">patch notes</a> are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patch Notes common to all platforms</strong><br/>
<u>Changes &amp; Updates</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Balanced difficulty in “Nothing Left” and “Dying Sun” final arena fights.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Optimization</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized AI, rats, terrain and navmesh to reduce framerate drops and freezing issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bug Fixes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HDR issues creating crushed highlights (not applicable to Nintendo Switch).</li>
<li>Fixed random crashes or blockers that could happen in some chapters.</li>
<li>Fixed blockers or animation bugs that could happen during some crank interactions.</li>
<li>Fixed issue during reaction between Ignifer pot and Odoris in specific cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a script issue that could make the pine cones thrown by Hugo in “Under a New Sun” invisible.</li>
<li>Improved cart collisions to prevent going out of the map.</li>
<li>Fixed minor visual bugs in some chapters.</li>
<li>Fixed unexpected change of audio language when changing other options.</li>
<li>Fixed minor issues in German language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Notes specific to PC</strong><br/>
<u>Changes &amp; Updates</u></p>
<ul>
<li>The game is now compatible with Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Optimization</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new graphics options to improve visual and performance customizations (Frame limiter, Resolution optimizer, SSAO, DOF, Screen Space Shadows, Motion Blur).</li>
<li>Improved auto setting graphic profiles to better match PC configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bug Fixes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed specular flickering issues with DLSS.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's likely with the optimizations they did, along with the graphics options settings, they're now setting them at sane defaults for the Steam Deck to make it have an acceptable performance level. An educated guess, but most likely what they've done. Still good to see even more developers actually fix things directly for the Steam Deck like this.</p>

      <title>Tetris Effect: Connected gets some fixes for Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/" target="_blank">Tetris Effect: Connected</a>, the reinvention of one of the most popular puzzle games of all time, has a big new update out that should solve some Linux and Steam Deck problems.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://twitter.com/parkerreed/status/1565097500293210113" target="_blank">pointed out</a> to me a while ago, that for some reason the developers had locked out the ability to change the game resolution when playing it through Proton. This seemed to affect people playing in desktop mode, docked to a monitor and on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it was a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1003590/discussions/0/3492004456593230612/" target="_blank">bug</a> and it has now been sorted.</p>
<p>From the V1.3.3 <a href="https://www.tetriseffect.game/2022/11/10/all-platforms-patch-1-3-3/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[STEAM DECK] Added support for selecting your LOCATION on a Steam Deck.  If you have not set your LOCATION yet, the setting screen will pop up when you select EFFECT MODES or MULTIPLAYER &gt; RANKED MATCH. This setting can now also be changed in OPTIONS &gt; GAMEPLAY &gt; LOCATION.</p>
<p>[STEAM DECK] Added support to change the GAME RESOLUTION settings on a Steam Deck when docked to a monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see developers pay attention and improve Steam Deck / Linux with their games. They even did their own Steam Deck video a while ago on it:</p>

      <title>Stadia refunds are starting to begin, no word on Controller Bluetooth yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google has announced that they've now begun the process to refund years of Stadia game purchases, as the service is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/google-gives-up-on-stadia-will-offer-refunds-on-games-and-hardware/" target="_blank">shutting down</a>.</p>
<p>In the updated FAQ entry, Google noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting 9 November 2022, Stadia will attempt to automatically process refunds for all purchases of games, add-on content and subscription fees other than Stadia Pro made through the Stadia Store. We ask for your patience as we work through each transaction and ask that you refrain from contacting customer support as they will not be able to expedite your refund during this time. We still expect the majority of refunds to be processed by 18 January 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google said if you don't have a Google account now, they will still process the refund. If there are any card issues (lost / stolen / new card), you should at some point receive an email giving you instructions on how to still get your Stadia refund. They also said some people may need to sign up with Payoneer to get their refund, in some special cases where they cannot process it directly.</p>
<p>The same date has been given for Hardware purchases which include the Stadia Controller, Founder's Edition, Premiere Edition and Play and Watch with Google TV packages but you keep the hardware after the refund.</p>
<p>Sadly though, it seems there's still no update on them enabling Bluetooth in the Stadia Controller so it's wired-only which is a pretty big shame if they don't do it. It's a really comfy controller to use but they are under no obligation to enable Bluetooth, since they're refunding the hardware completely. <em>At least I own a bit of weird computing history now…</em></p>
<p>As for moving progress from Stadia to elsewhere they said that <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575922767593078793%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575818132492636162%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">I/O Interactive</a>, <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsColourTV/status/1582853316727275522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582853316727275522%7Ctwgr%5Eafc6ee3e194990b1733f7c6ec8cea5cefe606d5f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Frockstarintel.com%2Frockstar-games-announced-transfer-progression-for-red-dead-online-stadia-players" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/10/20/elder-scrolls-online-stadia/" target="_blank">Bethesda</a> have already shared plans on that but it's down to each developer and publisher to sort it.</p>

      <title>dbrand issued an update on Killswitch replacements, Dock compatibility and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the recent issue dbrand had with their <a href="https://dbrand.com/killswitch" target="_blank">Killswitch</a> magnets causing issues with some Steam Deck fans, they've issued an update on how it's going and other changes due to Dock compatibility.</p>
<p>Firstly, for the Killswitch Case redesign, it sounds like it's going well. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yrryt8/project_killswitch_dock_compatibility_and_more/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they showed off some fresh pictures of the new lock design without magnets, along with an upgraded kickstand that now includes Micro SD card holder slots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1819318081668166975gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1819318081668166975gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699528481668166976gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699528481668166976gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13414741071668166977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13414741071668166977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the kickstand they say is now "10% lighter" too.</p>
<p>When to expect them? They are on target for January 2023.</p>
<p>Remember when they said reservations would get free Portal Stick Grips that didn't happen? They apologised and said they've now had time to make more so if you did place the reservation and ordered, they will be sending them out.</p>
<p>The other subject is Docking Station compatibility. The Killswitch Case does not fit in a lot of docks, like the official Valve dock. So they're now going to be doing a USB-C extender so you can actually plug it in and a low-profile plastic "bucket" that serves as an adapter so it can actually sit in the dock with the case on. dbrand said they are not aiming to make a profit on those, as they will be "priced according to parts and labor" and that anyone who received the older magnetic version of the case would get them free in the upcoming reshipment of the new case. For everyone else, you can buy them standalone or add them to your order.</p>
<p>Here's how the USB-C extender and bucket look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12004355141668166977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12004355141668166977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The bucket looks fine but wow that USB-C extender sure does look ugly and out of place, they probably can't make it much shorter though so it will have to do.</p>
<p>I do find it odd they only posted this on Reddit, and not in an email to actual customers though. I guess they assume they will reach most people there but if you don't go on Reddit, you would miss it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta improves on-screen keyboard and offline mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two areas that could use some love are being tweaked, with a new Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3383920059425809022" target="_blank">available now</a> with various fixes and upgrades. This is available in Beta and Preview. To change over you can find it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Offline Mode especially has been a nuisance for a lot of people, just not working as expected in many areas so it's nice to see Valve make some more fixes there too.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed downloads page crashing when starting in offline mode</li>
<li>Downloads page now properly responds to online/offline status</li>
<li>Virtual Keyboard now has a maximum width, so that it doesn't stretch to an unusable size on large screens in Docked mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Desktop Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue preventing the Virtual Keyboard from accessing the clipboard and being able to perform paste operations</li>
<li>Fixed duplicate dialogs (e.g. uninstall dialog) after opening the standalone keyboard or controller configurator</li>
<li>Fixed regression where Browse Local Files was no longer working</li>
<li>Fixed circular download progress indicator being broken in game entry list</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the library UI would not render in offline mode</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where custom artwork and local screenshots were not found when running with -newbigpicture</li>
<li>Fixed issue where transitioning from Desktop =&gt; BPM =&gt; Desktop would cause the Friends List to be signed out</li>
<li>Fixed issue where advanced display settings were not visible outside of the Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the old Big Picture Mode was started when the checkbox in Settings =&gt; Interface specified that Big Picture Mode should be the startup UI, even though -newbigpicture was specified.</li>
<li>Fixed Virtual Keyboard not working properly when brought up manually or by automatically by the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve are also being odd with Deck Verified again. They've recently moved Battlefield 1 from Playable to Unsupported, even though on Proton Experimental it works amazingly well and I only just recently did a video (below) to show it off and I was really impressed by it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="esHemt9SSQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/590e52f8f39a7de87d451d48efe52a8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/esHemt9SSQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Valve did the same for It Takes Two, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and other EA games. So it's quite likely this is as a result of the recent switch from Origin to the EA app, despite them already fixing it in Proton Experimental — something they seem to have no problem setting by default for other games. I'm going to put this down to some sort of Deck Verified testing issue that isn't taking Proton Experimental into account.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 525.53 Beta is out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, it's your time to test something new. NVIDIA have released a Beta driver with <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194315/en-uk" target="_blank">version 525.53</a>.</p>
<p>As always with anything with a Beta tag: here be dragons. It may have issues that will be solved in the next Stable release, so if you want a solid experience stick to your current drivers. It's not usually too long before NVIDIA drivers go from Beta to Stable.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Dynamic Boost to not engage on certain Ampere GPU based notebooks.</li>
<li>Added support for Dynamic Boost on notebooks with AMD CPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in stutter when moving windows in GNOME.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless extension.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent the creation of display layouts that exceed hardware size limitations when using the SLI Mosaic configuration page, and to display a warning if such a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.</li>
<li>Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2 only, GTK 3 only, or both GTK 2 and GTK 3.</li>
<li>Updated the open kernel modules to support Quadro Sync, Stereo, rotation in X11, and YUV 4:2:0 on Turing.</li>
<li>Updated an error message that nvidia-installer displays when kernel header files cannot be found to print full paths for the missing files.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to use "command -v" in place of depending on "which" to determine the availability and location of certain tools.</li>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
<ul>
<li>* VK_KHR_acceleration_structure<br/>
* VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_query<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline<br/>
* VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur<br/>
* VK_NVX_binary_import<br/>
* VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules will now be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in geometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to correctly limit the allowed values for GPUTargetFanSpeed to match the existing valid fan speed ranges for supported NVIDIA GPUs. The valid ranges are 30%-100% for Ampere or newer GPUs, and 1%-100% for older GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vulkan-based D3D9, 10 and 11 translation layer DXVK version 2.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a>, the translation layer that converts Direct3D calls to Vulkan for use with Wine and Proton, has a big new release out with <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.0" target="_blank">version 2.0</a>. This is one of the ways that Proton performs so well for Windows games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For this, you will need to ensure you have up to date drivers, they said any Vulkan 1.3 capable driver and Wine version are required now. The new recommend versions are:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Driver</th>
<th>Required version</th>
<th>Recommended version</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AMD (RADV)</td>
<td>22.0</td>
<td><strong>22.2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nvidia</td>
<td>510.47.03</td>
<td><strong>520.56.06</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intel (ANV)</td>
<td>22.0</td>
<td><strong>22.2</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As for what's new? A lot! As expected from a major version bump.</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, that provides Vulkan support for Native Linux applications has now been upstreamed and merged into DXVK directly so that it "can be used as a drop-in replacement to port D3D applications without having to change rendering code". This is really great and for developers who are looking to port their games, it's breaking down another barrier.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting changes is to shader compiling. Unless games already have their shaders ready, like you see in Steam when it downloads them for you, there will often be a lot of stuttering as the game builds it up with DXVK as you play. That's now changed! If you have drivers that support what's needed, the "shaders will now be compiled at the time the game loads its D3D shaders, rather than at draw time" resulting in reduced or eliminated shader compile stutter. There's some caveats with this though like some games only loading their shaders as you play anyway, 32-bit games may stutter and NVIDIA uses more space.</p>
<p><em>I cannot stress how excited I am for the above on both Steam Deck and Linux desktop!</em></p>
<p>Other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>D3D9</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the likelihood of running out of address space in 32-bit D3D9 games</li>
<li>Reading from an active render target in D3D9 games is now properly supported, which previously caused rendering artifacts on newer AMD hardware and required driver-level workarounds. This affects a number of games, including GTA IV.</li>
<li>The D3D9 alpha test implementation was changed to more closely match the behaviour of Nvidia's implementation, which fixes inaccuracies in various games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D3D10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removal of some unused bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D3D11</strong>
<ul>
<li>DXVK now exposes D3D11 Feaure Level 12_1 with the following newly added features:
<ul>
<li>Tiled Resources up to <strong>Tier 3</strong>, provided that the corresponding Vulkan sparse binding and sparse residency features are supported</li>
<li>Conservative Rasterization up to <strong>Tier 3</strong>, provided that the corresponding Vulkan conservative rasterization features are supported.</li>
<li>Rasterizer Ordered Views, provided that the corresponding Vulkan fragment shader interlock features are supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closer to Windows behaviour for "immediate contexts and deferred contexts", might help "improve compatibility to third-party libraries and mods that hook into the D3D11 immediate context specifically, and reduces CPU overhead since some frequently used code paths are now more specialized for each context type".</li>
<li>More optimizations to reduce CPU overhead in games like Assassin's Creed: Origins and God of War.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also numerous game-specific bug fixes including issues solved for: Alan Wake, Alice Madness Returns, Anomaly: Warzone Earth, Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon Age Origins, Empire: Total War, Final Fantasy XV, Grand Theft Auto IV, Heroes Of Annihilated Empires, King Of Fighters XIII, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Sonic Generations, Spider Man: Shattered Dimensions, The Ship, Warhammer Online and Ys Seven.</p>
<p>Incredible work from all involved to make Linux gaming better than ever.</p>
<p><em>For Steam Deck users: you'll have to wait for SteamOS updates to bring in a new driver for support for all the features. Some of it is not yet ready in the Mesa GPU drivers for either desktop or Steam Deck.</em></p>

      <title>Fantasy strategy game Winter Falling: Battle Tactics now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combining elements and being inspired by the likes of FTL and Total War, Winter Falling: Battle Tactics is a pretty unique strategy game. It released recently into Early Access and it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Something I covered briefly back in 2020, the free prototype can still be played on <a href="https://rarykos.itch.io/winter-falling-price-of-life" target="_blank">itch.io</a> so you can get a feel for it but the new Steam release is much expanded and the developer said they plan to keep it in Early Access until at least 2024. It's a bit of an odd strategy game to describe that's a bit like an icon-view of Total War battles but with resource management too. A small and tightly designed strategy game that's worth a look if you love smaller experiences that somehow still feel grand overall.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gUKR08lhcf8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/626c106ff427cc6e1b2f92f67f6a9407.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gUKR08lhcf8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>COMMAND your army in battles:</strong> Battles play out in real time, but you can play at your own speed, just pause and ponder.</li>
<li><strong>Plan your STRATEGY outside battles:</strong> Manage your army on the world map. Will your troops be well-fed? Will you loot cities to fill your chest?</li>
<li><strong>Craft YOUR BATTLES:</strong> Use the <u>in-game map editor</u> to create your own battles, share them easily with a copy-paste!</li>
<li><strong>MODDING Support:</strong> Create your own units, your own weapons, your own races!</li>
<li><strong>Inspired by the CLASSICS:</strong> Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat, FTL, Total War.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors might dethrone the likes of Vampire Survivors for me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors is a new Early Access game that arrived with Native Linux support on November 7th, it's also now already one of my favourite games. It works great out of the box too and it appears to be getting quite popular, with a Very Positive user rating and over 14,000 people playing it right now.</p>
<p>Styled like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and many other action horde-style games, you run around using various abilities taking down tons of enemies with completely over the top action. Here there are hundreds of skills, a lot of characters, a lot you can upgrade and they have plans to add in a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_CCubu42vF0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bd364dca0eb2987bea5f47355831f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_CCubu42vF0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It works great on desktop Linux too! On Fedora Linux, even on max settings it never dropped below 60FPS while I had a video rendering in the background. Seems like they did a good job on the Native Linux build! Really impressed with the quality as well as the gameplay action.</p>
<p>While Vampire Survivors is fun, there’s no doubt in my mind about that and my many hours in it were great, this just has a much better gameplay feel to it and honestly, I prefer the graphical style here too a lot more. The game design just feels more coherent as a whole, although it’s not without flaws. Visibility is an issue, especially on the initial sandy level but no doubt they will work on it. The ridiculous amount of content on top of the satisfying loop will have me coming back often.</p>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore almost 150 unique Active Skills (and growing!).</li>
<li>Unlock and play with 14 Characters, with many more to come.</li>
<li>Experiment with hundreds of Passive Skills and Runes to customize your characters.</li>
<li>Progress through the Skill Tree with your Soulstones.</li>
<li>Face and defeat powerful Bosses.</li>
<li>Choose Curses that increase your challenge in interesting ways.</li>
<li>Overcome extreme challenges to craft legendary weapons.</li>
<li>Complete dozens of achievements and unlock new powers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 had a major upgrade, and Native Linux support is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this was unexpected. Rogue Legacy 2 from Cellar Door Games just had a massive upgrade and they've announced Native Linux and macOS versions are on the way.</p>
<p>Inside the rather long <a href="https://roguelegacy2.com/patchnotes/v110" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even More for the Masses – Now that RL2 has been released on the Nintendo Switch, we're working on native versions for Mac and Linux that we hope to have ready soon. And as a sweet cherry on top, the game has been fully translated in Japanese!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seems game porter and FNA developer Ethan Lee had a hand in this, as mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1590422739873304576" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p>
<p>This fresh update also overhauled the game engine behind the scenes that they said better performance was a goal, with no part of the game left untouched but the experience should remain the same (apart from being smoother overall).</p>
<p>If you've not played it the game is a "genealogical rogue-LITE", that has all the usual bits like randomized runs, changing characters and so on with persistent upgrades but it's all about family. Each time you die your heir rises to take their place and carry on your run, and each is different.</p>

      <title>FSR 2.1 is a game-changer for Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 from CD PROJEKT RED recently had a big <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/46420/patch-1-61-list-of-changes" target="_blank">1.61 patch</a> out, and with it came support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.1.</p>
<p>Previously CP2077 only had FSR 1.0 and the amount of improvements between 1.0 and 2.1 for FSR is crazy. The picture quality is massively improved, as shown with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2 video</a>, and for Cyberpunk 2077 the difference is quite striking. Picture quality pretty close to native resolution, with a vastly improved FPS and frame-timing. It's like a complete night and day difference.</p>
<p>Have a look at the comparison below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wvuDVGMPQNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0f6152dd1ebf46b81bae8f7d13ad55b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm <em>amazed</em> by it. Until now, I was really struggling to get enough enjoyment out of Cyberpunk 2077 because it's such an intensive game on your system. On my Fedora Linux desktop, it's simply unplayable, as the controls don't work properly and my character keeps staring at the floor or ceiling and I've never figured out why. On Steam Deck though, it controls well and now thanks to this — looks and performs much better too. </p>
<p>Hopefully more developers will go back to add in FSR 2.1 to their games, it's awesome.</p>
<p>You can buy it for Linux / Steam Deck directly on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with text sizing in CP2077 on Steam Deck (and fixing some being distorted with FSR 2.1), here's a mod you can try:</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Halo Infinite working again on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having issues with the latest major update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> on Steam Deck or Linux desktop? Valve has already released a Proton Hotfix update to sort it.</p>
<p>The fix is available in "Proton Hotfix" which is a completely <em>separate</em> version of Proton compared with the default Proton 7 and even Proton Experimental. So if you have it set to Proton Experimental currently, which is where Valve initially got it working, you need to <em>unset</em> it (remove the tick in the compatibility menu) and so it will pick up the Proton Hotfix on Steam Deck. For <em>desktop</em> Linux, you will need to force it to Proton Hotfix manually. If you have any trouble, search for Proton Hotfix in your Steam Library to make sure it is installed and updated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8ihZSkw_fOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a59b5e53360f4c9ee89d4389a203361.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8ihZSkw_fOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I tested Proton Hotfix on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop — works for both. Great job Valve and CodeWeavers on the compatibility fix there so quickly.</p>
<p>Some of the big stuff that's new in Halo Infinite includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Network Co-Op Campaign</li>
<li>Campaign Mission Replay</li>
<li>New Campaign Achievements</li>
<li>Forge Mode (Beta)</li>
<li>Progression Improvements</li>
<li>Winter Update Battle Pass</li>
<li>Upcoming Events</li>
<li>New Multiplayer Mode: Covert One-Flag</li>
<li>New Multiplayer Maps</li>
<li>Matchmaking Improvements</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Client Beta adds a new launch option for Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are working fast to clean up this New Big Picture Mode taken from the Steam Deck, with another Steam Client Beta for desktops <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948454656201" target="_blank">out now</a>.</p>
<p>There's now two different launch arguments you can use, depending on how you play with Steam. There's the original "-gamepadui" to launch directly into the newer Big Picture Mode but there's also now "-newbigpicture", which will start in desktop mode but allow you to launch into the new Big Picture Mode (so the button doesn't launch into the old one).</p>
<p>The full changes below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed inaccurate regions where clicking would allow dragging the Friends List</li>
<li>Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added command-line argument -newbigpicture which will cause the Steam Client to use the New Big Picture Mode, while starting in Desktop mode. This is separate from -gamepadui, which will cause the Steam Client to start in the New Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues where UI would show in the main window instead of the Overlay</li>
<li>Added work-around for crash caused by older NVIDIA drivers that prevented showing additional information in the Settings =&gt; System panel</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>The Xbox extended features driver has been updated for Windows 11</li>
<li>Fixed hang when the Amazon Luna controller rumbles on macOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo controllers while streaming</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a few extra fixes in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3425577645381338803" target="_blank">Beta</a> update last night, which pulls in a few useful sounding fixes for the Steam Deck. This is available in Beta and Preview. To change over you can find it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added error dialog for when the user clicks on a mailto link</li>
<li>Set scale for startup movies so that the top and bottom of the movie are cropped for 16:9 aspect ratio in docked mode</li>
<li>Fixed issue in desktop mode that sometimes made it difficult to drag the Friends List</li>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo Switch controllers while streaming</li>
<li>Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List in desktop mode</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent exiting offline mode in the same session where the client entered offline mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, I did a little video on Battlefield 1 on Steam Deck recently and I was quite impressed overall by how it runs and it's pretty fun:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA PhysX 5.1 SDK goes open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now under a BSD license, today NVIDIA put up the NVIDIA PhysX 5.1 SDK as open source which is great to see from team green.</p>
<p>Something they now use in NVIDIA Omniverse, their real-time graphics collaboration platform, it wasn't entirely clear if they would open it up like previous versions but now they have. Great for game devs and anyone else who wants to see what they're doing with it.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/open-source-simulation-expands-with-nvidia-physx-5-release/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<p>“Having a powerful, open-source tool for physics like NVIDIA’s new PhysX 5 library is a critical part of the realism delivered by the Open 3D Engine,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director at the Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Digital Media and Games at the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>“As PhysX use cases spread to other important 3D domains like simulation and digital twins, we are excited to see NVIDIA working with open source, allowing everyone to harness the innovation and collaboration that these communities can bring,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>What is PhysX exactly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PhysX is a library for representing three dimensional worlds made of discrete entities named actors which can in turn be composed of multiple shapes. PhysX lets the user create and destroy such actors, and tracks their explicit or proximity based interactions. Actors can either be static, be moved around by the user, or be moved by PhysX according to the laws of classical mechanics. PhysX’ dynamics simulation capability includes support for collision, joints and actuation using maximal and/or reduced coordinates. Furthermore, the world may be queried by the user using a number of different tools ranging from simple ray-casts to sweep and overlap tests. PhysX provides extensions for special purpose functionality such as vehicle simulation.</p>
<p>PhysX is designed to be robust, high performance, scalable, portable, as well as easy to integrate and use. These capabilities make PhysX suitable as a foundation technology for game engines and other real time simulation systems.</p>
<cite>NVIDIA Documentation</cite></blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA said in the announcement their plan is to also bundle Flow (combustible fluid, fire and smoke simulation) and Blast (a destruction library) which don't depend on PhysX, but they've decided to include that too under the same open source license.</p>
<p>Seems like NVIDIA plan to up open more of Omniverse too as time goes on.</p>
<p>Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Nebula is a starship colony sim with RPG adventures styled like RimWorld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/inspired-by-factorio-and-rimworld-space-colony-building-sim-stardeus-out-in-early-access/" target="_blank">Stardeus</a> is not the only RimWorld inspired space colony sim around, with Nebula being another that plans to release in 2023. It recently finished crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chaossystematic/nebula-2/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with $87,290 from backers. You can support it still via their <a href="https://chaossystematic.myshopify.com/" target="_blank">SlackerBacker</a>.</p>
<p>In Nebula you build up your starship, and then guide it through space and explore "millions" of star systems and planets that feature "diverse factions and unique environments". So it's basically a blending of RimWorld and Stardeus together. See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BTx19RQMki8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5df9ec48382be1f4e23ab77917d1881a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BTx19RQMki8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly sounds and looks good, although it is very ambitious. With space and planet exploration, along with your colonists each having simulated physical and personality traits there's a lot going on. The quest system sounds like a lot of fun too having you do all sorts of things including retrieving valuable artifacts and defending locals from invasions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the amount of funding they gathered a few extras will be added in like animal taming, a full soundtrack, Z-Levels (underground exploration), moons, vehicles and more. Seems like it's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>In the Kickstarter FAQ, they confirmed their plans for other platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the Early Access phase, we are also planning to bring Nebula to the Mac and Linux platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946440/Nebula/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sonic Frontiers works on Steam Deck and Linux desktop although it has issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Frontiers is a big new release on Steam from SEGA and it does work out of the box on Steam Deck, although it has certain issues.</p>
<p>For starters, I noticed that unless I limited it to 30FPS in the game settings, the lighting would flicker and be unplayable. Searching around, I'm not the only one that saw this although some were lucky and did not. Hopefully either a game update or Proton update will eventually fix it for everyone. Shadows can be problematic as well, keeping that setting on Low solves any issues there too. Valve has marked it as Unsupported for now but it does work.</p>
<p>Using the latest GE-Proton, it also remains mostly smooth with the DXVK_ASYNC setting. Here's a video look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5NiAUGPAYIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f291b292e481cd68109e3dc1129a28b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5NiAUGPAYIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>For an example of the flickering, see <a href="https://youtu.be/qya0jTFZiRs" target="_blank">this unlisted video</a> (there's plenty of worse areas).</em></p>
<p>As for <em>desktop</em> Linux, it seems to be better there with an NVIDIA GPU on max settings. It definitely doesn't stick to 60FPS even with my 2080Ti and a Ryzen 7 5800X with plenty of drops down here and there at 1080p depending on what you're doing, but overall it remains somewhat smooth.</p>
<p>Here, the lighting issue at 60FPS still seems to be present but at times it can be easy to miss. When running around, you can see a brief flick between light and dark that doesn't happen often, whereas on the Deck, the flickering of lighting is <em>constant</em> unless in 30FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6055856081667917497gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6055856081667917497gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Sonic Frontiers on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Seems like overall it needs a fair bit more optimisation, as a game like this performing like it does doesn't seem right. Playable and seems quite fun actually but performance is an issue, as are the graphical issues noted especially so on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sonic-frontiers?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237320/Sonic_Frontiers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a free indie cross-over update, Terraria 1.4.5 will see Dead Cells content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two games are doing an indie crossover, with a Dead Cells update out now and the next Terraria update will also include some Dead Cells content.</p>
<p>For Dead Cells that's updated already, the developer added in quite a bit including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Terraria - 'The Guide' and the heavenly sword Starfury! Striking enemies with this gloriously pink sword causes fragments of stars to fall from the sky, dealing critical hits to other enemies around you. The drawback is that it's a relatively slow and static weapon, but chuck a few dodge rolls in there and you'll be fine.</li>
<li>Shovel Knight - King Scepter! Shovel Knight will be shoulder bashing your enemies to launch himself into the air, then spinning around the screen drilling enemies into the ground with critical hits. Bouncing on an enemy let's you charge again, so see how long you can keep the chain going!</li>
<li>Hotline Miami - Jacket and his trusty Baseball Bat are swinging into Dead Cells, with not one, not two, but three different masks. The Baseball bat crits on stunned enemies, so you're basically required to hit enemies while they're down... Look out for the damage number VFX pulled from Hotline Miami too!</li>
<li>Katana ZERO - Throwable Objects stun your enemies, allowing you to close the distance and get some shots in, or give you time to charge the katana's dash attack... You've only got 3 charges of throwable stuff, so you'll need to kill enemies to refill your stash.</li>
<li>Slay the Spire - The Diverse Deck translates each of the 4 classes from Slay the Spire into one complex skill. You will initially gain a passive power from one class. You can play with this passive for as long as you like, then activating it provides a one-off boost effect, and the skill moves on to the next class.</li>
<li>Risk of Rain - The Laser Glaive is irresistibly drawn to enemy after enemy, rebounding around the screen dealing damage to as many foes as possible. It gains damage after each extra enemy it hits and will start dealing crits after hitting multiple enemies. Not bad for crowd control...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Re-Logic have <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-is-coming-in-2023-including-terraria-x-dead-cells.116264/" target="_blank">announced</a> Terraria 1.4.5 will be coming next year, and with it some Dead Cells content. They're not saying exactly what though. Sounds like work on it hasn't begun yet so more details to come next year on that.</p>

      <title>Steam gets a whole lot of improvements for the new Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still not quite ready yet it seems but Valve are pushing out lots of changes for the new Big Picture Mode, taken from the Steam Deck. Released in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948450355513" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a>, there's quite a lot of improvements and fixes this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/235584031667913529gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/235584031667913529gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some scaling issues that led to UI being offset slightly in various places</li>
<li>Center the Big Picture Mode window when not running in fullscreen mode (i.e. when -windowed is passed as a command-line argument)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where navigating to the Steam Store would sit at the loading screen (e.g. after exiting BPM to return to the desktop UI, and then back to BPM)</li>
<li>Fixed some issues where the UI would not navigate properly within the Overlay</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the controller configurator would not be displayed within the Overlay for some games that Steam calls to open it</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the incorrect Patch Notes were displayed</li>
<li>Fixed issue with the Virtual Keyboard also showing in the main window when it was invoked within the Overlay</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the footer would update in the main window when the user was navigating the UI in the Overlay</li>
<li>Removed Steam Deck specific dialog warning the user about running multiple games</li>
<li>When installing a game always show the install location picker if there is more than one library folder, and automatically focus the default library folder when the dialog shows up</li>
<li>Add a toggle to Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced to force GPU accelerated rendering for GPUs that are in the embedded browser's blocklist</li>
<li>Fixed automatically switching audio devices on launch on Linux</li>
<li>Fixed the old version of Big Picture Mode opening when hitting the Steam/Guide button on the Steam window</li>
<li>Fixed issues where the main window would close and then be reloaded:
<ul>
<li>When selecting a friend in the previously or recently played</li>
<li>When selecting a guide in a game's Community Feed</li>
<li>When selecting the "Downloading" label on a game's detail page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Center the popup controller configurator window when viewing controller layout</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam would be unable to connect in some cases after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed recently played games not showing up in the MRU list on the notification area icon or the Recent Games shelf in library</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bug where opening the Steam menu (at least on Fedora KDE Plasma + NVIDIA) shows what's behind the Big Picture Mode window is still present, annoyingly. Hopefully Valve will solve that one soon as well. Trying to open the Quick Access Menu (Xbox button + A for example) sometimes brings up the main Steam menu first too, it's a little too quick to react at times. Still, even in the rough state it's still in right now, it's going to be a lot better than the original Big Picture Mode.</p>

      <title>Surprising probably no one, most people use the Steam Deck as a handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, I ran two different polls to find out how people with a Steam Deck used their device (or if they didn't much) and the results are out now.</p>
<p>The key thing about the Steam Deck, is that while it is a handheld it's also a full Linux PC with a desktop mode. Many docks are available for it from different brands now and even the official Docking Station from Valve is out and has been for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">about a month</a> now.</p>
<p>So I was keen to find out how what percentage of people actually used it mainly docked, partly also because I use now the vast majority of my time with it docked. Turns out, not a whole lot of other people do.</p>
<p>From over 4,000 votes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our YouTube Channel</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5824387571667836197gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5824387571667836197gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our Twitter</a> from over 1,000 votes paints a very similar picture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3946000081667836359gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3946000081667836359gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What a shock, over 70% of people using a handheld use it as a handheld. I know, it's not breaking news but I found it interesting, because of how much I use it docked myself and how I've seen a lot of comments of others doing the same. Turns out though, it's a really small amount of people overall.</p>
<p>I suppose it didn't help that the docked experience wasn't great at release, and it still has plenty of issues now, like I noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">my article on the official Docking Station</a> not always displaying on my TV.</p>
<p>Another bit I wanted to highlight, was a really interesting comment on the GOL YouTube Channel about this from user "MechanicalMonk", which I <em>can't</em> link to as the original poll was <em>removed</em> to add an extra missed option. Anyway, they mentioned that people buying the Switch would have done so <em>anyway</em> because it's Nintendo and many people use it exclusively docked as it just happens to be a handheld (although, there is the newer handheld-only Lite). On the other hand, people would have been far less likely to buy the Steam Deck if it wasn't a handheld and so it favours that. Just an interesting thought.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? How do you use it?</em></p>

      <title>American Truck Simulator - Texas releases on November 15th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Soft have announced the big American Truck Simulator - Texas DLC will be releasing on November 15th.</p>
<p>A DLC no doubt many have been waiting for to take in the sights. One exciting element to it that SCS detailed in a previous <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/10/texas-space-industry.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, is that the Space Industry will be nicely featured in this DLC. They mentioned how "Texas is home to state-of-the-art development and test sites for multiple commercial space firms, and research shows that the space industry is big work for the state, bringing in 11 billion dollars per year in revenue and providing hundred of thousands of jobs. So it wouldn't be right for us to miss this out-of-this-world opportunity to include it in our upcoming Texas DLC for American Truck Simulator".</p>
<p>Thanks to their work you'll be able to see some pretty fun spacey things as you travel around, including a certain famous space centre that they said is really worth passing by in your trucks. </p>
<p>See their 3 minute trailer below:</p>

      <title>AMD becomes a &#39;Diamond&#39; sponsor of OBS Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> announced that AMD have become a Diamond Sponsor of the OBS Project, helping fund future development. Great to see, as OBS Studio is easily one of the most popular free and open source applications around and something I use near-daily.</p>
<p>It was announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1588301361275441154" target="_blank">Twitter</a> with a short message just confirming it, with no other details.</p>
<p>What it means is that AMD are now funding OBS with at least $50,000 per year, joining NVIDIA and StreamElements at the same level. OBS also has many additional sponsors including YouTube, Logitech, Twitch, Facebook and others giving over plenty of funding and other help to the project.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This really is amazing to see. The last few years have seen so many positive stories like this for free and open source projects. Blender is another that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/volkswagen-begins-funding-blender-development/" target="_blank">keeps pulling in</a> more funding, Godot Engine just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/godot-engine-now-has-its-own-dedicated-foundation-for-funding/" target="_blank">launched their own Foundation</a> and even the Kdenlive video editor funding campaign I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/kde-are-raising-funds-for-the-kdenlive-video-editor/" target="_blank">mentioned previously</a> has reached over the original goal.</p>
<p><em>Good times for FOSS projects.</em></p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The point and click adventures just keep coming! Plot of the Druid has released featuring some more sarcastic British humour and classic, hand-drawn art. It's currently in Early Access, with Native Linux support. Another that was funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/plot-of-the-druid/plot-of-the-druid" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the developer receiving $32,303 to help make it real.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-39 released improving Overwatch 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> is the community-maintained version of the Windows compatibility layer Proton, not endorsed by Valve but it can get more games running on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. A new release version GE-Proton7-39 is out now.</p>
<p>Here's the change highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to git</li>
<li>overwatch 2 freeze fix added (may help other games)</li>
<li>pulled in upstream proton nvapi fixes</li>
<li>enabled gamedrive option for ESO by default</li>
<li>mono updated to 7.4.0</li>
<li>no-longer-required protonfixes removed for Sonic Adventures 2, Farcry 5 EAC, Origin (thanks Bitwolfies)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For those curious on how to set up Overwatch 2 on Steam Deck, I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/heres-how-to-play-overwatch-2-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">cover that before using the Bottles app</a> but since GE-Proton has some fixes in this release and the previous GE-Proton release, here's a video guide on how to do Battle Net and Overwatch 2 directly through Steam:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DTJ2dh_mv3Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/551f809ccdbd0011870592d8c007f403.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DTJ2dh_mv3Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover.</li>
<li>Install GE-Proton7-39 from ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Close and reload Steam.</li>
<li>Download the Battle Net launcher.</li>
<li>Add the Battle Net installer into Steam. Add Game (bottom left) -&gt; Non-Steam game, select it from the list in your Downloads folder (select All Files from the bottom of the file picker to see it).</li>
<li>Right click on it in Steam, go to Properties and select Compatibility. Tick the box and select GE-Proton7-39.</li>
<li>Install it and then remove the shortcut.</li>
<li>Add a new shortcut to the installed Battle Net launcher exe file. Again setting the compatibility on it to GE-Proton7-39.</li>
<li>Now you're done. You can load it and install Overwatch 2 or anything else from Battle Net and run it inside Steam directly without another app like Bottles or Lutris.</li>

      <title>Cemu emulator for Wii U now provides an AppImage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get the Wii U emulator <a href="https://cemu.info/" target="_blank">Cemu</a> working on Linux? It's now a little easier, as they've providing an AppImage with the latest release.</p>
<p>Version <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/tag/v2.0-14" target="_blank">Cemu 2.0-14 (Experimental)</a> just went up and this is the first to offer the AppImage, which should work across various Linux distributions and perhaps make it easier on Steam Deck as well. Nice to see they keep improving it little by little, as they slowly move towards the full 2.0 release that's open source.</p>
<p>They're not yet providing a full changelog between the small releases of the 2.0 release, with these still being listed as the main changes since the last major release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cemu is now <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu" target="_blank">open-source!</a></li>
<li>Preliminary Linux builds are available <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases" target="_blank">on github</a>, but be warned that they are still very rough around the edges</li>
<li>Going forward, we simplified the versioning a bit by using shorter version numbers for stable releases (2.1, 2.2, 2.3..). This version (2.0) is an exception in the sense that it follows the pattern of a stable release but is very much experimental.</li>
<li>Updated all dependencies. Most notably SDL (input &amp; motion) and wxWidgets (UI)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the H264 video decoder. Resolves crash on Smash title screen</li>
<li>Made nsysnet a little less crash prone. Fixes crash in Call of Duty: Black Ops II</li>
<li>Fixed a logging related crash that could occur under very specific circumstances. Seen in Wind Waker if letting the game idle on the title screen for 2 minutes</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when the path to Cemu.exe contained unicode characters</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when loading .elf homebrew</li>
<li>The account list in the title manager save exporter is no longer empty</li>
<li>Latency for wiimotes should be a bit better now</li>
<li>Added symbol/function list to debugger + other small debugger/assembler improvements</li>
<li>Implemented API: coreinit.FSOpenFileExAsync (used by some homebrew)</li>
<li>Many more under-the-hood changes and fixes</li>
<li>Some more work towards a Stop&amp;Restart emulation feature. Not ready yet but we are getting there</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dota 2 set to remove OpenGL support, new hero announced and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out an <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3398555399443921912" target="_blank">update</a> for Dota 2 and there's some major changes coming, along with another new hero set to enter the fold.</p>
<p>As part of the 2022 Battle Pass: Part II update Valve announced that NVIDIA Reflex support has been added, and they've said that this is the last major update that will have OpenGL support as everyone will need to be using Vulkan on Linux after that. OpenGL removal was previously announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/dota-2-to-drop-opengl-and-32bit-vulkan-default-on-linux-and-ti-21-tickets-on-september-22/" target="_blank">back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>For right now though Valve has added Diretide, their annual event with a new Candyworks game mode. This update also comes with a second Cavern Crawl map and the release of another round of rewards.</p>
<p>As for the new hero, they're named Muerta and they arrive in early 2023:</p>

<p>What else?</p>
<p>Oh, there's also a little sprinkle of Portal with a Cave Johnson (voiced by J. K. Simmons) announcer pack that had its own fun trailer that even pulled in Valve CEO Gabe Newell. Amusingly, Newell calls himself both "G-Money" and "G-Fat" during it.</p>

      <title>Star Labs new StarFighter sounds like a great Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Labs announced their new <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/starfighter" target="_blank">StarFighter</a> a little while ago, but it seems it only just recently went live on their actual store with the full info on what to expect from it.</p>
<p>However, they don't seem to have quite settled on what screen it will have. Currently, it advertises a 16-inch 2560x1600 QHD 165 Hz IPS matte screen, but writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/starlabsltd/status/1587851541007982602" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it seems they are split between that or a 4K version and so the final build might end up with a 4K 60Hz screen instead.</p>
<p>It features a choice between Intel Core 12th generation and AMD Ryzen 7 processors, up to 64GB RAM, up to 18 hrs battery life, a removable webcam, a wireless killswitch, a backlit keyboard, a full-glass haptic trackpad, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C With Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 for charging and expansion, HDMI, 3 x full-size USB 3.0 port, Micro SD slot, coreboot and EDK II support, a 65 watts over USB-C charger and easy Firmware updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20034595371667563310gol1.png"/></p>
<p>As usual, you'll also be able to configure it with various Linux distributions including Ubuntu, elementaryOS, Linux Mint and more. It's not available for a few months yet with no exact date set it seems.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire is getting an official Board Game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love Slay the Spire and want to take it into the real world? There's a Board Game being made for it.</p>
<p>As a big fan of the game with many hours in it on Linux, I feel like I need it but the price is a little on the steep side at $100 for the set. Popular though, as the crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentiongames/slay-the-spire-the-board-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> managed to get funded in only a few minutes and is currently sat pretty at close to $2 million USD in funding — wow.</p>
<p>It's a pretty intricate and luxury board game though, along with a smaller company producing it so the price does sort-of make sense when you take things into account. It's not Monopoly after all. Sure does look fantastic too! The co-op aspect of it sounds pretty fun too.</p>
<p>You can see an overview from YouTube channel The Brothers Murph below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KIorv0ZqEQg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e2c7abf03fc1c867072364d185ee019.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KIorv0ZqEQg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What do you think? Will you pick it up if you're a fan?</p>

      <title>Warzone 2100 version 4.3 is out now with a new &#39;Super Easy&#39; mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source RTS <a href="https://wz2100.net/" target="_blank">Warzone 2100</a> has a new release out, bringing with it a new difficulty mode if you struggled through the campaign. Quite a success story this one. Originally a fully commercial game developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive that was eventually set free. I wish more developers did this eventually.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1182895431667560040gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1182895431667560040gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main improvements in version 4.3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New “Super Easy” difficulty for campaign.</li>
<li>Additional new “Aftermath” soundtrack (from Lupus-Mechanicus).</li>
<li>Add “LOD Distance” Graphics option, to adjust texture sharpness at distance (defaults to “High”).</li>
<li>Add new Video Options (“Minimize on Focus Loss”, “Alt+Enter Toggle”).</li>
<li>Add Flatpak builds (for Linux).</li>
<li>Support for bidirectional text using fribidi.</li>
<li>Improve Cobra AI yet again (balances against defensive / system research when 1v1 on high oil maps).</li>
<li>Show the rank a unit will have if it were produced next.</li>
<li>Add console message when limits change.</li>
<li>Update campaign balance (and fixes) for: Alpha 2, Alpha 6, later Beta missions, Beta-end, Gamma 2.</li>
<li>+ Lots of bug fixes and multiplayer balancing changes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD announce RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT, plus FSR3 teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today at the AMD "together we advance_gaming" event, AMD revealed their new RDNA3 architecture along with the RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT GPUs. Both of these new cards will be available on December 13th, and AMD threw plenty of shade at NVIDIA of the power use and connector issues during the event talking about how "easy" it is to upgrade to it and noting the power use. </p>

<p>They also teased FSR3, which will be due out next year but didn't go into much detail on it. According to AMD FSR3 is "expected to deliver up to 2X more FPS compared to AMD FSR 2 in select games".</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD RDNA 3 Architecture</strong> – Featuring an advanced chiplet design, new compute units and second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, AMD RDNA 3 architecture delivers up to 54% more performance per watt than the previous-generation AMD RDNA 2 architecture. New compute units share resources between rendering, AI and raytracing to make the most effective use of each transistor for faster, more efficient performance than the previous generation.</li>
<li><strong>Chiplet Design</strong> – The world’s first gaming GPU with a chiplet design delivers up to 15% higher frequencies at up to 54% better power efficiency. It includes the new 5nm 306mm Graphics Compute Die (GCD) with up to 96 compute units that provide the core GPU functionality. It also includes six of the new 6nm Memory Cache Die (MCD) at 37.5mm, each with up to 16MB of second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology.</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-Fast Chiplet Interconnect </strong>– Unleashing the benefits of second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, the new chiplets leverage AMD Infinity Links and high-performance fanout packaging to deliver up to 5.3TB/s of bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Memory and Wider Memory Bus </strong>– To meet the growing requirements of today’s demanding titles, the new graphics cards feature up to 24GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory running at 20Gbps over a 384-bit memory bus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the pricing, they seem like pretty great value to me. Having a flagship under $1K is a very good move when compared to what NVIDIA are offering. If the performance is in any way comparable, it should sell quite well.</p>
<p>From the press release: “These new graphics cards are designed by gamers for gamers. As we were developing the new cards, we not only incorporated feedback from our customers, but we built in the features and capabilities we wanted to use,” said Scott Herkelman, senior vice president &amp; general manager, Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “We also realized that we needed to do something different to continue pushing the envelope of the technology, and I’m proud of what the team has accomplished with AMD RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7900 Series graphics cards. I can’t wait for gamers to experience the powerhouse performance, incredibly vivid visuals and amazing new features these new graphics cards offer.”</p>
<p>Full event can be seen below:</p>

<p>Also, it's still fun to see the Steam Deck picture on such events. AMD made the APU so it's only natural for them to highlight it but nice to see it again like this for a device that's helping to do so much for Linux gaming as a whole.</p>

      <title>Play one of the greatest co-op shooters free this weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up on Steam right now is a free weekend for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, easily one of the best co-op shooters around. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and it is Steam Deck "Playable" too. Also 67% off until November 17th.</p>
<p>I've got a ton of hours in this game and honestly, it's incredible. Even though it's tailored for online co-op play, doing it solo is still pretty fun too thanks to the upgradable helper drone you're given. The developer just launched Season 3 "Plaguefall" too adding in a new event, spikes that spread across the map, new tools to deal with the infection spreading, new types of grenades, new cave types to explore, and much more so it's a great time to jump in:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SfNWg_xbRfE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e4f6c9b335aaacf4324025f29041c38.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SfNWg_xbRfE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've shown it off across various livestreams and it's one of my most played games, if you've not tried it yet you've got nothing to lose since you can play free until the very end of the weekend on Steam. A GOL Livestream showed off more of it only recently and you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu_BXaiI92M" target="_blank">VOD here</a>. You can also see a full mission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeeVEvcSjAE" target="_blank">play-through on Steam Deck here</a>.</p>
<p>Safe to say I'm going to be putting a lot more time into it with this update it looks awesome.</p>
<p>This is by far one of the best co-op shooters ever made, and I'm not exaggerating that. I've obviously played a great many shooters over the years and I will still happily keep coming back for more in this.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players specifically, I recommend putting it to Medium settings on all the presets and lock the FPS to 40 and you will get a pretty good time there. Desktop Linux obviously depends on your GPU and CPU but it's not a particularly hard game on resources so lower spec machines can perform nicely.</p>

      <title>Steam on Chromebook is now in Beta with AMD support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is exciting! Even more people will be able to play games on Linux from today, as Google announced Steam on Chromebook is now in Beta. For those less technically-minded reading, Chromebooks run ChromeOS, which is Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/" target="_blank">Back in March</a> it was in Alpha, and it was pretty severely limited in what systems it supported and what it could play but that changes today. In the <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/steam-on-chromeos-beta" target="_blank">announcement</a>, it's mentioned that this stage brings with it "broader availability, an improved user experience, and better performance and compatibility for more of your favorite games".</p>
<p>Part of bringing it to more people is that it moves from ChromeOS Dev to ChromeOS Beta, meaning while Chromebook users still need to switch over to it they're likely to see far less system issues overall while testing. On top of that, Google are now supporting AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series and Intel 12th Gen Core CPUs and lowering the minimum CPU requirement to i3 / Ryzen 3.</p>
<p>Another big improvement is how they handle storage. Some games need to download additional data outside of Steam, so they entirely reworked that and this gave an additional benefit like improved filesystem access performance for Windows games in the Proton compatibility layer. Power management was also upgraded, adding in power notifications on top of full-screen games.</p>
<p>Tons of other improvements like DirectX 12 and Vulkan 1.3 support, improving shader storage and so on. The list of games they've tested and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/#game-list" target="_blank">recommend</a> has grown but still on the small side.</p>
<p>Full changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added various game-specific tweaks</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5000 C-series support</li>
<li>Avoid sleeping when game indicates activity via dbus</li>
<li>Changed shader cache format to reduce disk footprint</li>
<li>Initial DX12 support</li>
<li>Enable pointer lock by default (without the #exo-pointer-lock flag)</li>
<li>Fixed some cases previously resulting in GPU hangs</li>
<li>i3/R3 device support</li>
<li>Improved battery life from reduced CPU overhead in Vulkan and DirectX titles</li>
<li>Optimized display pipeline when scaling</li>
<li>Improved GPU rendering performance with transparent huge page support</li>
<li>Improved handling switching between apps and full-screen</li>
<li>Improved keyboard handling; for example, the launcher key now works when the Steam client is focused</li>
<li>Improved window management support</li>
<li>Include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai fonts</li>
<li>Increased size of shader caches</li>
<li>Intel 12th Gen core support</li>
<li>Low battery notifications</li>
<li>Mouse cursor fixes</li>
<li>New installer and splash screen</li>
<li>Revamped storage management
<ul>
<li>Fixes games that install additional content outside of Steam</li>
<li>Improves file access performance for Proton games</li>
<li>Note: alpha users will need to uninstall and reinstall Steam so these changes can take effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Device no longer sleeps while games are downloading in the background.</li>
<li>Shader caches persist until software update</li>
<li>Show all low-battery notifications while gaming in fullscreen</li>
<li>Vulkan 1.3 support</li>
<li>Vulkan and GL performance improvements</li>
<li>xshape support for games/launchers with transparency</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve has improved the new Big Picture Mode for Desktop quite a bit in a new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> for Desktop has been released, and Valve continue fixing up more issues with the new Big Picture Mode to have it make sense on Desktop. Some of the issues are because it was clearly taken directly from Steam Deck, but now they're getting some proper desktop tweaks in there too.</p>
<p>Reminder: to show the new UI, you need to launch Steam with "-gamepadui" as a launch option as shown <a href="https://youtu.be/ztW9LP8bmvg" target="_blank">in my previous video</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3487041261667492156gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3487041261667492156gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where uninstall dialogs were showing up twice (this may still happen after bringing up the controller configurator or standalone keyboard).</li>
<li>Fixed issue [where] exiting a game would bring up the new Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed virtual keyboard being scaled incorrectly inside its window</li>
<li>More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to Exit Big Picture Mode and go back to the regular Steam desktop client. In this situation, clicking the Enter Big Picture Mode button will enter the new Big Picture (only happens if you use -gamepadui)</li>
<li>Fixed some instances [where] focus was lost</li>
<li>Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images</li>
<li>Force GPU acceleration for the UI</li>
<li>Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They still haven't fixed it showing what's behind Big Picture Mode on a KDE Plasma Desktop with NVIDIA though. A bug I find thoroughly odd, since the overlay from the Quick Access Menu works just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4890583661667492155gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4890583661667492155gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Update —</strong> an additional Steam Client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948436064009" target="_blank">update</a> went out today (November 3rd) with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed overlay not working properly in non-Steam games</li>
<li>Fixed scaling issue in the desktop UI when exiting Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed issues with some dialogs not showing in the Steam Overlay</li>
<li>Removed some options in the Quick Access menu that are not currently supported outside of Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the Friends List was not accessible after exiting Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>The controller overlay now respects the "Use Nintendo Button Layout" setting in the New Big Picture</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve fix new EA app in Proton Experimental for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, EA starting removing Origin from games on Steam and replacing it with the EA app <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/ea-begins-swapping-out-origin-for-ea-app-on-steam/" target="_blank">which as I noted before</a>, caused numerous issues. Now, Valve should have solved it in Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Some games just didn't work at all with the change, others needed a re-install, some needed a couple of re-loads and so on. It was a big nuisance and quite annoying that EA seemingly didn't work with Valve on it before pushing out such a big change. Anyway, should be all good now.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Edge Webview installer throwing an error when starting Vermintide 2 for the first time.</li>
<li>Fix the new EA launcher displaying a blank window.</li>
<li>Fix The Anacrusis not displaying video when joining a match (experimental regression).</li>
<li>Enable nvapi for: Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Online.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder (for desktop), you now need Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer for Proton Experimental. On Steam Deck, Valve control the drivers for you so it's fine.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video that goes over the changes and shows you what to do on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lg_Bt7TdEqE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3dbf53b0b37e90a1b00070d58feff26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lg_Bt7TdEqE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Access your Amazon Prime Gaming library on Linux with the Nile Project</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon's<a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank"> Prime Gaming</a> service has been dishing out free-to-keep games to its subscribers for some time now, but accessing these games required running the Amazon Gaming client through Wine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/nile" target="_blank">Nile Project</a> provides a native interface for your Prime Gaming library by interacting with the Amazon API to download and play your games from the command line. A nice advantage to using Nile is that you can change your Wine environment on a per-game basis, rather than installing a copy of Amazon Games for each. I spoke with project developer <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin" target="_blank">Linguin</a>, who also works on <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a>, and he plans to incorporate Nile into Heroic in the near future, so if you aren't keen to use the command line you can consider this a quick sneak peek. The developer also mentioned it's not ready for Steam Deck yet and while possible it's not recommended, so this is for desktop Linux for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20004241041667433213gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20004241041667433213gol1142.png"/></a><small>SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech running through Nile</small></p>
<p>The project is still in early days, and as such the documentation is a bit sparse. Let's take a look at using Nile to access some of those Bezos freebies. Most of this information can be found in the project's README.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Get Nile and dependencies</h4>
<p>Nile is not (yet) packaged for distributions, so grab it from the GitHub repository using git:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">git clone https://github.com/imLinguin/nile</code></p>
<p>You will also need the project dependencies, which you can install system-wide for Arch Linux like so:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">pacman -Syu pyqt5 python-pycryptodome python-zstandard python-requests python-protobuf</code></p>
<p>or or for Ubuntu like so:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pycryptodome python3-requests python3-zstd</code></p>
<p>If you are on a different distribution you could instead install the required python packages system-wide with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/" target="_blank">pip</a>, although personally I wouldn't recommend it. A better option is to make a virtual environment, then activate the environment before running Nile. To do this, run: <code>python3 -m venv env &amp;&amp; source ./env/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements.txt</code>Note that the virtual environment will only be active for the terminal you ran <code class="inline-code">source ./env/bin/activate</code> on, so you will need to re-run it for new terminals before running Nile.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Download your Games</h4>
<p>In the Nile directory you downloaded from GitHub, run <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile auth --login</code>, which will pop open a window with the Amazon login. Once you have logged in, you can list your games with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile library list</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3991698761667433471gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3991698761667433471gol1142.png"/></a><small>Nile listing my Prime Gaming library</small></p>
<p>Choose the game you would like to install and copy the associated ID string, then run <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile install </code>, replacing with the string you copied. The download will start - there is no indication of download progress so you'll just have to be patient. You can verify that the game has been installed with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile library list</code>.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Play</h4>
<p>Once completed, you can launch the game using the default system Wine prefix with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile launch </code>. A nice feature is that you can instead use one of your pre-existing Wine bottles from <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to run one of your Amazon games with GE Proton you could create a bottle using the Bottles GUI  or from the command line<br/>
<code>bottles-cli new --bottle-name ge_proton --environment gaming --runner GE-Proton7-38</code><br/>
Then use that bottle to play your game<br/>
<code>./bin/nile launch --bottle ge_proton</code></p>
<p>While it's still early days for this project, I think it's great how easy it's getting to access games on platforms besides Steam, and the Nile project moves us that little bit farther into the glorious Linux gaming future.</p>

      <title>JSAUX teasing a clear Back Plate for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX, maker of many Steam Deck Docking Stations, might be teasing a clear Back Plate they're designing for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They seem to be never far away from releasing something new, with on Docking Station after another but now it seems they're onto something different. I'm surprised it actually took any company this long, as no doubt a clear Back Plate would be popular as we all know clear tech is awesome. I fondly remember my see-through Game Boy Pocket, what a glorious thing it was.</p>
<p>Anyway, on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1587097997828988928" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, JSAUX teased "We are designing a new product, related to the shell on the back, let me see if anyone guesses correctly what it is.👀" with this image:</p>

      <title>Microsoft upgraded Xbox Cloud Gaming for Linux and ChromeOS (so Steam Deck too!)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On the community Reddit for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/play" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, an Xbox employee put up a small announcement about an upgraded experience for Linux and ChromeOS game streaming.</p>
<p>Something we've been waiting on for some time, as without workarounds you were limited to a low resolution. You could make it better by spoofing Edge on Windows for example. Even with that, I noticed it didn't perform as well as expected. Now, that should no longer be the case.</p>
<p>Xbox Cloud developer Jordan Cohen said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/ykb1v1/performance_and_quality_improvements_on_linux_and/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! We've just released a set of performance improvements on Xbox Cloud Gaming for gamers playing via browser on Linux and ChromeOS devices. You can expect a higher resolution and smoother streaming experience. </p>
<p>These changes also complete a long journey of upgrading our browser gaming experience to a different streaming technology. You should now have a more consistent experience in the browser, no matter what device you use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it myself today on both desktop Linux and Steam Deck, and it does seem to work just fine.</p>
<p>Despite what Microsoft like to say, you <em>don't</em> need Edge and it works just fine in Chrome. Nothing extra is needed on desktop Linux, it's click and play. But for Steam Deck, you can set it up like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure Chrome is installed (available via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library), or via Discover in Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>In Desktop Mode enter this command into the Konsole terminal app: <code>flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code><br/>
<em>This enables the Gamepads to work.</em></li>
<li>Load Chrome and go to Xbox.com/Play, and setup your login. It's easier in desktop mode.</li>
<li>If you wish to auto-launch Xbox Cloud Gaming with Chrome with no address bar, add this to the very end of the launch options (Properties menu on Chrome in your Steam Library): <code>--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://xbox.com/play"</code></li>
<li>In Gaming Mode on Steam Deck, tap Chrome in your Steam Library and set Steam Input (the Gamepad icon on the right) into Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad. Also set the Right Trackpad as Mouse Click, as it helps you deal with any browser pop-ups.</li>
<li>Launch Chrome, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>As a side-note, if you really do need or want to use Edge instead of Chrome, you can just change the end of point 2 to have this at the end com.microsoft.Edge instead of com.google.Chrome.</em></p>
<p>Here's a video reminder on how to do it along with some quick footage:</p>

      <title>Loading bigger libraries should be faster in the new Steam Deck Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Available in the Beta and Preview channels, Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3425577645359615159" target="_blank">released</a> a new Steam Deck Client Update with a few useful little fixes. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some instances were focus was lost</li>
<li>More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries</li>
<li>Fixed issue where spotlighted games in the Whats New section could not be interacted with</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with trackpad typing</li>
<li>Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images</li>
<li>Fixed Main Menu not adjusting size/position when adjusting UI scale</li>
<li>Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser</li>
<li>Fixed issue with sign in refresh UI when the user had already signed in once during the current session</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do find the initial login is still a little sluggish myself, with over 2,000 games it gets me into the Home screen fine but it's not very responsive still for a few more seconds. Hopefully they will keep at it.</p>
<p>Hopefully we shall soon hear more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steamos-34-beta-to-update-the-arch-linux-base-new-steam-deck-updates-out-now/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4</a>, as I'm exciting for all the software updates that will come along with it like a much improved version of KDE Plasma for desktop mode. What are you looking forward to?</p>
<p><strong>Update —</strong> an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3425577645362930709" target="_blank">additional</a> Deck Client Beta went out today (November 3rd), here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Fixed issue in Desktop mode where the Steam Library was not loading properly.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.</li>
<li>Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fun Steam Deck Verified &amp; Playable games from October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the Steam Deck hit over 6,000 games marked as Playable and Verified together, so I took a little look at some of the entries across October to point out some fun picks.</p>
<p>Featuring games both new and old, games going through Deck Verified can be a fun reminder of what existing games are out there to go through your back catalogue. You can see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=DeckCompatDate_DESC&amp;deck_compatibility=3%2C2&amp;os=win%2Clinux" target="_blank">Valve's list here</a>, although they really need to upgrade it as sorting by the verification date ends up showing games that had a small tweak to their listing without a change to the verified status so it can confuse people.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vKs_kTg4B1Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47f8b7c583be6a57e6ac6a42b30f3521.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vKs_kTg4B1Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My quick picks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337920/Serial_Cleaners/" target="_blank">Serial Cleaners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684930/CULTIC/" target="_blank">CULTIC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/" target="_blank">Unrailed!</a> (Native Linux)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank">Anger Foot Demo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/637090/BATTLETECH/" target="_blank">BATTLETECH</a> (Playable - Native Linux but Steam Deck uses Proton)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1647550/NEO_The_World_Ends_with_You/" target="_blank">NEO: The World Ends with You</a> (Playable)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2087030/Shatterline/" target="_blank">Shatterline</a> (Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them should work on desktop Linux too thanks to Proton or Native Linux builds.</p>

      <title>PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe is Steam Deck Verified before release with a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe is the next Steam release coming from Q-Games and they've managed to get it Steam Deck Verified ahead of release. Originally released on Apple Arcade, it's getting a full Steam release at some point but there's no exact date on that yet.</p>
<p>Valve seem to be rating more demos recently, as they also did the same for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank">Anger Foot</a> but in that case only the demo is verified. Here it seems the entire game and demo has verification.</p>
<p>"In PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, clean up the streets of Junktown and trash anyone who gets in your way!</p>
<p>Take on the role of the Scrappers, a squad of robot garbage collectors working to clean up a grimy city in the not-so-distant future. Sweep the streets alone or form the ultimate team with up to 4 players. Time is money in Junktown, so stack that trash high and toss to your squad to boost efficiency for bigger rewards."</p>

      <title>Narrative adventure Where Birds Go to Sleep has a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love text-based narrative adventures that look a bit insane? Where Birds Go to Sleep is releasing next year and they now have a demo available. The game will also have Native Linux support, and the demo already does.</p>
<p>"Slip into the subconscious of Cormo, a primitive criminal sent on a mission to chart new, mystical lands shrouded in a mind-altering fog. You never directly assume control, but you will mould him through every decision and every sentence you put in his mind. Uncover the dark mysteries of the island and of the human psyche. Become what you hate in Where Birds Go To Sleep."</p>
<p>The developer mentions it touches on sensitive topics, and won't be suitable for a younger audience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ms71dctwfNc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d25d96ac680a12d616bea0536de0f899.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ms71dctwfNc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introspect: Reflect on your actions along with the protagonist; exchange your thoughts on what happened; regret or rejoice, grieve or laugh together… or independently of each other.</li>
<li>Choices: There is no “Mission Failed”; saying “No” opens new avenues. There is no golden path.</li>
<li>Consequences: Lie to others, and you’ll be more likely to hide the truth from yourself. Fail to justify your actions and you might find your character not heeding your commands.</li>
<li>Narrative: Sprawling, naturally flowing dialogue: react in intense back-and-forth conversations.</li>
<li>Survive: You must prepare for every journey inland, anticipating the challenges ahead. The provisions are scarce… but the others need them less than you.</li>
<li>You’re NOT fully in control: you are the whisper in the back of the mind. Manipulate your crew-mates and your protagonist into doing your bidding… and deal with the mental toll.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer mentioned over email that the demo will remain up until the end of November.</p>
<p>Try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1387640/Where_Birds_Go_to_Sleep/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine now has its own dedicated Foundation for funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source game engine Godot Engine continues to grow, and now the team behind it has formed a Godot Foundation to continue funding it.</p>
<p>Previously they teamed up with the Software Freedom Conservancy charity, who handled the donations and ensured it was used correctly but as they've constantly grown, they feel the need to run it themselves now. In <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godots-graduation-godot-moves-to-a-new-foundation" target="_blank">a blog post</a> from founder Juan Linietsky, they noted having their own organization gives them the "opportunity to explore broader funding sources" while mentioning crowdfunding like Blender and Krita do.</p>
<p>On top of that, a "highly requested" ability for users to be able to sell assets through some sort of asset library, with a share going to the new Godot Foundation. Having merchandise is also an option and other miscellaneous extra forms of funding.</p>
<p>Linietsky also believes that doing all this will "project a stronger image of the Godot Project, which will allow us to have stronger footing when negotiating big donations with donors". Additionally "we want the Foundation to serve as a home for community initiatives, by allowing it to have its own funding lines (this means, so they can raise funding on their own for a specific goal, but the Foundation receives and uses it according to what was agreed), such as initiatives to promote education, communication and diversity".</p>
<p>All sounds reasonable and just goes to show how popular Godot has become that they can now do this. This is all on top of the formation of W4 Games, which is their company to commercially support Godot that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/w4-games-raised-8-5-million-usd-to-support-godot-engine/" target="_blank">raised quite a lot of money</a> recently.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator recently had a big update with a free Graveyard level</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the most popular games of its kind on Steam, the co-op escape room puzzler Escape Simulator recently had a nice update.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1435790/view/5722411638188322462" target="_blank">Steam post</a> going over stats and plans, they noted they've seen over 1.4 million people try it out on Steam which is impressive. Plus, a Wild West DLC was announced that will release in December adding in 4 new official rooms, 4 new music tracks and new outlaw and sheriff outfits.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1309400171667387697gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1309400171667387697gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the recent free update it added in a free Graveyard room, which they added for Halloween and it came with a special soundtrack too and a new outfit. On top of that they said the update has "600 fixes and quality-of-life improvements for the game".</p>
<p>Have to say, their design in this game is pretty great and the Graveyard felt suitably spooky, although a little over the top with the fog perhaps. They also said they have a few more rooms to add still yet so that should be fun to see, as usually you get all the items to play with in the Room Editor too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13099232891667388907gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13099232891667388907gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Void Scrappers blends Vampire Survivors mechanics with a space shoot &#39;em up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Void Scrappers recently released with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. A pretty great game if you love the mechanics of Vampire Survivors but want something different. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" target="_blank">previously took a look</a> at their Prologue but the full game is out now.</p>
<p>Joining the growing list of horde-survival games, you blast various types of alien ships into junk that you then collect to upgrade your ship and blow up more. Destroy bosses and take their weapons, unlock and equip powerful new abilities and you can permanently upgrade your ship stats between runs too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qq7i-Kb00WI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0cd971a262e18ba801c1f6b703f62406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qq7i-Kb00WI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A note: it seems currently it has an issue on Steam Deck where you might see a black screen while docked, the developer hasn't figured out why it happens but it works fine handheld.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with the Prologue, and that quickly became a favourite. This full release with expanded content will quite likely become a regular coffee-break game for me, or a quick run or two before bed. It's incredibly easy just to pick up and play, has good battery life on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005210/Void_Scrappers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

While based on TTD, OpenTTD had a wide array of improvements including bigger maps, better multiplayer, dedicated servers, better AI and so much more.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck pushed Linux to the highest share on Steam in years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month, which means a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out. Looking over the October 2022 data, it appears we've hit a fresh high point.</p>
<p>At the end of October, Linux hit 1.28% on Steam against 2.23% on macOS and 96.50% on Windows. Going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, where we've been tracking the Linux user share for a few years, it is the highest it's been in over 4 years now! Still tiny compared with Windows of course but it's some clear steady progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14921006971667370820gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14921006971667370820gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This growth at the moment is largely thanks to the Steam Deck, which you probably already guessed. That much is clear when looking over the Linux-specific data page on the Steam Survey which shows these as the top Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 24.98% +7.94%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 12.27% -0.21%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.12% -1.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.92% -0.88%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.71% +0.90%</li>
<li>Other 40.99% -2.00%</li>
</ul>
<p>SteamOS (at least going by that list on face value) is the most popular Linux distribution for gamers on Steam, by a wide margin there too with the caveat being we don't know exactly what's in the "Other" category, which could be full of various forms of Ubuntu that could push it to the top when added together.</p>
<p>When checking further, in the GPU list for Linux, the growth is clear with it noting that "AMD Custom GPU 0405" (the Steam Deck) has hit 25.01% (+7.94%). I should note as well, that this GPU still doesn't even show up when filtering to just Windows and so it's clear that the vast majority of gamers on Steam Deck are sticking to SteamOS which goes to show just how good it is as an experience overall.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress releases December 6 on Steam and itch.io, Native Linux support later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress is finally getting the big Early Access release on Steam and itch.io on December 6, although the Native Linux support is to come along later. Many years in the making, with actual proper graphics and more, it's nearly here!</p>
<p>With Bay 12 Games at the helm and Kitfox Games publishing, no doubt it will be one of this year's biggest Steam releases. New trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2K7T5LXQPJI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50f94258d46f59c5096234037ff352bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2K7T5LXQPJI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About Linux (and macOS) they said this under the "Soonish" heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also not able to approach Mac and Linux by ourselves, since we've never notarized a Mac build or managed Linux libraries, and will need to get help with that to do it properly. But obviously we'd love to get that whole pipeline working so people can play on non-Windows computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an email to us, the publisher additionally noted "support for Linux and Mac is not planned for the initial release, but is relatively high in the priority list after the initial bug fixes/content updates are complete".<em> At release though, I will be surprised if a title like this doesn't work well in Proton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not just generated geometry -- a whole simulated world. Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Now with beautiful pixel graphics!</li>
<li>Learn the basics with in-game tutorials</li>
<li>A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight</li>
<li>Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.</li>
<li>A new endless hobby, just for you!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Beta update tweaks the new Big Picture Mode from Steam Deck for desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3379415101027242699" target="_blank">released</a> a new Steam Client Beta, which amongst other things tweaks the new Big Picture Mode that is also in a special Beta that was taken from the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For the new Big Picture Mode here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed Steam Deck Rewards section from Account page.</li>
<li>Fixed issues interacting with spotlighted games under What’s New.</li>
<li>Forced GPU acceleration on for Linux users who may have disabled it a long time ago. This is needed for the UI to be performant. This can still be disabled with the command-line option -cef-disable-gpu. It can also be forced enabled via -cef-force-gpu.</li>
<li>Temporarily hiding System Info under Settings as a work-around for crashes for users with older NVIDIA drivers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder: to use the new Big Picture Mode you need to launch Steam with "-gamepadui" as a launch argument as I showed in a previous video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ztW9LP8bmvg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9883a0e9dbe34964845eca4b22871e70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ztW9LP8bmvg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue where new Big Picture Mode notifications were showing up in desktop mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign In</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a case where if the sign-in UI had cached credentials which had become invalid, it could get stuck and not accept valid credentials thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Enabling: The "Touch" option is now available to controllers which do not have capacitive touch sensors - Moving joysticks out of their deadzone now counts as a "Touch".</li>
</ul>

      <title>Competitive tactics game Duelyst is being revived with Duelyst II</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love competitive games? How about when they're free to play? Dream Sloth Games are reviving Duelyst as Duelyst II, with approval from Counterplay Games. A game that originally reviewed quite well, but it was shut down and delisted on Steam back in February of 2020. Duelyst II was originally started as a fan-game but it's now turning into a full complete sequel.</p>
<p>They say "The epic battles of Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars have been distilled into focused 10 minute PvP matches, where every decision you make can be the difference between victory and defeat.". It offers up the positional aspects of traditional turn-based strategy games, with "the deep customization and dynamic gameplay of CCGs". So it's a turn-based deck-building battler.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13704578761667313397gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13704578761667313397gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it will be free to play, they're aiming to keep it away from any pay to win mechanics with you being able to "quickly" build your collect by playing with monetization focused on cosmetic items.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SzvqzwIbTdk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e9b885a84b0f41bc61dd3d328f4e89f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SzvqzwIbTdk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Position your units on the battlefield and destroy the enemy General to claim victory in strategic, turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Construct a deck from hundreds of unique cards - use minions, spells, and artifacts to discover new strategies and devastating combos.</li>
<li>Choose from six powerful factions: Lyonar Kingdoms, Songhai Empire, Vetruvian Imperium, Abyssian Host, Magmar Aspects, and Vanar Kindred.</li>
<li>Climb the ranked ladder, compete in draft mode, challenge friends, and solve puzzles to uncover the lore of the world.</li>
<li>An all new Original Soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have full Native Linux support and it is crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamslothgames/duelyst-ii/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the $25,000 goal not only hit they've managed to nearly double it and there's 10 days left on the campaign.</p>
<p>Their current plan is to have an Open Beta this year. They said "Q4" but we're already inside that and they haven't given a more clear date yet exactly. Likely shortly after the campaign ends.</p>

      <title>These were the most popular Steam Deck games for October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1587193499174465536" target="_blank">revealed</a> <em>two</em> fresh lists of popular games for the Steam Deck through October, sorted by both daily average player count and time played overall.</p>
<p>The first is sorted by daily average user count of games released in October which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1496790/Gotham_Knights/" target="_blank">Gotham Knights</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral_Island/" target="_blank">Coral Island</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord/" target="_blank">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/" target="_blank">Victoria 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850510/TRIANGLE_STRATEGY/" target="_blank">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/" target="_blank">SIGNALIS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second, is sorted by hours played total across the whole month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" target="_blank">ELDEN RING</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank">No Man's Sky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/" target="_blank">Fallout 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" target="_blank">Hades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These lists both show just how amazing the Steam Deck is as a device. When it can play games released for Windows, through the Proton compatibility layer, often on the day of release like Persona 5 and UNCHARTED. They were never designed for the system and yet thanks to the work going into Proton, they work so amazingly well.</p>
<p>Then with the second list, you can see another great point, on how people are continuing to play their favourites that were released many years ago. The back catalogue you get access to with Steam and the Deck is just awesome. Just the very fact that some absolutely huge games like GTA V and Skyrim work on it still amazes me. Both lists also go to show just how varied the games are that people play on Deck, there’s seemingly no genre that’s bigger than the other.</p>

      <title>Missile Command: Recharged gets a revamp and relaunch on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari and Adamvision Studios have taken down the original Missile Command: Recharged, and replaced it with another Missile Command: Recharged of the same name but it has been upgraded. It's seen a bump in the price too.</p>
<p>Answering the question of why they decided to re-do it, they said: "To address the elephant in the room: there was indeed an original release of Missile Command: Recharged. Being the first title in the Recharged series' lineup, Atari decided to go back and upgrade the title with all they've learned after releasing six additional Recharged games. Atari's revamped Missile Command: Recharged equips the game with fresh content and a whole new gaming experience, drawing inspiration from later releases such as Gravitar: Recharged, Yars: Recharged, Black Widow: Recharged, Asteroids: Recharged, Centipede: Recharged, and Breakout: Recharged."</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Ups:</strong> Don’t just target missiles – take aim at all-new power-ups that will give you special tool, including powerful missiles, shields, and even a screen-clearing special blast.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> In Arcade, use accumulated points you earn to upgrade defensive attributes that will keep you in the game longer – if you use them wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Local Co-op:</strong> Tag in a friend to play any mode in local co-op and coordinate to fend off enemies even longer.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Compete in global leaderboards and aim to claim bragging rights as the top missile commander.</li>

      <title>Open source kart racer SuperTuxKart 1.4 is out now with Vulkan in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source kart racing game, SuperTuxKart, has released a major new version with lots of fresh goodies to play with. Focusing on fun gameplay and not realistic physics, it could (and often does) get compared to Mario Kart, except it's made by volunteers but it is quite impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307998961667303764gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307998961667303764gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the big new stuff in version 1.4 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Lap Trial game mode.</li>
<li>Items and stars animation.</li>
<li>HiDPI support in SDL2.</li>
<li>Beta Vulkan renderer.</li>
<li>Balanced starting positions in all official soccer fields.</li>
<li>Lots of other smaller balancing changes, track updates and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap between the Vulkan and OpenGL renderer with a "--render-driver=vulkan" or "--render-driver=opengl" launch argument, and it seems to stick to the last one you picked. Currently, Vulkan doesn't seem to have a lot of the graphical effects present in OpenGL so it's very much a work in progress.</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 7.20 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine hackers have put out a new development build of the Windows compatibility layer in Wine 7.20. This is part of Steam Play Proton, which allows you to play tons of Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. Once a year they make a big new stable release, and eventually Proton updates to it too.</p>
<p>Here's the highlights of <a href="https://www.winehq.org//announce/7.20" target="_blank">version 7.20</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 7.4.0.</li>
<li>Font linking improvements.</li>
<li>A number of fixes for exception unwinding.</li>
<li>Support for dumping EMF spool files in WineDump.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>29 bugs were noted to be solved including issues for: Crysis 2, Tequila City of Heroes Launcher, Autonauts, Axiom Verge 2, Obduction, Shin Koihime † Eiyuutan 4 and more.</p>
<p>For those that don't know: Wine Mono is their version of Mono, meant to replace .NET (v4.8 and earlier) in Wine. The improvements in Wine Mono 7.4.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression in string formatting in WPF. The bug is in WPF code but was triggered by an implementation change in Wine's dwrite. (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53552" target="_blank">Winehq bug 53552</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed build on systems that have a "python3" command but no "python".</li>
<li>Fixed build error with glibc 2.36.</li>
<li>Updated the Vagrant build VM to Ubuntu 22.04.</li>
<li>Some work on System.Configuration tests.
<ul>
<li>Nunit tests now use .exe.config files.</li>
<li>Stand-alone System.Configuration tests now run as part of the test suite.</li>
<li>A default case was added to fix a failing test. It's not known if this helps any real application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IL code storing a 64-bit integer to a "function pointer" type field is now accepted. This fixes an Invalid IL error in Grounded.</li>
<li>Imported System.Speech.dll from .NET Core. This does not work yet with Wine's SAPI implementation, but allows for further development.</li>
<li>Updated SDL to 2.24.0.</li>
<li>Updated FNA to 22.09.01.</li>
<li>Updated Mono from upstream.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Video recording app OBS Studio v28.1 out with NVENC changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> has a new release out now, and it comes with some changes for NVIDIA GPU owners who use NVENC. Some of the changes (as usual) only affect Windows, but there's still some goodies in there for Linux too.</p>
<p>Easily one of my favourites bits of FOSS software, couldn't imagine being without it now for video recording and livestreaming, well worth supporting directly!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18936427741667302669gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18936427741667302669gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When it comes to NVENC, in v28.1 they've changed the way you can configure it with quite a lot more options, so you can really tweak what your videos will look like now with this encoder:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Presets have been split into 3 different settings: Preset, Tuning, and Multipass mode</li>
<li>Presets are now P1-P7, lower numbers being lower quality, higher numbers being higher quality. Note that higher presets may incur higher GPU usage which could impact the performance of games running simultaneously with OBS. The number of simultaneous NVENC encoding sessions may be lower when using the highest presets. OBS will automatically map your current NVENC settings to the closest preset when upgrading.</li>
<li>Tuning is used to determine whether to prioritize latency or quality. It has three settings: High Quality, Low Latency, and Ultra Low Latency.</li>
<li>Multipass Mode is used to determine whether a second pass is used in encoding, and has three settings: Disabled, Quarter Resolution, and Full Resolution. Enabling this will give higher quality at the cost of more GPU resource usage.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9197958741667302603gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9197958741667302603gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additional changes for all platforms include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Moved "Always on Top" to the View menu</li>
<li>You can now select a specific source for the Virtual Camera</li>
<li>Fixed Stats widget appearance issues</li>
<li>Fixed Blend Method in Studio Mode</li>
<li>Fixed case where video capture is darkened when both luma wipe and scale filtering are set</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.5 Beta adds Download Manager, external game / launcher installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> is growing with the 2.5.0 Beta version out now, putting it in competition with the likes of Lutris and Bottles a little more with the new features.</p>
<p>One of the major new additions is the ability to add applications from basically anywhere. Heroic is no longer limited to GOG and Epic Games, as you can just add anything in from Native Linux game installs to Windows games / launchers to then run through Wine. This is great since it's such a popular application on both desktop and Steam Deck and should perhaps even make certain launchers easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3012696731667235982gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3012696731667235982gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's now support for custom user themes, a Download Manager so you can queue up a ton of games to download and a "more robust online checking system". They also upgraded the version of Legendary they use, which is the magic behind the Epic Games support along with performance improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>I'll probably take a proper look in a video likely when 2.5.0 is out stable.</p>

      <title>Elon Musk completes Twitter takeover, Nextcloud to ship their own social network app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a bit of big industry news to cover today, as an update to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/twitter-agrees-to-elon-musk-buyout-a-reminder-were-on-mastodon/" target="_blank">previous article</a> talking about Elon Musk and Twitter — as the sale has completed. Plus a reminder on Mastodon and Nextcloud doing some fun social stuff too.</p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way: no, this is not gaming news, but we've covered big industry stuff for years. In this specific case, we (or should I say <strong>I</strong>), use Twitter a lot for sharing our news and interacting with people, spreading info about Linux gaming, Steam Deck and more. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL on Twitter here</a>, our account is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's certainly going to be interesting to see what happens, with changes already underway. For one, Musk said Twitter is now <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792" target="_blank">building up</a> a "content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints" and that the verification process (where you get a blue tick) is also being <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586848033550934016" target="_blank">revamped</a> and they're even <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/elons-first-big-move-pay-to-remain" target="_blank">reportedly</a> looking at charging people to stay verified.</p>
<p>Seems like a good time to remind people of alternatives, like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. We're on it too and have been for a long time now, you can follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL on Mastodon here</a>. It's a little different to Twitter since it's open source and federated, it works a lot more like email: you sign up anywhere, or host your own, and then chat with everyone.</p>
<p>Linking into that, Nextcloud <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/no-need-to-trust-musk-we-go-federated-with-nextcloud-social/" target="_blank">announced</a> their own "Nextcloud Social" platform which will ship in Nextcloud by default, and it will have support for the the Activity Pub standard and Mastodon directly too. That could be interesting, as they have quite a lot of people using it.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader for Steam Deck (plugin loader) gets fixed up for newer SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems each time Valve do a big update to the Steam Deck with SteamOS, it ends up breaking the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> plugin system but a fresh update is out now fixing it again. From what one of the developers said it now works well across the Stable, Beta and Preview update channels.</p>
<p>There's some known issues including Valve breaking some things on the Preview branch that may need you to restart Steam, if you open the Quick Access Menu right after booting / sleep you may not see the Decky Loader icon until you re-open the menu a couple of times and for people using the Animation Changer you need to re-run the installer.</p>
<p>What's Changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add timeout to get tabs request, wait for network online target before booting decky</li>
<li>Merge Tabs and Injection Fixes, bring back native Valve toaster</li>
<li>Systemd service updating</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've not seen it, check out my guide and intro below with a few plugins being shown off:</p>

      <title>Better Linux support for OneXPlayer coming, likely for SteamOS like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We already know that OneXPlayer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">have it in their plans</a> to put SteamOS on their devices, and perhaps this Linux kernel work is a step towards it.</p>
<p>They have just launched the "<a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/products/onexplayer-mini-amd%C2%AE-ryzen%C2%AE-6800u-1920-1200?variant=41877371224244" target="_blank">ONEXPLAYER MINI PRO</a>", which comes with an AMD Ryzen 6800U and a 1920x1200 screen. Expensive though, especially compared to the Steam Deck with this 6800U model coming in at a minimum of $1,199 so it's a little eye-watering.</p>
<p>As for this new kernel work, this new driver allows the Linux kernel to deal with the fan controller and it is currently only supported on AMD chipsets. From the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/20221029225051.1171795-1-samsagax@gmail.com/" target="_blank">patch</a> that was sent in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Platform driver for OXP Handhelds that expose fan reading and control via hwmon sysfs.</p>
<p>As far as I could gather all OXP boards have the same DMI strings and they are told appart by the boot cpu vendor (Intel/AMD).<br/>
Currently only AMD boards are supported but the code is made to be simple to add other handheld boards in the future.</p>
<p>Fan control is provided via pwm interface in the range [0-255]. AMD boards have [0-100] as range in the EC, the written value is scaled to accomodate for that.</p>
<p>PWM control is disabled by default, can be enabled via module parameter `fan_control=1`.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/OneXPlayer-Linux-Platform-Drv" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, gamepad support for the OneXPlayer was already sent in previously this month too. So it really does look like they're gearing up for Linux support.</p>

      <title>Classic Unreal Tournament lives on with a new OldUnreal upgrade, 64bit now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unreal Tournament 99 is one of the all-time great first-person shooters, and it is being kept alive by the <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> team and contributors with a fresh release out now.</p>
<p>Version 469c has been released recently, and it remains compatible with all previous public releases of UT down to version 432. Some of the main highlights of this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the included FMOD Engine binaries for all clients to version 2.02.10</li>
<li>The Windows installer is now digitally signed</li>
<li>Removed libcurl from the patch. Server admins that use the MD5 anti-cheat protection feature and that have automatic updates enabled for the package list will have to manually download libcurl or use the version that came with the previous patch. This change should substantially reduce the number of false positive malware warnings triggered by our patch</li>
<li>Added native support for Linux/AMD64 and macOS/Apple Silicon platforms</li>
<li>Included an updated version of the UT PubSrc SDK</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Love seeing updates like this to such a great retro shooter. There's a lot more to it, that's just the basic highlights. Some awesome maps were in this game, and the feel of it continues to hold up very nicely. I had so many hours of fun playing this many years go. Nice that Epic gave it their approval too.</p>
<p>I previously showed off how to play it on Linux / Steam Deck using ProtonUp-Qt to install Luxtorpeda which then gives you access to the Native Linux release, which you can see a video on below as it makes the process quite easy:</p>

<p>It does need the original data files of course, which you can buy easily on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/unreal_tournament_goty?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13240/Unreal_Tournament_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Great smaller and casual games for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is a great device for the bigger lot (AAA / AA), what about some quality choices for smaller and more casual experiences? Here's my current favourites, good for a cosy Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Okay, <em>casual</em> might perhaps <em>not</em> be the best word. However, my picks here are definitely on the smaller side of the gaming scene but they're really great to pick up and play on the Steam Deck. They're also not overly intense! Just click play and enjoy the ride. Keeping them as close to around £15 or under as I can.</p>
<p>First up, a little video going over each and links below in order:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lui9Us7hjSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b79f55d1ce515a60a0d9bfe9bd9fa82f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lui9Us7hjSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></strong></p>
<p>This one was pretty obvious wasn't it? Much like a vampire, it will dig in and suck your life away while the sun goes down. Having a ridiculously cheap price attached is also pretty helpful here, a fantastic entry into gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748390/Rocket_Bot_Royale/" target="_blank">Rocket Bot Royale</a></strong></p>
<p>An online 2D Battle Royale, with jumping tanks. It's like a real-time worms or the classic artillery games. Quite satisfying to jump around and get a few frags in this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282730/Loop_Hero/" target="_blank">Loop Hero</a></strong></p>
<p>Another that will thoroughly hook you in for many hours. Watch as your hero loops around the screen, while you pause it to equip better weapons and armour and continue on. Then build up your little village, while you get a trickle of backstory.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863080/Beat_Invaders/" target="_blank">Beat Invaders</a></strong></p>
<p>It's like Space Invaders, with sleek neon graphics and some sick tunes. A classic re-invented for the modern age and a thoroughly great experience.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></strong></p>
<p>Another a bit like Vampire Survivors, but with a sentient Potato that carries a lot of weapons as you face off against increasingly large hordes across various rounds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/" target="_blank">Into the Breach</a></strong></p>
<p>Small turn-based tactics that will leave you scratching your head. Difficult but great, from the creators of FTL. You control powerful mechs, against waves of creatures crashing through the floor that try to destroy various buildings. Try to think ahead.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Core Keeper</a></strong></p>
<p>A sweet 2D underground mining and crafting game that you can play in online co-op with others. Dig deep to find riches, do a little farming, discover secrets and take down plenty of creatures and bosses.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></strong></p>
<p>I couldn't not include this right? Probably one of the most chilled and casual games ever made. Do a whole lot of farming, make some friends, possibly meet your lover and turn an overgrown mess into something beautiful and productive.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/" target="_blank">Mini Motorways</a></strong></p>
<p>Build up a road map for a growing city. One by one you drag roads around to create a network, eventually coming to a rather busy metropolis. Traffic not flowing how you like it? Get redesigning and create the most sleek set of roads you can, help everyone get around.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a></strong></p>
<p>Probably one of the cleverest puzzle games I've ever played. Combine logic blocks together, to change the rules of each level so that you can reach the flag to win. Turn yourself into things, make everything float or perhaps turn yourself into the flag itself to win.</p>
<p><u>A bonus</u>: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/" target="_blank">PowerWash Simulator</a></strong></p>
<p>This one is a <em>bit</em> more expensive than the rest, but also one of the most relaxing game experiences I've personally had on Steam Deck. Make everything so shiny you can see your face in it, get down to your hands and knees and get scrubbing. Actually, don't, just pump some water at everything and hope for the best while you sip your coffee.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What games have you found to be great on the Steam Deck, that don't require a lot of thought that you can just sit back with? Bonus points if your picks are cheap too.</p>

      <title>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is another Sony port working well on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony and Sumo Digital recently put out another port, this time it's Sackboy: A Big Adventure an offshoot of the LittleBigPlanet series.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Sony releases, it didn't have a Steam Deck rating before release and still doesn't yet. The good news is that it works out of the box on both Steam Deck and Fedora Linux seemingly without any major technical issues. It does have some shader stutter, which smoothens out over time though (likely as it had no full testing before release).</p>
<p>With Proton 7, it's click and play on Steam Deck and Linux. Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WxdGZQ8ZpvE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb96f8c0f5d6d2dcf810f194b732449.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WxdGZQ8ZpvE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Very happy with how this runs. On my desktop, max settings produced a very smooth experience overall. On Steam Deck, keeping it on High settings, with the screen locked to 40Hz and TDP set to 10 — gave a really good feeling too with better battery life than the default (a good while over 2 hours).</p>
<p>On desktop, it seems it doesn't get along with MangoHud, which vanished every time on the initial loading screen so in the brief desktop bit in the video, you will see the normal Steam FPS counter in the top left corner.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sackboy-a-big-adventure?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599660/Sackboy_A_Big_Adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>VRR (external screens) and Allow Tearing options coming to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that both options for Variable Refresh Rate and Allow Tearing are coming to the Steam Deck in a future update (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yg0ou5/variable_refresh_rate_and_allow_tearing_options/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), here's what that means.</p>
<p>Firstly, no, the Steam Deck itself will not have VRR, as the screen doesn't support it (As confirmed by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1586208015543578624" target="_blank">Twitter</a>). This will be for <em>external</em> screens when docking. The point of VRR is to have your screen continue to dynamically change the refresh rate to match the game, enabling it to remain smooth and tear-free.</p>
<p>As for the Allow Tearing option, this is due to the current way that Steam Deck Gaming Mode works with the Wayland display server, with it always forcing VSync. Once ready, this will allow you to properly have it off, and therefore reduce any extra latency it introduces and get some tearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the new options in the performance menu.</em></p>
<p>Both of these are going to be pretty big and exciting additions, especially for those with VRR capable screens and for times where you really need that little bit extra input performance.</p>
<p>The options turned up in the Steam Deck "Main" updates channel, which is one of the extra update channels you can turn on via Developer Mode not actually meant for users. As with any in-progress developments, it can change at any point.</p>

      <title>Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds gets cross-play between Steam and Consoles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the more unique fighting games available on PC (Native Linux + Steam Deck Verified), Them's Fightin' Herds has launched on consoles and it now has cross-play. This means no matter the platform you want to fight on, you're good to go.</p>
<p><em>The game currently has a Very Positive user rating from 2,578 user reviews.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Released as part of the 3.1.2 update they noted that players can find each other across the matchmaking queue, classic lobbies, and Pixel Lobbies regardless of platform plus some HUD elements were added to identify people on different platforms. However, account progress is separate between platforms. Consoles use Epic Online Services, while Steam is sticking to Steam netcode.</p>
<p>The Season 1 Pass is also now live as a DLC that gives you access to 4 new characters, an exclusive character palette pack and 4 exclusive Pixel Lobby accessories although not everything is out yet. The first of the new characters, Texas, was teased in a short trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oSM20gOntLM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5ad30296488359d25d90b4a56570573.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oSM20gOntLM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, the update also fixed up hosting a custom Pixel Lobby server on Linux.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/thems-fightin-herds?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/574980/Thems_Fightin_Herds/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The third game in the popular Monster Prom series recently landed (that I missed) and this time, it's not a dating sim, instead it's all about survival in Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the dating sim style was never really for me. However, the original in the series <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/in-monster-prom-i-was-rejected-even-after-letting-a-princess-ride-me/" target="_blank">completely won me</a> over and it was a genuine delight to play. Flipping things around this time it keeps the great writing, quirky humour and multiplayer angle along with the diverse set of characters but you need to survive a roadtrip. Although, scoring a date is still possible but not the focus.</p>
<p>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip has you and up to 3 friend face "all kinds of wacky conflicts". Just like the previous entries, it has Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for monster-collecting game Cassette Beasts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an upcoming monster-collecting RPG from Bytten Studio and publisher Raw Fury. The recent Steam Next Fest demo was pretty great and a new trailer is live now for <a href="https://www.mediaindieexchange.com/" target="_blank">The MIX</a> event.</p>
<p>An interesting idea for such a game, with you recording various creatures on retro cassette tapes and the fusion system allows you to create tons of unique and powerful monsters. New trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pydbU0FovBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cc385239eac01f1185e1d710e07d7be1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pydbU0FovBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?!</strong> Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li><strong>Fuse monster forms!</strong> Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a rich open world</strong> Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li><strong>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions</strong> Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li><strong>Master a deep battle system</strong> Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, I took a quick look at the previous demo on Steam Deck recently too:</p>

      <title>Valheim gets an important bug-fix for Linux players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that the survival game Valheim had quite an unfortunate bug for Linux players, which has now been solved.</p>
<p>Players discovered a little while ago, that the ability to move saves between Cloud and Local might end up deleting characters or worlds. Ouch. At least it's fixed now. This update also brings the Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item since it's Halloween season once again.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a Linux-specific bug that deleted characters/worlds when moving them back and forth between Local and Cloud</li>
<li>Prevent joining servers from the main menu if incompatible server version right away (instead of loading and then kicking you back out)</li>
<li>More PlayFab tweaks</li>
<li>Enabled Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put up a fresh Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3394051799812669717" target="_blank">Client Beta</a> with numerous fixes, along with new features like the QR code login you can use with the mobile app. To try it out you need to be in the Beta or Preview update channels.</p>
<p>This update also brings with it an update to the desktop Steam client on Steam Deck, so that you can also now use the Gaming Mode UI in Desktop Mode too which just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-deck-ui-comes-to-desktop-in-beta-to-replace-big-picture-mode/" target="_blank">recently landed</a> for normal desktop / laptop users.

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13105285671666949440gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13105285671666949440gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Steam Deck UI comes to Desktop in Beta to replace Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has finally done what a lot have been waiting for, made the Steam Deck UI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3394051164709183116" target="_blank">available for desktops</a> although it's only available in the Steam Client Beta for now.</p>
<p>To access it open Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; hit the Change button under Betas and select the Steam Client Beta. After that, you also need to add "-gamepadui" as a launch argument. So in terminal on Linux you can just simply run <code class="inline-code">steam -gamepadui</code> for it to work. Or just add it to the end of whatever shortcut you're using, same can be done on Windows too.</p>
<p>For anyone who has been following any Steam Deck footage from me or others, you will know what it looks like by now but here's a couple shots from my desktop running it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4215040561666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4215040561666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260385831666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6260385831666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3145167311666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3145167311666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3853570881666898960gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3853570881666898960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not perfected yet of course, hence it being in Beta and hidden behind a launch argument. One issue I already found (shown above), was that the Steam menu ends up showing whatever I have behind it. Weirdly though, the Quick Access Menu doesn't have that problem.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it will still be called Big Picture Mode but it just gets replaced from the old to the new, taken from the Steam Deck UI design.</p>
<p>Valve say the updated UI includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Home Screen, where you can continue playing recent games, and see what’s new with the games in your library.</li>
<li>New Universal Search, that searches across Library, Store, and your friends</li>
<li>New controller configurator, designed for ease-of-use of picking, adjusting, or creating custom controller configurations</li>
<li>Optimized Steam Store for controller navigation</li>
<li>Updated in-game overlay, with access to achievements and guides
<ul>
<li>Press Steam / Guide / PS button while in game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New system menu, for quick navigation to different parts of the interface
<ul>
<li>Access this with the Steam / Guide / PS button</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New quick access menu, for access to notifications, friends list, quick settings, and more.
<ul>
<li>Access this with Steam / Guide / PS button + A</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a quick run over it:</p>

      <title>Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translator VKD3D-Proton version 2.7 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here is an absolutely huge open source release! <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a>, the translation tech used in Steam Play Proton to translate Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for Steam Deck / Linux version 2.7 is out now.</p>

<p>The new release does have higher graphics driver requirements including Mesa 22.0 or NVIDIA 510 series, which should be easily available in most distributions but the release notes say Proton 7.0 will stick with VKD3D-Proton 2.6 but Proton Experimental and future main Proton releases will jump to version 2.7.</p>
<p>Some of the major additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An improved pipeline cache, now enabled for all games along with it being smaller (helps performance).</li>
<li>Lots of optimizations and better GPU performance for various features.</li>
<li>It now supports D3D12 Mesh shaders and Advanced ExecuteIndirect.</li>
<li>DXR 1.1 had some more feature implemented that were missing.</li>
<li>Basic Shared resources and fences supported with Proton.</li>
<li>Preliminary HDR support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loads more including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix random GPU hangs in Hitman 3.</li>
<li>Fix crash in Redout 2.</li>
<li>Fix random GPU hang in F1 2021.</li>
<li>Fix random flicker in Guardians of the Galaxy.</li>
<li>Update some API checks required by latest AgilitySDK runtime features. Fix crash in F1 2022.</li>
<li>Add various workarounds for game bugs in Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Add workaround for amdgpu kernel issue for certain games using imported host memory and multiple Vulkan devices.</li>
<li>Workaround glitched rendering in F1 2020 due to game bug.</li>
<li>Workaround certain games that violate placed resource API w.r.t. subresource initialization.<br/>
Spiderman Remastered and Lost Judgment are affected. More games will likely surface.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dark Reign: The Future of War, a true classic RTS is being remade in OpenRA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anyone else remember Dark Reign: The Future of War? Released back in 1997, it's a real classic and at the time it had some pretty favourable reviews too. The good news is that <a href="https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign" target="_blank">it's being rebuilt</a> by fans using <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a>.</p>
<p>OpenRA is the same game engine that revived classic Westwood RTS games like Command &amp; Conquer,  Dune 2000 and Red Alert. It's highly versatile and open source, making it a good base to use to revive other classics too and this makes me happy.</p>
<p>Dark Reign is easily one of my all-time favourite RTS games, next to Total Annihilation. Both managed to spice things up nicely that other RTS games around the time weren't doing. Heck, I even wrote about Dark Reign <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2016/11/wine-allowed-me-to-re-live-a-gaming-experience-i-had-from-when-i-was-a-child-on-linux/" target="_blank">here back in 2016</a> when trying it out in Wine (wow — has my opinion on Wine changed or what?). Just look at how gorgeous it was:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17909460541666885980gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17909460541666885980gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893085941666886113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14893085941666886113gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictures to enlarge.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A colossal war between the Imperium and Freedom Guard is annihilating your world. To save your civilization, you must enter the heart of an empire at war. Command over 35 units with specific orders and deploy suicide bombers, hostage takers, saboteurs and more. Use precisely calculated battlegrounds to your strategic advantage and play against a highly responsive and unpredictable AI that detects and adjusts intelligently to your tactics. Vanquish the military powers to alter the destiny of a galaxy.</p>
<cite>The official blurb</cite></blockquote>
<p>I had this OpenRA "mod" on my watch-list for a long time, hoping for the best but I wasn't aware that it was being <em>actively</em> developed. To the point that you can download an AppImage from the GitHub, download the demo content inside it and then get playing and it's really coming along nicely, although far from complete.</p>
<p>What do I hope with this article? Perhaps there's a few fellow Dark Reigns fans lurking that might like it, and perhaps some might help give it a push along with code so we can see another classic truly revived for modern audiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15060194471666886645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15060194471666886645gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Dark Reign in OpenRA.</em></p>
<p>Find the project on <a href="https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It works with the demo assets but you'll likely need a full copy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dark_reign_expansion" target="_blank">GOG</a> at some point.</p>

      <title>Guide a convoy through a ruined world in the Sandwalkers prologue demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sounding a bit like Vagrus - The Riven Realms, we have the upcoming game Sandwalkers from Goblinz Studio and the new prologue demo Sandwalkers: The Fourteenth Caravan. The demo already has Native Linux support, and the full game will too (the developer confirmed this to GOL).</p>
<p>In this world some kind of "meteorological chaos" keeps all the tribes apart, so it seems your mission is to go through a perilous journey and meet up with them all. Manage diplomatic relations, trade, explore, fight and more. Looks like it could be pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Z65VM-utH0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3653fc3248edc65686743fb7dad2d9c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Z65VM-utH0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Guide a caravan of adventurers through ever-changing landscapes.</li>
<li>Fight and survive in the face of acid rain, sandstorms and heat waves.</li>
<li>Tame hostile creatures, rescue refugees, seek allies for mutual aid, or follow the blood path and loot everything you can.</li>
<li>Seek rich arable soil to plant a new tree city for your people.</li>
<li>Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan.</li>
<li>Repair the broken climate, and put an end to centuries of wandering.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goblinzstudio/sandwalkers-a-roguelike-turn-based-exploration-game" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, where the developer is trying to get at least €40,000 and they're off to a good start with over €12,000 pledged and they have 29 days to go. This is the first time they've done a crowdfunding campaign too, as they usually do Early Access on Steam.</p>
<p>At release it will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sandwalkers" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1639080/Sandwalkers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Although the prologue demo only has a Linux version on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966290/Sandwalkers_The_Fourteenth_Caravan/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure McPixel 3 releases November 14th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another point and click adventure? McPixel 3, yes they skipped the number 2, is heading to Linux and Steam Deck on November 14th.</p>
<p>The developer explained that "McPixel 3 runs on 100% software-rendered McPixel Engine, so in the age of unaffordable graphics cards, you can be sure you will be able to run McPixel 3 just fine!</p>
<p>The engine has been written from scratch just for the purpose of running McPixel. That makes the game run smoothly even on the oldest computer, so make sure you install McPixel on your grandma's PC next time you visit! Additionally, that makes the game environment-friendly! McPixel 3 saves the planet (and battery life)!"</p>
<p>A fun part of this is their <a href="https://twitter.com/Sosowski/status/1585329526015684610" target="_blank">thread on Twitter</a> showing the game running across a classic Asus EEE PC 4G, Steam Deck, Windows 95, FreeBSD, Raspberry Pi, in a Linux terminal window, Haiku OS and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5895728741666881396gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5895728741666881396gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - McPixel 3 running in a Linux terminal, credit: the developer.</em></p>
<p>Some pretty amusing and clever marketing that.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Valve finally clears up Steam game release dates, also adjusts pricing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two important pieces of info today for both players and game developers, as it will affect both quite a bit with release date changes and pricing changes.</p>
<p>Firstly, prices! Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3314110913449340511" target="_blank">announced</a> to developers various updates to how they handle multi-currency. Developers and publishers are still free to set their own pricing but now Valve are giving developers a new tool to make it easier, along with adjusting their recommendation on prices across seemingly all currencies on Steam. This may result in price increases across many games on Steam in many different regions, as Valve said "with purchasing power and foreign exchange rates constantly evolving, we needed to make significant changes to those conversion recommendations to stay current".</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as always, keep tracking changes on Steam and did their own blog post to highlight the changes. According to SteamDB the only currencies not changing have so far been CIS - U.S. Dollar, Costa Rican Colon. Israeli New Shekel, Kuwaiti Dinar, Singapore Dollar, South Asia - USD and U.A.E. Dirham. They included various tables, showing the changes against the dollar at various price points with this one showing just how big an increase it can be:</p>

<p><em>Thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. </em></p>
<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3289340571611574692" target="_blank">big change</a> is how release dates are presented on Steam. Soon, gone will be the days of developers setting whatever format they wish for their dates, along with some including funny messages instead of an actual date. Instead, Valve will have a standard way to present dates that can be correctly formatted to your region so there will be no more confusion on days and months too.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a> for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10741759131666866898gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10741759131666866898gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What is changing is that developers will need to put an exact date that only they and Valve can see, and then pick between these types of public views:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The exact date. “Aug 24, 2023”</li>
<li>Month-and-year. “August 2023”</li>
<li>The quarter of the calendar year. “Q3 2023”</li>
<li>The year. "2023"</li>
<li>No date at all. “Coming Soon”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This change makes sense, and was a long time coming.</p>
<p>With this change, it will also affect how developers have their games shown in upcoming lists on Steam. Valve will position games "at the last possible date of that time range", so if developers pick to have just a month and year they will appear as if they select the last day in that month. Hopefully this will also help fix the issue of some developers repeatedly changing their date to keep bumping their game in the upcoming lists.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on the official Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After having and playing with the official Steam Deck Docking Station, here's some thoughts on the experience. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">earlier in October</a>, along with the Steam Deck itself no longer having a reservation queue, I was very keen to see what Valve would give us officially. Especially since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a> already provide <em>great</em> docked experiences for a lower price (since they don't give you a charger too).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15625936341666864552gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15625936341666864552gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>For the basic design it's perfectly fine. All the ports are on the back out of the way, so you only see the short lip at the front when you've docked your Steam Deck. No ethernet wire poking out the side like with JSAUX (although ivoler don't have this issue). There's no problems with the design or build quality at all, except for those of you keeping thicker protective cases on where it won't fit in. It also has a nice non-slip cover on the bottom so it won't move around.</p>
<p>A reminder on what it has available: 3 x USB-A 3.1 Gen1 Ports, Gigabit Ethernet, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, USB-C Power Delivery pass-through input and an included charger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6714503211666864544gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6714503211666864544gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>When you first get it, you'll likely need a firmware update before you really use it. A big benefit of it, is that Valve provide firmware updates directly, so there's no messing with anything external. You either get a pop-up telling you one is available, or you can go into the settings and check for updates to have it appear. It probably won't be updated often but it's still a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9711401061666863019gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9711401061666863019gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So it looks nice and it can get easy updates — how is the overall experience? Well, that's where things aren't so good in this case. I've now used 4 or 5 different JSAUX docks (I've lost count) and one from ivoler, I use my Steam Deck docked all the time and have done since before the original release (since I was an original Steam Deck reviewer) via two different USB-C Hubs, so I think I have a fair amount of experience here.</p>
<p>The problem is that the official Steam Deck Docking Station has its quirks with actually connecting to external displays, tested by connecting to multiple TVs and PC Monitors all from different vendors. Sometimes, it works right away. Most of the time though, I have to do a little dance between powering the Steam Deck down and on again, turning screens on and off and so on. Unfortunately, for me, the official Docking Station is very much <em>not</em> a plug and play experience. Sadly, I am apparently in a long list of people having issues with it. Looking on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/3?snr=1_614_steamdeckdock_steamdeckdock_1601" target="_blank">Steam Forum</a>, there's a great many posts of people seeing the same or just not seeing a signal on their external screen at all. A few in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">our Discord</a> have also reported such issues too.</p>
<p>At 4K, the Steam Deck UI acts a bit weirdly too. Things don't always match up on the screen and the UI doesn't perform well. Thankfully, Valve added external screens settings so I can put it into 1080p and it works fine while still looking good overall. Not a big issue but one I hope they sort too.</p>
<p>Since Valve has put a lot of work into the docked experience, overall once it's actually setup <em>correctly</em> it works quite nicely. I have no big main complaints about the main docked experience right now. Bluetooth controllers both PS4 and Xbox work just fine, as do controllers plugged in via USB. Honestly, playing with the Steam Deck while docked is a really fun experience and really continues to show how versatile the Steam Deck is as a gaming device. However, I really do hope Valve add an easy way to deal with external drives as more people wish to use them to expand their storage even more. It's possible to do, like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-jsaux-m2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-is-a-great-choice/" target="_blank">JSAUX M.2 SSD Dock</a>, but the setup is annoying to do. They have the functionality there for SD Cards, so it's not a stretch to say they could expand that for other external drives too.</p>
<p>If Valve manage to sort out the issues with it connecting properly to external screens, which is the <em>main</em> function, it might turn around into a recommendation. For now though, I would suggest going with JSAUX or ivoler instead and if you already have a spare charger, you'll be saving money too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CD PROJEKT RED announce The Witcher Remake in Unreal Engine 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a big fan of The Witcher series you will probably love this: CD PROJEKT RED have announced The Witcher Remake. Working together with developer Fool's Theory, it will be developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>This is what was originally teased as "Canis Majoris", it will be a modern reimagining of the classic from 2007 and it "will use the toolset CDPR is creating for the new Witcher saga" — sounds fancy. Hopefully it will release in a better state than Cyberpunk 2077, with Fool's Theory having veteran developers who previously worked on The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and CD PROJEKT RED is providing full creative supervision. Fool's Theory have also contributed to the development of Baldur’s Gate III, Divinity: Original Sin 2 DLC’s, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, Outriders and Gord.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p><em>"The Witcher is where it all started for us, for CD PROJEKT RED. It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it is just as big, if not bigger</em>," said Adam Badowski, Head of Studio, CD PROJEKT RED.<em> "Collaborating with Fool's Theory on the project is just as exciting, as some of the people there have been previously involved in The Witcher games. They know the source material well, they know how much gamers have been looking forward to seeing the remake happen, and they know how to make incredible and ambitious games. And although it will take some time before we're ready to share more about and from the game, I know it'll be worth the wait."</em></p>
<p><em>"I am very happy that my professional paths have crossed again with fellow developers from the time of working together on The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 3. Especially when it's a remake of a project that is so close to our hearts," said Jakub Rokosz, CEO, Fool's Theory. "We are excited to join forces with CD PROJEKT RED, and our goal is to give players another great game from the iconic Witcher series."</em></p>
<p>Hopefully whenever it releases, Proton will run it nicely on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Although, perhaps by the time it's out we might have a Steam Deck 2 as no doubt it is quite a long time away from release.</p>

      <title>JSAUX cancels current Steam Deck Dock with RGB, after competitor pinched it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX were getting close to release another (yes, another) Steam Deck Docking Station, this time with RGB lighting around the bottom but due to a "leak" and a competitor "copying" it they have cancelled it and will re-do it.</p>
<p>Outlined in a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/blogs/steam-deck/statement-on-product-leaks-and-the-new-rgb-dock" target="_blank">blog post</a>, JSAUX mentioned: "Today we are here to announce some irritating and disappointing news. In the past few months, we were dedicated to develop and test a new RGB Steam Deck Dock long awaited by our fans, and we are almost to release it. Unfortunately, someone leaked and copied our development scheme.".</p>
<p>They sent out samples to select few outlets to try it and give feedback, with GamingOnLinux (hello) <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1581207438145224707" target="_blank">being one of them</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18078343251666799574gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18078343251666799574gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - the original JSAUX RGB Steam Deck Dock.</em></p>
<p>In the blog post, JSAUX showed off what they say are shots of them designing it back in July, along with a patent application for it.</p>
<p>According to JSAUX, an unnamed company reached out to various Steam Deck content creators and told them about their RGB Dock. JSAUX caught wind of this, investigated and claim they found it was the factory they were using that leaked their files on it thus allowing a competitor to make it and so they have now "terminated the cooperation" with said factory.</p>
<p>As a result, the current design has been cancelled. However, for RGB fans, the good news is that JSAUX will still be doing it but "will start with a completely new look with different lighting effects".</p>
<p>I reached out to the company in question (who I won't name, since JSAUX didn't either), since I know who it was, and they simply denied it completely.</p>

      <title>EA begins swapping out Origin for EA app on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the time has come, EA has begun the process of swapping from Origin to the EA app on Steam, which could cause a few issues for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. Multiple titles on Steam got updates within the last day, with no patch notes or announcements from EA that I can see. The only difference seems to be introducing the EA App.</p>
<p>Checking my existing install of The Sims 4 on Steam Deck and it seems fine. It briefly showed a new EA App screen, then showed Origin and then went into the game.</p>
<p>An existing Titanfall 2 install on Fedora Linux (desktop) however refused to initially launch, it gave me the EA screen and with Proton 7.0-4, Proton 7.0-5 (RC) and Proton Experimental it just wouldn't launch. Removing the compatdata folder, where all the Wine / Proton prefix data is stored and reloading got it a bit further, to some sort of blank EA App screen after successfully installing it that got stuck. Killing all Wine processes and exiting Steam, then reloading Titanfall 2 and after a few blank EA App screens appeared and vanished — it works again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9827645101666779604gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9827645101666779604gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Let's not.</em></p>
<p>With a fresh install of Titanfall 2 on Steam Deck with Proton 7, it had the issue again of a blank EA app screen that got stuck. Quitting and reloading, it once again showed the blank EA app screen. Forcing Proton Experimental on it, and then it actually worked.</p>
<p>Trying a new install of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on Fedora Linux (desktop) with Proton 7, and a similar issue as the above although it didn't need a compatdata folder removal. EA App seemed to install, then I just got greeted by a blank EA App window. Seems it's actually a sign-in window, as I was able to highlight things on it by trying to drag things out of the window. Anyway, in this case simply quitting and reloading just seemed to fix it.</p>
<p>So it's a bit of a nuisance and acts differently between games, but it appears the EA app <em>can</em> still work with Proton but it <em>might</em> need a little extra work.</p>
<p><em>Note: the below can remove settings, possibly saves etc, do at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>If you find you also need to remove the compatdata folder for some EA games (for Steam Deck, be in Desktop Mode): find the Steam App ID (Right click a game -&gt; properties -&gt; updates) or grab the ID from the URL of the Steam store page for it. Then inside your steamapps folder you will find compatdata and inside a folder with the same ID. Where it is depends on what drive you have games installed on, the default is <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/</code>.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments how things are going for you on various EA games on Linux desktop / Steam Deck now.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 6,000 games marked Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just short of two months after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-verified-and-playable-hits-5000/" target="_blank">hitting 5,000</a> — Valve has now marked over 6,000 games as formally Verified or Playable for the Steam Deck.

<p>In other (good?) news, Valve <em>finally</em> marked Paladins as Unsupported, after leaving it saying it was Playable even though it was broken by Easy Anti-Cheat for months. I definitely want them to react quite a bit quicker to games being completely broken and this was a prime example of the issues they face with game updates and Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory announced with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory is the first paid expansion to the chilly survival game from Hinterland. It was announced just recently and a teaser trailer is up.</p>
<p>With this being the first extra paid content since the game came to Steam in 2014, it should be interesting to see what they've been cooking up for it. As a reminder, they're going to be splitting the game up between the episodic story mode and the survival mode (existing customers keep both).</p>
<p>The big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/3387295765245751414" target="_blank">announcement</a> covers a lot of the details and is worth a read but in short it's an Expansion Pass that will come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three new Regions, connected by the long travel zones and hub region. The first of these Regions, “Forsaken Airfield”, and the travel zones all launch with the Expansion Pass. The other two Regions will be released over the course of the 12-month campaign.</li>
<li>Three Tales, narrative-themed Challenges that take place within your Survival game, each revealing insights into the Far Territory’s mysterious history.</li>
<li>New gameplay systems including: Handheld Shortwave, Travois, Safehouse Customization, Trader, Complex Recipes for Cooking, and new Item Variants. We’ll share more info about each of these features on the larger Expansion Pass site we’ll be launching closer to release.</li>
<li>20+ minutes of new Survival music (10+ minutes included in the first Drop).</li>
</ul>
<p>Free updates will still be coming and this is their current plan for free updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full global loot and wildlife refresh. We’ve redone all the loot tables, all the pre-placed loot, and rebalanced the loot economy across the entire game. The Resource refresh will go live for all players when the Expansion launches, and the full Wildlife refresh will come some time next year.</li>
<li>Visor Notes. You’ll be able to find notes under visors (and other locations) that point to supply caches and other useful things, hidden all over the world.</li>
<li>New First-Person animations. We’ve added a whole bunch of new animations for harvesting actions, and more.</li>
<li>Thermos. You know — to keep your drinks warm.</li>
<li>Visual enhancements (focused on high-end systems).</li>
<li>Burdock, a new edible plant.</li>
<li>Improvised Crampons, so you can make them yourself. Watch those ankles!</li>
<li>...and a range of enhancements to existing systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those lists are only some of what is to come, more to be revealed later. Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pc47uXSOLEY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d622452303b03ffda48e162a5b049f02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pc47uXSOLEY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will cost $19.99 at launch, plus a bundle discount for existing owners of the game, and will launch sometime in December.</p>
<p>Sounds like it has done well too, as they revealed some player numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam (paid): 4,000,000</li>
<li>Xbox (paid): 750,000</li>
<li>Xbox Game Pass (subscription): 2,000,000</li>
<li>PlayStation (paid): 500,000</li>
<li>PlayStation+ (subscription): 1,300,000</li>
<li>Switch (paid): 68,000</li>
<li>WeGame (paid): 125,000</li>
<li>Epic Game Store (combo paid + give-away): 1,500,000+</li>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets an official Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short Beta period, Return to Monkey Island from Terrible Toybox and Devolver Digital now has a Native Linux port available. Sounds like the game is doing well, as said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2060130/view/3389547565085212657" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "Thanks to you, loyal customers, Return to Monkey Island is now the fastest-selling Monkey Island game EVER! At least, I think so. My sales data is a little "fuzzy." But let's go with it!".</p>
<p>"It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.</p>
<p>Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAlDNn43QQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f958408d5ffd2ee1ff2f6a26be8bd30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAlDNn43QQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great to see them deliver on it just as they said they would for those who appreciate the direct Linux versions.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>

      <title>Victoria 3 is an ambitious society sim that will engross you if you let it</title>
      <author>BTRE</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Development Studios’ latest game depicts a century of history with a focus on economics and society. Facing the challenges of a changing world can be daunting but the game is good at letting you play at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Key provided by Paradox</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039858541666641152gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039858541666641152gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When I first booted up Victoria 3, I was greeted by optimistic, celebratory images that seemed to portray a world where anything could be possible. The preselected nations, categorized neatly in various sorts of tutorials or guided experiences, describe problems and background of each but all invariably have a tinge of hope in a better future. Even after several dozen hours playing the game, dealing with messy wars, social unrest, industrialization and colonialism, I find that initial impression has stuck around.</p>
<p>The map is probably the prettiest yet in a Paradox title with the art direction really hitting all the right notes. Things like major rivers, lakes, islands, mountains and other major features more or less accurately-represented around the world as delicate clouds float by, wisps of smoke rise from volcanoes, and the occasional signs of wildlife. Signs of civilization are also depicted with cities growing, railways extending and trains running about, and mines and industry popping up as you build them up. It’s a pleasure to look at even when zoomed out, as the map takes a more paper-like look and trade routes and country names appear.</p>
<p>All of this gives an impression that there’s many parts to the whole. And, make no mistake, this is a complex game. It, in fact, revels in its complexity; adjusting tariffs on exported goods, bolstering support for groups such as industrialists in order to pass legislation, and making sure your citizens have not only basic goods but can purchase luxury goods are all the meat of the gameplay. With that in mind, the game seems content to let the player figure things out at their own pace: the world continues to run more or less in sensible ways even without the player there to steer things along. Through the various in-game tutorials and guidance, the tool tip system, and good old fashioned trial and error I was able to come to grips with how things work.</p>
<p>The heart of the game is how it portrays its society. The population is broken down into Pops which are units that represent the class, education, ethnicity and the like. These are not necessarily politically active but those that are will support various interest groups such as landowners, the clergy, or trade unions. Depending on their clout and whether or not they are part of the government, it may affect which laws can be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7931070881666641149gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7931070881666641149gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Good management makes most political realities feasible and stable. When the population’s various needs aren’t being met, it opens the door to radicalization. Enough of that and there may be demands for reforms like, say, implementing limited voting rights. And, well, those with clout and in-power who benefit from the way things are will be against that sort of thing. So pushing through any sort of change can quickly become hazardous—political instability may lead to rebellions and secessionist movements. Figuring out how to keep your country from devolving into chaos while continuing to expand the economy or your nation’s borders is a tough balancing act.</p>
<p>The tension in between potential economical and social reform makes for interesting gameplay and it’s not just the obvious big things like ending serfdom or universal suffrage that can cause a stir. More than once I found myself with long periods of tension and civil war when I pushed too hard or too fast in any given direction and had to back down and accommodate my interest groups in order to not fracture my country.</p>
<p>There is a varied bag of tools and ways to shape things in the direction that you may want over longer periods of time. Laws allowing for secret police to keep radicals down will help the more polarized things are but more subtle tools like suppressing or bolstering interest groups are also available. Incidentally, those tools are lost the more open your society becomes. Something like protected speech means that the government can no longer use some of its more heavy-handed approaches. The events that pop up from time to time with issues of the day (like a mine collapse) become a handy way of placating (or radicalizing!) parts of the population.</p>
<p>Managing the economy is something else that’s a continuous balancing act. On the one hand, growing the resource and industrial base as large as you can in order to be able to afford a large army or provide for a large population is an obvious goal. On the other, focusing too much on any one area can make things harder in the long run: being the top producer of steel is great and all but without investing in administrative buildings it’s difficult to run the country and without universities it’s difficult to find qualified workers for more modern production techniques, let alone keep up with technological research. As you might expect, those things aren’t exactly directly profitable. And go too far with certain industry and your population may not be able to afford staple goods anymore and … what’s that? In the meantime the nation has fallen into debt and has to pass higher taxes to fix its budget issues which can quickly radicalize the population which, in turn, introduces more problems into the equation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6557602081666641151gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6557602081666641151gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Supply and demand drive growth as might be expected but things like the economic laws set in place may allow for subsidizing industry and for collecting tariffs on import or export routes. Basic, extractive, industries remain relevant all throughout the game although they may be modernized like all other industries. Part of the challenge is figuring out what to manage and when as there are often trade-offs to consider; using new techniques may create greater output but may require additional resources like coal or oil and optimizing by automating and reducing the workforce is great—so long as those unemployed laborers can find other jobs and not radicalize. I’ve experimented a lot in various short games I tried and have come to understand a fair deal over the many hours I put in. Although I’m certain there’s a lot more that I have yet to learn. I couldn’t even begin to venture on whether or not there’s an “optimal” way of playing as the circumstances of each nation affect how the economy develops.</p>
<p>That each nation has its own resource limitations is one of the main drivers of conflict and colonization in the game. This conflict isn’t usually war, however. Instead of declaring war outright, nations engage in what are termed “diplomatic plays”, a stated objective against a nation such as taking a state, forcing it to open up its markets, becoming a protectorate etc. It proceeds by phases and nations which have an interest in the region may take sides (or be swayed to take one by promises of something). Things only escalate to a war if neither side backs down and things like mobilizing troops can serve as a bluff to get others to concede. Once mobilized, however, nations can’t demobilize until their conflict is over and, worse still, may convince others that they need to intervene militarily, which may unexpectedly turn a trifle into a real costly mess.</p>
<p>It’s a clever system but not without its flaws. I found that the AI is a little too easy to sway if a little groundwork is done between plays, such as raising relationships. In essence, if a big-hitter country is trying to intervene somewhere, it is too easy to get another great power to intervene on your side and, if war breaks out, bear the brunt of the fighting. While 19th century was the century of the balance of power doctrine as best exemplified by disastrous interventions like the Crimean War, it is still odd to see a nation like France intervene against the UK in the Opium Wars instead of joining in to take a slice of the Chinese market for itself.</p>

<p>Ideology also seems to not really factor in; reactionary countries will intervene in favor of revolutionary ones and vice-versa in a manner that doesn’t quite feel like Bismarkian Realpolitik. Given that in the game’s time period covers the height of imperialism, the rise of (and reaction to) socialist politics and, later, fascism, it can feel a little jarring. As an example: mismanagement and internal conflicts drove me to adopt socialist policies and become a council (i.e. soviet) republic. There was an attempt at an undemocratic counter-revolution that escalated to a civil war. Austria, which had managed to remain an absolutist monarchy, took my side against its ideological bedfellows because I offered them a relatively unimportant concession. I avoided a prolonged civil war and Austria got an "obligation" from me which it used to call me into an minor conflict later on. I clearly won that exchange.</p>
<p>Likewise, I like the war system and its abstraction, overall, but find that there are strange aspects to it that likely need more tweaks. It’s a more hands-off system with mobilized troops being under the command of generals who attack and defend along fronts as best as they can. I am fine with the loss of tactical control because things like technology and personality traits go a long way in determining outcome. What I take issue with is how there’s very little intermediacy in the scale of conflicts. In other words, local conflicts don’t really exist and colonial powers will send their largest armies almost every time, often into places far from their origin like Africa or Asia to fight.</p>
<p>I’ve also failed to see any sort of World War 1-type conflicts that involve the whole world and millions of casualties happen, even when multiple great powers participate. Casualties are not nearly high enough and the stakes that are fought over aren’t large enough—there is a lack of postwar negations for particularly large conflicts. It may run counter to the diplomatic play system but the time period depicted by the game also had one of the most consequential conferences in history: the Paris Peace Conference that lead to the Treaty of Versailles. The changes to the world order went beyond the prewar stated aims. So even when larger conflicts erupt, their results feel anticlimactic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17283015011666641150gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17283015011666641150gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There’s also not enough that makes each country have its own unique feel beyond economics and laws. Yes, that does make each session play out differently but in terms of general objectives it’s much more directionless. The little potential direction that is there left me wanting more. For example, there are conditions for unifying Germany as one of the powers in the region. Another for restoring the emperor to power in Japan. Yet another for the potential fracturing of China. But these feel tacked on rather than part of the core identity of each—what drove them to act in a certain way in history beyond simple economics or vague notions of prestige or power. It’s a sandbox game, I understand, but there’s little of the atmosphere that lead to specific approaches.</p>
<p>Another strange omission, I think, is that colonialism is just treated in a rather matter-of-fact way. Setting up colonies is a matter of having the law in your country, declaring an interest in a region and hitting a button. Rarely this may lead to a war with the nation whose territory you are stealing. It is an uninteresting execution. Given that issues that concern interest groups and the characters that lead them may see events and choices, it feels odd that there isn’t anything like it for colonial management. In fact, the only event that I saw along those lines was when another colonial power attempted to rile up the natives against me. It’s not only strange that the natives have no real representation in terms of events but also that your own Pops don’t have their own events regarding their stances on the colonies especially given that all sorts of other political movements and stances are of concern to them.</p>
<p>The computer opponents are fairly competent despite my complaints about some of their oddities. They expand and secure their interests with relish and compete with the player on many fronts and are eager to pursue hegemony not only economically but diplomatically by signing treaties and pacts of all sorts. Still, overall, I’d have to say that ultimately Victoria 3 is a game that you are playing against yourself. What matters the most is your own population and economy and all that’s going on beyond your own borders is of secondary concern. It’s a game that lets you play at your own pace, with your own level of understanding and get something out of it.</p>

<p>With all the caveats and complaints I may have about some of the design implementations, I think that the fundamentals of the games are solid. Despite some of my complaints that boil down to “I wish there was more content,” its a game that has content galore as-is. Though I crossed the 20-hour mark without really realizing it, the 40-hour mark with pleasure. Even late last night I found myself playing more while trying to wrangle all of my thoughts into coherent form for this review. While I’m not sure I’ve managed to explain clearly, I think I’ll say that it’s easy to forgive the imperfections I’ve encountered on account of its polished and appealing core gameplay.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there’s nothing else quite like Victoria 3 out there. It may not be the perfect society simulator but it’s certainly a very ambitious one and I’m grateful that it doesn’t try to run away from that fact. It is a game as optimistic in its presentation as it is the belief that its players will enjoy themselves the more they immerse themselves in it.</p>
