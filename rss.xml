      <title>System76 COSMIC Alpha 7 is out with new accessibility features, global shortcuts and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 continue building up their desktop environment COSMIC, with a 7th Alpha release now available for testing built on top of Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS alpha.</p>
<p>Even though I'm firmly happy with the latest KDE Plasma, because it does everything I need, I'm still quite keen to see the finished product when it comes to COSMIC as they're doing some pretty interesting stuff with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/81687771745594081gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/81687771745594081gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13011144371745594083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13011144371745594083gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 7</em></p>
<p>In the latest release they've tweaked Workspaces so you can click and drag them around and you can pin them to ensure they stick around even when empty too. There's also various new accessibility features they've highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic/issues/811" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">High Contrast Mode</a> uses a high-contrast theme affecting various elements for easier visibility — calculated automatically by COSMIC’s theming system using a specialized method.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-settings/pull/1062" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Color Filters</a><strong> </strong>add a filter to address common forms of colorblindness: Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia. For those with sensitive eyesight, a grayscale filter is also available.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-comp/issues/895" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Color Inversion</a> changes theme colors using a different calculation for the purpose of helping those affected by colorblindness differentiate between like colors.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-settings/issues/653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mono Sound</a> aids those with hearing loss by combining left-right sound channels into a single channel for both ears. We plan to add more accessibility features to COSMIC in future releases!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also improvements to the magnifier, global shortcuts for applications even when they're not in focus, improved fractional scaling for XWayland, there's a new <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/issues/220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">seek ahead search</a> option for their file manager, new sound settings and lots of bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening set for a public playtest May 9-12 but the anti-cheat concerns me for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is set to release on June 10th, and to ensure their servers are working well they've announced a major public playtest will go live in May.</p>
<p>The Beta Weekend is due to be live between May 9th - 12th. You can already request access right now, by going to the Steam page and hitting the Request Access button:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16934378931745590520gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This Beta has no NDA, so anyone playing it will be able to share all the details. During the event you'll be able to play through the first 20 hours of the game which gives you "most of Act 1 of the story".</p>
<p>They'll also be giving away Beta access keys during the Global Dune: Awakening LAN Party Broadcast on May 10th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="63gMIwsCJhM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa6dd4d30df9bd9ade06cf7606d9f3f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/63gMIwsCJhM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do have one <strong>major</strong> <em>concern</em> for anyone hoping to play it on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck, which is the anti-cheat situation. The store page doesn't actually list any, but it appears to be using BattlEye (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2995470/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). So unless Funcom actively choose to enable it, this will result in another game that doesn't work for us.</p>
<p>Even if the Playtest works, we've seen plenty of times before where a Playtest / Beta worked and the main release did not. So it will be good to get a firm answer on this. I've tried to speak to Funcom and their press teams, but no one has yet replied to confirm or deny if the anti-cheat will be enabled for us. <em>I've bumped up some emails about this again today, will update on any reply.</em></p>
<p>At least from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/dune-awakening-looks-like-it-may-be-playable-on-steam-deck-benchmark-tested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the benchmark on Steam Deck</a>, it looked like it might be <em>playable</em> from a performance point of view.</p>
<p>Once we do know, it will be listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Love board games and pure chaos? Fortune Avenue is a new spin on Monopoly out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, Fortune Street is the latest game from Binogure Studio (City Game Studio, Sneak In) that puts a fresh, fast and chaotic spin on the classic Monopoly. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>In the game you take turns to move across a board filled with surprises and opportunities. Each player participates in random game-changing events (there's over 30 of them) that can really mess with everyone. The added randomness really makes it feel different to classic Monopoly, like Jail being replaced with an ice floe that could transform into a luxury cruise and Free Parking instead being an airport that allows strategic movement across the board.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2bxPmjeBtgU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/051ee50a61e55592bed544d096ef020e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2bxPmjeBtgU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can play it offline against AI bots and other people and you can also play online too. You can even play the game as a team if you fancy a bit of co-op against others.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned the Early Access period will last for probably around 2 years, so they can really polish it up and add in new features, although it's already a complete experience to play through. In their current roadmap they plan to add in custom game modes, a board editor, more customization, Steam Workshop support and much more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Board Elements: From melting ice floes to bustling airports, every corner of the board holds a surprise.</li>
<li>Strategic Rule Voting: Every 12 dice rolls, players vote on new rules that can drastically alter the game's dynamics.</li>
<li>Speed Up Mechanism: A helicopter targets the poorest players, ensuring a fast-paced game that minimizes frustration.</li>
<li>Elimination Bonus: Gain a $100K bonus for each player you eliminate, adding a competitive edge.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Measures: With physics-based dice and wheel of fortune, plus advanced obfuscation and VAC, the integrity of the game is maintained.</li>
<li>Rich Multiplayer Experience: Peer-to-peer connectivity with a robust recovery mechanism ensures seamless gameplay.</li>
<li>Diverse Game Pieces and Boards: Choose from 12 unique pieces and explore 4 different themed boards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lost For Swords is a unique deck-building dungeon crawler that&#39;s different each time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of dungeon crawlers and deck-builders but Lost For Swords manages to come off a little more unique thanks to the way it shuffles everything together. I had a really great time with some early versions of this one, played it for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Each floor is made up of cards, which are shuffled together with your currently built deck of equipment cards and then placed randomly across the board for you to explore. As you move from tile to tile, you'll pick up your equipment but you only get to use each item once. So a lot of Lost For Swords is about managing the individual steps you take, a game of tactical planning on deciding your route and how to best deal with each enemy. It's really interesting to play!</p>

      <title>Replicube is an open-ended programming puzzle game about making 3D voxels</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Walaber Entertainment LLC (JellyCar Worlds, Parking Garage Rally Circuit) have just released Replicube, an open-ended programming puzzle game where you make 3D voxel-based objects.</p>
<p>Could serve as a fun and interesting way to get yourself or others into programming and test your knowledge. A truly nerdy puzzle game that's for sure. Check out the Steam trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UFFW4NlNnLg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0196353bf41f1aa5f1226597ed249001.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UFFW4NlNnLg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SOLVE PUZZLES - The main content of the game involves trying to match a reference object by working out code that will replicate it.  There is no "right answer", if your code produces the same object, it's correct!</li>
<li>PLAY AROUND - You can always open the voxel tool in "free edit" mode and just play around, making whatever you want.  In addition to the main 3D voxel editor, there is also a bonus 2D image editor for writing code to generate 2D images and GIF animations.  You can even save your image creation as the background image in the "OS" interface of the game!</li>
<li>JOIN THE COMMUNITY - Every puzzle has 2 leaderboards, measuring source code size, and execution efficiency. Often optimizing for one will be at the expense of the other.  If you enjoy trying to squeeze a bit more out of your code, the leaderboards are waiting!</li>
<li>There is also an in-game online forum where players can share their own voxel creations, and even challenge other players to try to recreate them, all presented in an old-school online forum wrapper.</li>
<li>EXPORT YOUR CREATIONS - Generated 3D voxel objects can be exported into common formats to bringing into other 3D creation tools. Generated 2D images and animations can also be exported as png or gif for sharing online.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The release arrives with Native Linux support and it already has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders launches later this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders from Homo Narrans Studio is now on the road to release, with it being confirmed a GOG and Steam release will happen this year with Native Linux support. I originally wrote about this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/check-out-the-new-demo-for-casebook-1899-the-leipzig-murders/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2022 when it had a Kickstarter</a> and it was planned for 2023 but took longer than expected.</p>
<p>Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders is a richly atmospheric, retro-inspired point-and-click adventure that immerses players in a rarely explored chapter of European history. Set in Leipzig, Germany at the dawn of the 20th century, the game invites players to step into the role of Detective Joseph Kreiser as he investigates a string of mysterious murders across the city. As Kreiser, you’ll examine clues, interrogate suspects, and piece together evidence in a classic point-and-click format enhanced with thoughtful design.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YkVFgW99dqA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8ac6989b094aa7a9fb547cc2ac927aa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YkVFgW99dqA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"The release of Casebook 1899 – The Leipzig Murders is an enourmous milestone for me personally," shared solo developer Gregor Müller. "After four years of dedication, learning, and countless late nights, I'm proud to share my first commercial game with the players."</p>
<p>One to put on your watchlist if you love the classics.</p>

      <title>FBC: Firebreak from Remedy releases June 17, aiming to be Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for people wanting to play Remedy Entertainment's new game FBC: Firebreak, as it's releasing June 17th and it will be playable on Steam Deck (and so Desktop Linux too thanks to Valve's Proton).</p>
<p>I did email the developer to ask about if it will run, and if they planned any <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>, which could have caused problems but they didn't reply. However, they did recently do a developer livestream where the confirmed very clearly how they're aiming for it to be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The Communications Director, Thomas Puha, was mentioning how it will run on lower-spec PCs. Then the Game Director, Mike Kayatta, jumps in to note "Steam Deck as well". After that the Community Manager, Julius Fondem, notes they're "aiming for Steam Deck Verified, that was very important for us".</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is a cooperative first-person shooter set within a mysterious federal agency under assault by otherworldly forces. As a years-long siege on the agency’s headquarters reaches its boiling point, only Firebreak— the Bureau’s most versatile unit—has the gear and the guts to plunge into the building’s strangest crises, restore order, contain the chaos, and fight to reclaim control.</p>
<p>Dive into the Federal Bureau of Control’s (FBC) unpredictable and extradimensional headquarters during its darkest—and strangest—hours. As one of the FBC’s fearless first responders, you and your team are on call to confront everything from reality-warping anomalies to otherworldly monsters... no matter the odds. Will you contain the chaos or finally lose control?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remedy have said they will continue to expand it after release. In the press release they said "All future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins".</p>

      <title>Lenovo - Legion Go S with Valve&#39;s SteamOS gets a price increase at Best Buy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Best Buy have recently increased the price they're listing for the two upcoming Lenovo - Legion Go S models with Valve's SteamOS. They seem to have taken down pre-orders too, with it now just being listed as "Coming Soon".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The new prices could be pretty off-putting. Here's the new USA pricing (credit to cdubbsworld on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1k7d6va/leigon_go_s_steamos_price_hike_again/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-go-steamos-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-nebula/6619192.p?skuId=6619192" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AMD Ryzen Z2 Go</a> edition is now $599.99 before it was $549.99.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-steamos-32gb-with-1tb-ssd-nebula/6619188.p?skuId=6619188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</a> edition is now $829.99 before it was $749.99.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? The most probable reason are the mess of <em>tariffs</em> going on right now (thanks Trump). Prices of lots of things have been all over the place due to it. This isn't even the first price increase. Originally, Lenovo said they<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> expected it to launch for $499.99</a> for the Z2 Go edition — $100 is quite a big bump now from their original plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18783169831745574668gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Both models are listed as releasing on May 25th.</p>
<p>At this point, it <em>might</em> just be better to stick with the tried and tested Steam Deck directly from Valve. For the price, it's not like Lenovo are giving you much more than what Valve already do with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED</a> top model being $649.</p>

      <title>More games for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming for April 25th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for April 25th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA disclose new security flaw in their Linux GPU drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA sent out a security bulletin today to reveal a fresh security flaw found in their Linux GPU drivers. So it’s time to get updating again to be safe.</p>
<p>Noted down as CVE‑2025‑23244 here’s their explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow an unprivileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a number of different driver series, so you’ll need to check what you’re currently on to see the best version upgrade. If you’re on any of these you’ll be fine: 535.247.01, 550.163.01, 570.133.07 and 575.51.02.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5630/~/security-bulletin%3A-nvidia-gpu-display-driver---april-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA website</a>.</p>

      <title>Frostrail from the devs of Barotrauma &#39;eager&#39; to support Linux with a &#39;tentative yes&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Barotrauma devs FakeFish recently revealed Frostrail during the Triple-I Initiative event, and they're giving a "tentative yes" for Linux support. Swapping out a submarine and cold ocean for a train and frozen wasteland, Frostrail is a ruthless open world survival FPS where you have to carefully manage your train to keep pushing forward.</p>
<p>Speaking in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3517740/view/520837698904129747" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said this about Linux support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Will Frostrail be MacOs/Linux compatible?</strong></p>
<p>One of our developers is primarily working on Linux, and we are eager to open Frostrail to the Linux gaming community. So that’s a tentative yes at this point at least for Linux. Our number one priority is making the PC version smooth and stable for Early Access release, and Linux/Mac support is also kept in mind every step of the way. However, we can only fully confirm support for these OS upon release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The publisher, Shiro Games, recently revealed that it amassed over 100,000 wishlists on Steam only 4 days after the reveal. Clearly there's a lot of interest in this one!</p>
<p>It will enter Early Access in 2026.</p>

      <title>Discord CEO steps down, replaced with former Activision Blizzard CSO as they work towards being a public company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Discord forces in more adverts and paid customization towards becoming a public company the CEO and Co-Founder, Jason Citron, has announced they're stepping down as CEO.</p>
<p>Citron will be moving to become a member of the Board of Directors and Advisor to the CEO. The new CEO, starting from Monday April 28th, will be Humam Sakhnini who worked at Activision Blizzard as Chief Strategy Officer and later King (developer of Candy Crush Saga).</p>
<p>There's been a lot of mixed reports on Discord's plan to become a public company, with this now actually being directly confirmed by Citron in the announcement <a href="https://discord.com/blog/passing-the-torch" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> noting that Sakhnini was hired to "lead Discord through our next chapter of growth and someday becoming a public company".</p>
<p>From the separate <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-appoints-new-ceo-humam-sakhnini" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“Building Discord over the last decade has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. From the very beginning, our mission has been about bringing people together around games. It’s a mission I’ve dedicated my career to, and I'm confident that passing the torch to Humam is the right evolution for Discord's future. His deep gaming industry expertise and proven track record of scaling businesses while fostering genuine friendships through play and shared experiences positions us perfectly for our next phase of growth. I believe this transition will accelerate our momentum and unlock even greater possibilities for Discord, our consumers, partners, and the overall gaming ecosystem in the years ahead.” — Jason Citron, Discord Co-Founder</p>
<p>"I want to express my sincere gratitude to Jason Citron as he moves into a new role on the Board of Directors. We’ve worked together closely for more than a decade, and Discord is the product of his incredible vision for a new company that could redefine how gamers connect. The fact that the company has scaled to reach and delight millions and millions of people is a testament to the power of that vision. I’ve known our incoming CEO Humam Sakhnini for many years as well, and I’ve long admired his work and strategic thinking. I believe he is the ideal leader for this new phase of Discord’s history, with his deep understanding of the game business generally, and particularly the nuances of customer acquisition and modern revenue creation which are so important in today’s game business. I am looking forward to working with him to help realize Discord’s long-term potential.” — Mitch Lasky, Discord Board of Directors </p>
<p>“I'm incredibly excited to join Discord at such a pivotal moment. Discord stands as a massive, foundational part of the gaming ecosystem that millions of players, developers, and publishers rely on every day. What Jason and Discord co-founder and CTO Stan Vishnevskiy have built is truly remarkable — a platform with an undeniable product-market fit where hundreds of millions of people connect around their passion for gaming and shared interests. I look forward to working with Stan and Discord's talented team to scale our business while staying true to the company's core mission and the special connection it has with player communities. We're still at the beginning of gaming's impact on entertainment and culture, and Discord is perfectly positioned to play a central role in that future.” — Humam Sakhnini, Incoming Discord CEO</p>
<hr/>
<p>We all know how going public goes right? Let the enshittification commence (er — continue?). For now, Discord at least still works quite well, but I have a lot of concerns about how their work towards going public will ruin Discord as we know it.</p>
<p>What happens if it really does go bad? Where does everyone go for chat then? There's not exactly many other actually <em>good</em> (and modern feeling) options that have the range of services Discord provides.</p>

      <title>11 bit studios are remaking the original Frostpunk in Unreal Engine 5 with Frostpunk 1886</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios have announced today that their popular city building survival strategy game Frostpunk from 2018 is getting a remake in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Why? Well, they no longer develop their own in-house game engine they called "Liquid Engine" and Frostpunk 2 also uses Unreal Engine 5. They said they've wanted to continue working on the original Frostpunk, but their old engine was showing a lot of limitations. So they're going back to the start with Frostpunk 1886.</p>
<p>They said it's not just a plain recreation though. It will have "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer" and serve as a "great introduction to the world of Frostpunk for newcomers, but also a title that die-hard fans of the game would love to play on repeat". They also have plans to add in "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings" and more. 11 bit studios are also finally looking to add in official mod support too.</p>

<p>It will release sometime in 2027. The current version is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, and works well on desktop Linux with Proton (Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/323190?device=pc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>).</p>
<p>Personally, I've still not had the chance to actually play it. I don't even have a copy of it. Am I really missing out on something here? Let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Polterguys: Possession Party is a funny competitive party game worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Polterguys: Possession Party from Madorium Ltd is a party game that's highly competitive. As a bunch of ghosts, you and friends are trying to get away from a monster, so you need to sabotage everyone else to survive. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Since you're a ghost, you need to fly around and posses various items to gain just a little protection. While your friends are doing the same, it's a game of last ghost standing. Speed is not the key, tactics are, you're trying not to get caught while ensuring everyone else does. You get various powerups to help with that, and each level has a different mechanic to help you try and trap others or hide from the monster.</p>

      <title>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS fixes issues with AMD FSR3 on Steam Deck and adds a Photo Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KOEI TECMO recently released a small update for DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS that released in January, making it more playable on Steam Deck. Valve have currently rated it Steam Deck Playable. It's not Steam Deck Verified yet, as some of the in-game text is a bit too small.</p>
<p>With Ver. 1.0.0.7 released April 23rd, the developer fixed up some graphical distortions on Steam Deck when you enable AMD FSR3. Nice to see direct support for issues like this.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2384580/announcements/detail/527592442371768338" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional Features and Adjustments</strong><br/>
• Added Photo Mode. To start it, open the menu on the World Map or in battle and press the TouchPad button.<br/>
• Added Lion Dragon Armor as an outfit for the protagonist. You can try it on by selecting Change Outfit at your current base.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br/>
• Fixed an issue causing graphical distortion when AMD FSR3 is enabled on Steam Deck.<br/>
• Fixed minor bugs.<br/>
Note: Controller buttons have been labeled according to PS5 console standards.</p>

<p>It's currently 18% off on Fanatical. Not the lowest it has been but close to it so seems like a good deal if you wanted to pick it up right now.</p>

      <title>Check out the unique demo for Insectile, a bug-catching creature collection game with puzzle-battles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Insectile is an upcoming game that blends together exploration, creature collection and puzzle battles into what looks like quite a unique and charming experience. It will have Native Linux support and a demo is now available.</p>
<p><em>I've been getting some classic retro Pokémon vibes playing the demo but with a unique spin on it. </em></p>
<p>Here you're exploring giant gardens to find various different types of bugs that you store in jars, to bring them out during combat. The combat side of it is where the puzzle element to it comes in, as the battles aren't just plain attack versus hit-points. Instead each "Insectile" (what they call the creatures) have a different shape, and you need to slot all of yours onto the board of enemies to fit together to attack.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gbjJ445F_oI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/597a47f09522d31f102327f39268f733.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gbjJ445F_oI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo is but a small taste, but I'm keen to see more from the full game on this one.</p>

      <title>Time-travel adventure Old Skies from Wadjet Eye Games is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest point and click adventure from Wadjet Eye Games is out now with Old Skies sending you through time. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: "Fia Quinn is a time traveler, accompanying clients of the ChronoZen Time Travel Agency on jumps to other eras to make sure they don't rewrite important aspects of history. Some of these people are merely curious. Others have unresolved business. As long as they can pay for the trip, their motivations don't matter to Fia... until they do. Jump with Fia into seven time-travel cases spanning two centuries, from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the vicious gangs of the Gilded Age to the World Trade Center on September 10, 2001. Solve temporal problems, survive paradoxes, and resolve the mistakes of the past or die trying -- as many times as it takes."</p>

<li>High resolution 1920 x 1080 graphics! That's 3x higher than Unavowed.</li>
<li>Lots of puzzles that require temporal thinking to solve.</li>

      <title>Colony building sim Mountaincore is now free to play and open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A complicated history for this one, with the developer Rocket Jump Technology no longer existing as a business. The previous iteration of the game named King under the Mountain went open source <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/king-under-the-mountain-mountaincore-went-open-source-as-developer-shuts-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in January 2024</a>, and now what was to be the big revamp is also open source.</p>
<p>Still a shame what happened. In short: the developer made King under the Mountain, then an unnamed "well-known" publisher came in with funding to greatly improve and expand it but they had to re-launch it under a new name (Mountaincore). The publisher eventually backed out, but allowed the developer to continue with the funded work and still release it. Early Access wasn't enough to keep Mountaincore going, so they eventually shut the studio.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19218592071745410823gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Having both versions of the game now open source is a great outcome though, another big project for people to learn from and perhaps continue elsewhere.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Start with 7 dwarves but you can build and support a population of hundreds.</li>
<li>A simulated world with changing weather and seasons that have a big impact on gameplay.</li>
<li>Every one of your settlers has their own needs and desires to fulfil as they work together for the common good.</li>
<li>A deep crafting tree that leaves no natural resource unused, tied together into satisfying production chains.</li>
<li>Progress through skill tiers to craft better tools and weapons.</li>
<li>Trade with merchants to increase your wealth even further.</li>
<li>Form up and train your military to battle monsters and invaders...</li>
<li>...or play in Peaceful Mode to chill out with a relaxing city-builder experience.</li>
<li>Twitch integration (using viewer names for settlers) to encourage stream audience interaction.</li>
<li>Built "Mod-first" so that everything is moddable.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/rossturner/mountaincore" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Since it's under the MIT license, you can do pretty much anything with it.</p>

<p>Coming sometime soon to Early Access, Melvor Idle 2 has been announced by developer Games by Malcs. Building upon the success and popularity of the first game, but with some big new features to hook you in.</p>
<p>The developer said: "Melvor Idle 2 is a direct sequel to Melvor Idle, with almost every single area upgraded or enhanced in some way when compared to the original. We have taken everything we’ve learnt from Melvor Idle and cranked up the dial in hopes to create an experience that far surpasses the original. Melvor Idle 2 introduces brand new Skills, increases base game level caps, reworks existing Skills and completely updates the visual aesthetics to give a whole new look and feel."</p>
<p>Interestingly, this time they've completely changed how they make the game too.

      <title>Stone Age co-op farming &amp; life sim Roots of Pacha gets a major &#39;Sun and Moon&#39; v1.3 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roots of Pacha is basically like a Stone Age version of Stardew Valley, a co-op farming and life sim from Sofa Den. The Sun and Moon update is a big one and it's out now. The game has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More about the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore the Mograni Mountains and Yakuan Islands, two new regions with three subregions each, learn new practices and rituals, and see the majestic sights of the neighboring Mograni and Yakuan cultures that built them. </p>
<p>The stars will align to form new Ideas like ironworking as well as new mechanics like bug catching. Dig deep into an intertwining cave system opened by hidden sigils that unlock new Pachan possibilities and unveil ancestral secrets. Learn about the other clan’s ways of living by joining their sun and moon festivals, playing “Dice” with the Mograni, and performing music with the Yakuans.</p>
<p>Travel to the lands of the sun to find flora like Rye, Lentil Seeds, and Soaproot to create life-altering inventions like the soap processor. Tame new fauna in the lands of the moon, like dodos and pandas. Expand your own Pachan world with these clan’s ways. Foster harmonious coexistence by helping each clan develop their own Ideas for growth. Meet new characters, including new romance options like the Mograni silver fox, Azkel, and Sayra, a Yakuan resident recovering from past heartbreak.</p>
<p>Trade with new friends for fresh outfits, discover the art of setting sail on a raft to fish, and decorate your home with new goods from the Mograni and Yakuans to live the Pachan life like never before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FrHLB9qGL5k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa54e6f08d178aafe4a65bf6a90db929.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FrHLB9qGL5k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The journey of making Roots of Pacha has been an incredible experience,” said Timothy Dadone Nasello, Co-Founder of Soda Den. “We’re grateful to everyone who’s been a part of it, and especially to the community that formed around it and that, just like the game, wonders about our human origins and the limitless possibilities of our curiosity.”</p>

      <title>Mesa NVK (NVIDIA Vulkan driver) now Vulkan 1.4 conformant on Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand has announced a nice big milestone for the open source Mesa driver NVK, the NVIDIA Vulkan driver, as it has expanded Vulkan 1.4 conformance to now include Maxwell+ (Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs).</p>
<p>NVK was already working for Turing and above, so this will bring support all the way back to GPUs released in 2014 like the GeForce GTX 750 and GeForce GTX 750 Ti. Plus the GeForce 800M mobile series, GeForce 900 series and GeForce 10 series. <em>A lot of GeForce 700 series cards are on an older generation though including Fermi and Kepler, more on that below.</em></p>
<p>In a blog post they've said that the current plan is to now have NVK enabled for all of them going with Mesa 25.1, which is due to release in early May. However, they're currently waiting on Mesa 25.2 before they switch those GPUs over to using Zink (OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan) by default.</p>
<p>Support may come to even older GPUs too. For Kepler, they need to add in compiler support, but they said "the driver generally works" already and work has already begun to enable it but it's likely quite some time away so no promises are being made. Fermi is more challenging to do due to the age of it, so it's "hard to predict whether Fermi support will happen at all".</p>

      <title>Steam will soon list what accessibility features games support on store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally. Something many have been asking for Valve to do for a long time now, and something I've pointed out multiple times across various articles - Steam pages will soon list what accessibility features games support on store pages.</p>
<p>Valve announced the upcoming change in a Steamworks Developer post, noting that they'll be giving developers time to fill out some extra questions on what their games support.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This will include features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gameplay options, like adjustable difficulty.</li>
<li>Audio accessibility features, including custom volume controls and narrated game menus.</li>
<li>Visual accessibility features, including adjustable text size and color alternatives.</li>
<li>Input options, which include chat speech-to-text and text-to-speech.</li>
</ul>
<p>They don't say when store pages on the web and inside the Steam Client will update to show it other than sometime later this year.</p>
<p>There will be new store search options so you can look for games that have specific features like text sizing options, saving anywhere and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19289220721745398302gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19289220721745398302gol1.png"/></a><br/>

<p>And how these features will look on store pages when it all goes live:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5411413461745398303gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5411413461745398303gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Credit: Valve</em></p>
<p>I'm <strong>really</strong> happy to see this. Especially playing across different systems, having games with tiny text is just annoying me more and more as time goes on. Even more so on Steam Deck with the smaller screen. Being able to search directly for games that let me scale it up will be wonderful. Hopefully plenty of developers will fill it out, but it's <em>not</em> actually required of developers to do so.</p>
<p>The community site <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> has already added support for the new accessibility tags too in their search. Nice.</p>

      <title>Valve continues preparing the Steam Deck OS to release for more devices with SteamOS 3.7.4 Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamOS 3.7.4 Preview is out now and it contains only a few bug fixes, but one sounds pretty darn important to give non-Steam Deck users a good experience.</p>
<p>We still don't know exactly when Valve will release the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">promised SteamOS for more handhelds</a> yet, but it's coming along with each new SteamOS Preview release bringing some work towards it. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/valves-steamos-3-7-3-preview-improves-support-for-asus-and-lenovo-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Beta</a>, for example, had improvements for Asus and Lenovo handhelds.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in SteamOS 3.7.4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from earlier 3.7 releases wherein corrupt Steam installs would fail to automatically self-repair in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying some incorrect GPU metrics in level four.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bootloader crash on certain non-Steam Deck devices, including qemu-based virtual machines.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered revealed, it&#39;s out now and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bethesda Softworks today officially revealed and launched The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, after days of leaks. And from what they've revealed, I'm very excited to give it a go. It's even Steam Deck Verified right from the get-go with Valve verifying it against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>Bethesda teamed up with Virtuos for the remaster using Unreal Engine 5. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wFJ3PZuAjK4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dbff383f4fab22e4620374d985b9406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wFJ3PZuAjK4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The official bit from Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered modernizes the 2006 Game of the Year with all new stunning visuals and refined gameplay. Explore the vast landscape of Cyrodiil like never before and stop the forces of Oblivion from overtaking the land in one of the greatest RPGs ever from the award-winning Bethesda Game Studios.</p>
<p><strong>Rediscover Cyrodiil</strong></p>
<p>Journey through the rich world of Tamriel and battle across the planes of Oblivion where handcrafted details have been meticulously recreated to ensure each moment of exploration is awe-inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Navigate Your Own Story</strong></p>
<p>From the noble warrior to the sinister assassin, wizened sorcerer, or scrappy blacksmith, forge your path and play the way you want.</p>
<p><strong>Experience an Epic Adventure</strong></p>
<p>Step inside a universe bursting with captivating stories and encounter an unforgettable cast of characters. Master swordcraft and wield powerful magic as you fight to save Tamriel from the Daedric invasion.</p>
<p><strong>The Complete Story</strong></p>
<p>Experience everything Oblivion has to offer with previously released story expansions Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine, and additional downloadable content included in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a huge fan of Skyrim, completing it numerous times, I never was able to get into Oblivion (although it's been a long time since last trying it). Looks like this will be a great time to give it a proper go in completed upgraded form and it does look <em>gorgeous</em>. This doesn't just look like a remaster, it's practically a full remake based on everything they talked about during the livestream announcement.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's a standard edition for £49.99 and a Deluxe Edition for £59.99. The Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Digital base game</li>
<li>Unique digital Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon Armors, Weapons, and Horse Armor Sets</li>
<li>Digital Artbook and Soundtrack App</li>
<li>Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine story expansions</li>
<li>Additional downloadable content: Fighter’s Stronghold expansion, Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair, Mehrune’s Razor, The Thieves Den, Wizard’s Tower, Orrery, and Horse Pack Armor</li>
</ul>

      <title>Civilization VII 1.2 is out with multiplayer teams, the one more turn game mode, new resources and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest update to Sid Meier's Civilization VII from Firaxis Games is out now with version 1.2 bringing some major new features, and a whole lot of enhancements to make this latest game in the series feel just a bit more finished.</p>
<p>With the update they've added in ten new resources to find including Mangoes, Clay, Flax, Rubies, Rice, Limestone, Tin, Llamas, Hardwood, and Wild Game. Each comes with their own effects and narrative event too. Resource distribution is a bit more randomized with new placement login to keep things a bit more interesting too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/279769721745331255gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The One More Turn mode is live, for people who wish to keep on playing after finishing the Modern Age. This lets you experiment a bit more, earn other victory types and see their cinematics too.</p>
<p>Food and population growth also got some developer "TLC", so they overhauled it as they "heard you loud and clear on this one". In short they said the impact with this update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Food-focused strategies are finally viable all game long. </li>
<li>Food-focused civs and leaders like (looking at you, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/pachacuti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Pachacuti</u></a>) will feel stronger and more fun to play.</li>
<li>AI behavior has improved, since they can now leverage high-Food starts and avoid bottlenecks that used to limit their expansion. You may find you even need to turn your difficulty settings down a notch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A major new feature is the addition of Multiplayer Teams. Something that felt odd to be left out really for this type of game. Now you can "play co-op with a friend or have a showdown with multiple teams facing off against each other". Details include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Teams share visibility with each other, along with relationships, war status, and alliance status with other leaders.</li>
<li>When one player wins a victory, the whole team also wins that victory.</li>
<li>Teammates can perform Diplomatic Actions with each other, with the exception of Espionage Actions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it's a bit different to previous Civ games, as you don't share Tech or Civic progress, so your play time is still a bit unique.</p>
<p>There's also lots of other balance improvements, AI upgrades, UI improvements and much more. For Linux players they also "Addressed several input issues" and on Steam Deck they also made a few UI tweaks to improve the flow too. See all in the full <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Expand and rearrange your inventory, watch numbers tick up and break the game in LOOTPLOT</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have no idea what actual genre LOOTPLOT belongs in, or how to properly describe it. You go through rounds of sorting through your inventory and expanding it, trying to create crazy synergies and keep increasing your points needed to beat each level. If you love watching numbers go up constantly, it's definitely for you. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you pick a starting Cat, each with their own different bonuses. There's 12 Cats in it right now, including the tutorial cat. Then the game presents you with a small board of inventory tiles and your starting items. Each round you need to hit a specific amount of points, which you accrue based on your inventory items being activated in a set order from bottom left up to top right.</p>
<p>Positioning all the items is key, as are the slots themselves with lots of different types that have bonuses. You also expand your inventory space with various types of slots as the rounds and levels go on, eventually building up a huge board.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11914284201745327391gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11914284201745327391gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - LOOTPLOT running on Kubuntu Linux</em></p>
<p>It reminds me in a way of inventory management games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a>, blended with a bit of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/ballionaire-is-annoyingly-good-and-i-want-to-play-it-all-the-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ballionaire</a> for the constant flow of points and general craziness.</p>
<p>The tutorial is a bit deceptive on how easy it is, just to show you how nuts it can end up when you progress through it. The actual main game is a fair bit more challenging to hit the points score needed to complete each level. Still somewhat on the easy side though.</p>
<p>From my time spent with it I can definitely see myself playing endless hours of this, to see just how ridiculous I can get it to be with the points system and see if I can make some crazy loops. A great casual game just to relax with.</p>
<p>The game is currently in Early Access with the developer noting it won't be long before it's finished with them estimating only around 3 months. It has basically everything to be a complete game already, but they plan to add in more items and possibly even a PvE or PvP mode eventually.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Slavic folklore Deathless. Tales of Old Rus improves text sizing on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together a collectible card game, roguelike, and turn-based strategy game Deathless. Tales of Old Rus looks like a must-have for fans of titles like Slay the Spire. Now it should be a better fit on Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Starcom: Unknown Space improves the UI and controller support ready for Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starcom: Unknown Space from Wx3 Labs, LLC has a fresh upgrade out now that brings in numerous improvements to the UI and controller support, as the developer hopes to get it Steam Deck Verified. <em>Valve currently have it rated Playable.</em></p>
<p>About it: "Starcom: Unknown Space is an action adventure RPG of space exploration, ship building and fast-paced tactical combat. Enter a vast open-world universe filled with alien factions vying for power, strange worlds to explore, mysteries to investigate, and a sinister enemy that threatens the galaxy with an ancient power."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZBUKGmZo4-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/39c4d31f358286e9a97ed12b9d639090.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZBUKGmZo4-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the game getting a Native Linux version was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/starcom-unknown-space-arrives-in-december-linux-support-a-high-priority/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally</a> a high priority. However, Proton has come a long way, so their updated <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1750770/discussions/0/3497635239410938010/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> notes it's still a goal but not high priority since it works well with Proton.</p>
<p>As for the "Kepler 21530 Controller / Deck Update", the developer said the "main goal of this build was to prepare the game for Steam Deck verification". Here's all the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1750770/view/529844242184405524" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improvements</a> it pulls in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deck/Controller Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Save &amp; Load menus to enable all functionality via controller inputs, including toggling selections for delete, deleting old autosaves, etc.</li>
<li>When text scaling is set to maximum (set by default on the Deck) all text should be a minimum of 9 pixels high at 1280x800 resolution.</li>
<li>Eliminated areas where scaled text overlaps other UI elements.</li>
<li>Dropdowns now keep current selection in view when using controller.</li>
<li>All text input fields should bring up the virtual keyboard on the Deck.</li>
<li>Now possible to toggle highlight, fog in map mode.</li>
<li>Research panel correctly keeps research selection in view.</li>
<li>In cases where there are two scrollviews visible (such as the ship log), right stick scrolls the first, dpad scrolls the second.</li>
<li>Cargo screen allows for quickly analyzing items and proceeding to the next.</li>
<li>Improved input handling in the shipyard.</li>
<li>Chromaplate swatch customization now works with controller.</li>
<li>Crew help should correctly reference controller inputs instead of keyboard if the controller is being used.</li>
</ul>
General fixes:

<ul>
<li>If the player has set a "design goal", the trade screen previously did not show shortfalls in the faction's own reserve currency. Now it does.</li>
<li>Rendering optimization when in map mode.</li>
<li>Several minor typos.</li>
</ul>

      <title>A-RED Walking Robot is a 3D physics puzzle-platformer where you control a wind-up toy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A-RED Walking Robot looks like it could be an interesting puzzle-platformer. You control a wind-up robot toy, tasked with getting through a workshop full of different trials.</p>
<p>There's no release date for it yet, but the developer recently announced Linux support is now available for the Steam Playtest. The developer said it's a "A miniature nerve-wrecking/patience-proving journey where you are granted to fall… a lot". More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pilot A-RED, a charming wind-up robot, as you face the ingenious trials set by its creator in a fascinating workshop full of challenges, surprises, and enemies.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of different physical mechanics and precise control, you must overcome multiple challenges: master balance skills, solve intricate mazes, move objects with your tiny hands, shoot lasers to move obstacles, defeat enemies, use electricity to activate switches, and even fly with your jetpack to cover great distances!<br/>
<br/>
But nobody said it would be easy; A-RED’s vital energy comes from its wind-up mechanism... Can you keep it always running?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a bit of longer early gameplay the developer put up below:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LIBRITOPIA: Librarian Simulator is a game that based on the name, probably doesn't need an intro. As part of a wave of these simulator games (there's suddenly quite a lot of them), here you manage a library.</p>
<p>Coming in with the March 27th major <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3372420/announcements/detail/523086487782162770" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> that also added new book storage options, a proper Native Linux version of the game was also added. You can view the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ue-esnaeg7g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55e0a6c49851083adc93bec3e4685719.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ue-esnaeg7g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A world of books to explore! - Receive, sort, and organize the greatest classics of world literature the way you prefer! From Shakespeare to Flaubert, including Jules Verne and Machado de Assis: in Libritopia, you'll find all the must-have classics for any library!</li>
<li>Organize the space your way - Name your library, expand its size, and furnish the space! Set up the environment by placing shelves or using furniture to create corridors. Add labels to each shelf to classify books by genre, author, year, country, even color - or any other way you want! It’s YOUR library.</li>
<li>Librarians unite! - Work with friends in multiplayer mode to manage the daily demands of your library. Divide tasks and collaborate to meet all the visitor's needs!</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the visitors! - Ensure all visitors can access the books they want! Manage check-outs and book returns, assist visitors with finding books on the shelves, and make sure your library is a peaceful place. No cell phones allowed! Shhhhhh!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is currently in Early Access with the developer noting it will take around a year to finish it. Currently it's £5.89 / $6.99 / 6,89€ with the developer mentioning they do plan to increase the price as it gets more content and features.</p>

      <title>A retro goodie rebuilt from 1994, Ironseed 25th Anniversary Edition recently added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ironseed from 1994 is not one I'm familiar with, I only know if I had seen it when I was small I probably would have played it for hours. Ironseed 25th Anniversary Edition is a modern 2020 remake and now it has a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: "The player begins with a single ship and a chosen crew. Planets are randomly generated and numerous ship designs and crew selection allow for different playing styles. Technology research, space exploration, resource management and gathering, production, crew management and alien diplomacy are essential elements. New ships, new upgrades, and ancient artifacts help the player in their efforts. Combat can be both in the form of random encounters or planned for by the player. Ironseed has been compared to Star Control, Starflight, Masters of Orion, Space Rangers, and Captain Blood."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g0nAbsOEO6U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ec5b0ad6c131002b2a92f305e23a3a75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g0nAbsOEO6U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1412980/announcements/detail/533220039674824025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> was launched March 28th that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rebuilt application using Unity 6.</li>
<li>Added linux build.</li>
<li>Fixed auroras rendering in wrong layer sometimes.</li>
<li>Fixed Next/Previous buttons in local system display.</li>
<li>Fixed lights in main scene and local system interfering with each other.</li>
<li>Fix selection box texture alpha channel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see retro games getting a new life and on more platforms too!</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where changes to notes could be lost when offline.</li>

<p>The screenshot issue was an annoying one, it happened to me a few times when trying to gather shots from my Steam Deck. Nice to see it solved now.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grumpy Rock Studios recently updated Confronted, an interesting sounding survival-horror game where you have to build up little safe rooms. It's in Early Access with the latest update making it playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the Patch 14 <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2882610/announcements/detail/511829843667583073" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned "Confronted should now be playable on your Steam Deck! I've aimed for a smooth 30+fps. There's also a new 'Performance mode' in the graphics settings, which can boost your FPS by 30% or more. This is auto-enabled on the Deck. Other noticeable updates include an overall volume increase for the audio mix, an engine upgrade and performance improvements across the board."</p>

<p>Full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>General</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>500MB reduction in size of the game.</li>
<li>The text 'Dorinela' has been added to the beginning of some voice lines.</li>
<li>All sliders in the menus are now faster with Controller.</li>
<li>Updated News on the main menu.</li>
<li>Portcullis gates now fall more quickly.</li>
<li>Intro logo now 4k.</li>
<li>The underlying engine for Confronted has been upgraded from UE5.4 to UE5.5. This may have some minimal performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong><u>Bug fixes</u></strong>
<ul>
<li>Brightness adjustments in the menu now carry over properly when playing.</li>
<li>Chapter 2 &amp; 3 as 'coming soon' now show after finishing Chapter 1.</li>
<li>Fixed rare chance of enemies not continuing their chase when seeing the player.</li>
<li>Fixed rare chance of enemy getting stuck looking at a hideout.</li>
<li>Fixed case of game freezing if near a hideout during a hunt in the crypts.</li>
<li>Fixed rare chance of getting a duplicate enemy spawn.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<u><strong>Audio</strong></u>
<ul>
<li>Overall sound mix increased in volume by about 20%.</li>
<li>Adjusted some SFX volumes (mostly lowered) for a better overall mix.</li>
<li>Updated death SFX.</li>
<li>Disabled WMFMedia plugin. Electra is used instead for media playback.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<u><strong>Performance</strong></u>
<ul>
<li>Performance mode is now available in the Graphics settings. This enables FSR for 30%+ fps boosts.</li>

<li>Lumen uses global instead of detailed lighting. No noticeable difference in visual fidelity.</li>
<li>Global illumination and reflections use High scalability instead of Epic, with no noticeable difference but better performance.</li>
<li>Some environments have been converted to instanced static meshes.</li>
<li>Optimised shadows on some lights, translucent effects and materials on meshes.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<u><strong>Steam Deck</strong></u>
<ul>
<li>Now playable on the Steam Deck at a smooth 30fps.</li>
<li>Currently cutscenes are played as an image instead of a movie, as I am unable to get videos working on the Deck. Hopefully this can be rectified in the future.</li>
<li>Performance mode is automatically enabled for the Deck but can be switched off still in the menu graphic settings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve have yet to give it a rating but it's nice to see direct testing. That video issue is an odd one though, likely some sort of codec support problem.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is nice. With the price of so many things going up everywhere thanks to tariffs, inflation and everything else - ROCKFISH Games have reduced the pricing of the upcoming big EVERSPACE 2 Wrath of the Ancients DLC. <em>They also only just recently reduced the priced of the previous Titans DLC too.</em></p>
<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/524214742651240614" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they developer mentioned "With events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general. You feel it, we feel it, and all those marketing emails we’ve all been hammered with talking about prices going up certainly don’t help." and so they've decided to slash the price of Wrath of the Ancients from $29.99 down to "$24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99 / ¥2970 (other regional pricing will be in line with Steam guidelines)".</p>
<p>They said that no content has been cut from the upcoming DLC, and they're in the middle of polishing it up ready for the May 12th release date.</p>

<p>EVERSPACE 2 is currently rated Steam Deck Playable, and works on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Supernatural school-life tactics RPG Demonschool set to release in Q3 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're finally getting close to Demonschool actually releasing, with it now having a Q3 2025 release window so it will be here before the end of September.</p>
<p>In Demonschool you will hunt gruesome devils and bosses inspired by '60s and '70s Italian horror cinema and Japanese horror manga as 2D and 3D realms clash, washed in the fluorescent hues of JRPG giants like Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. Master a chess-like tactical board inspired by Into the Breach and form strategies to take down Hell’s deadliest creatures.</p>
<p>Latest trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QasyHgjha2I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dbdf6321f1bcb2932082b58a41e7385.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QasyHgjha2I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“After a few delays, we have finally shaped Demonschool into the game we set out to create,” said Brandon Sheffield, creative director of Necrosoft Games. “We’d like to thank our audience for supporting us through the development process and can’t wait for them to fish out every little detail the island has to offer.”</p>
<p>At release it will have Native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>

      <title>Snailshock is Pool but with Snails, with Dice for extra moves and Cards to mess with them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your weird and quirky indie games? You'll want to check out Snailshock Grand Supreme Tournament, which answers a question no one asked - what if Pool but Snails?</p>
<p>You get to play through a full campaign of various different versus battles, with you playing the classic game of Pool. Okay, not quite the classic game of Pool, since the balls are all <em>Snails</em>. The basics are basically the same though. Shoot the White cue snail ball into the others to attempt to pot your colour. If you pot your colour, the opponent's health goes down.</p>
<p>You can roll the dice to add some extra movements to either your colour or the opponent's and there's various cards you can also use to mess with individual snails, like powering up a snail ball for some extra movement, make one half the size for a few rounds, turn another into the cue ball and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pvQr9K4yKI0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac67219f19df2c8e4ab79919b000f6f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pvQr9K4yKI0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really clever weird spin on Pool. Love it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://oroshibu.itch.io/snailshock-grand-supreme" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">check it out on itch.io</a>. It has a Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>Monument Valley 1 and 2 get full controller support which should get them Steam Deck Verified soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer ustwo games just upgraded both Monument Valley: Panoramic Edition and Monument Valley 2: Panoramic Edition with full controller support which should get them bumped up to Steam Deck Verified status.</p>
<p>Both games are currently rated Steam Deck Playable, with the only issue on both had Valve note how they don't show the correct keybinds. Now they will, so I expect both to get re-tested and set as Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>They're incredibly highly rated, initially mobile games that eventually got an expanded PC release back in 2022. A third game, Monument Valley 3, is scheduled to get a PC release eventually with a Steam page live but no release date listed.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Zero Company is a Clone Wars XCOM and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a huge fan of XCOM including the classics and modern versions, and a big Star Wars fan, the recent STAR WARS Zero Company announcement has me terribly excited. Not only does it look and sound XCOM, it's also made by some of the people who were involved with it. The developer, Bit Reactor, has some of the minds behind XCOM, Civilization, Gears of War, Elder Scrolls Online, and more.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,” said Greg Foertsch, CEO and Creative Director at Bit Reactor. “It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12430030111745226678gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>“At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” said Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP, Lucasfilm Games. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rcxnRaZ6slU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b53f12176b6af6d079214995fe1244ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In Star Wars Zero Company, players will embark on a campaign of tactical operations and investigations across the galaxy. Between missions, they will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Company’s adversaries. Players will have the freedom to create and customize their own squad of recruited operators while getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>Hopefully there won't be any problems playing this with Proton. Since it's a single-player game, I also hope EA have learned some lessons from previous games not to force the EA app on it.</p>

<p>Speaking about adding direct Steam Deck support they said "We didn’t design for Deck on day one — but once we saw what this little machine could do, we knew we had to make a build for it." which includes a Native Linux version, full controller support and smooth performance. They also said "If you’re a Steam Deck player, we built this for you. This isn’t just a game that runs — it thrives. And we’re hoping your feedback helps push it toward full Verified status".</p>

      <title>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is a tank-battling destructive MOBA that will have Steam Deck support </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is an upcoming MOBA from Clay Token Game Studio, Inc. that might actually manage to pull in some players where others have failed, thanks to the vehicle combat and grand scale compared with other games.</p>
<p>Here it's 5 versus 5 but with two major differences. You control a special tank in twin-stick styled controls instead of a humanoid character, and you'll be battling through multiple lanes that have over 100 "minions" to blast through. They said it "combines traditional lane-based mechanics with a tactical warzone feel". Oh, and the map is destructible too. Buildings and walls can be destroyed to forge a new path between lanes, <em>I think this sounds awesome.</em></p>
<p>They've <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3199180/announcements/detail/498319044783374736" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> their full support for the Steam Deck noting that they're "currently in the process of intense testing and optimization to ensure the game runs smoothly on handheld devices, both technically and in terms of gameplay". They're working on getting in Steam Deck Verified, with their demo build "currently running at around 60 FPS in internal tests" which is very promising.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1k24suf/were_planning_a_native_linux_release_for_our/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they're also asking if people want a Native Linux version of it, otherwise it will run with Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kx-u_InH0SY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65d0ead0be6490c85135f6e9590895a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kx-u_InH0SY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The trailer sold me pretty quickly. I just hope their monetisation of it is fair as it seems it will be free to play. </p>

      <title>Ubuntu 25.04 upgrades halted due to Kubuntu users getting a broken desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of a major woopsie. The upgrade path for the latest Ubuntu 25.04 release has been pulled offline, as it has resulted in Kubuntu users seeing a broken desktop.</p>
<p>What you end up with is a weird looking login screen, and nothing seems to work. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19134569061744989712gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Picture credit: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dimspace.xyz/post/3ln3mizqzrc2q" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@dimspace.xyz</a> on Bluesky</em></p>
<p>I actually <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/liamd.gamingonlinux.com/post/3llgrewoaqk26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">encountered</a> this bug during the Beta, thinking I had done something wrong or not paid enough attention. Turns out, it was a real genuine <em>major</em> bug. I probably should have reported it, but I'm always doing multiple things at the same time and quite overworked right now. So, uh, feel free to blame me I guess? Developers can't fix stuff they don't know about — woops.</p>
<p>Writing on Reddit in replies to posts about the problem, Simon Quigley the Lubuntu Release Manager, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kubuntu/comments/1k1ncaf/comment/mnoo753/?context=3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's what's going on with this, because yeah, there's something going on.</p>
<p>It's my fault personally, sorry folks.</p>
<p>So, when you go to upgrade from Kubuntu 24.10 to 25.04, the actual installer is grabbed as a tarball from the archive.</p>
<p>In other words, Kubuntu 25.04's upgrader is used to upgrade to 25.04, from 24.10.</p>
<p>Well, I ported it to PyQt6 this cycle. A few weeks before release, I was pinged with someone notifying me that Kubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Lubuntu didn't actually come with pyqt6 installed.</p>
<p>Literally, installing pyqt6 should fix your issue, for now. If you run into actual issues with the Kubuntu install after upgrade, I'm much more concerned.</p>
<p>We have a fix, in the queue. Waiting. Sitting. We had the release today. I'm surprised people are able to upgrade already, and if someone already enabled the upgrades without checking with me... I'm going to be unhappy, to say the least.</p>
<p>Some cross training is happening, we're working it out. For now, this was me, sorry about that folks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then in a follow-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kubuntu/comments/1k1ncaf/comment/mnq4pox/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, just a quick update on the latest.</p>
<p>Yes, 25.04 upgrades are broken beyond just adding pyqt6 as a dependency. While I had something to do with it, there's a much greater issue at play that we don't know about yet.</p>
<p>From everything I can possibly read, enabling upgrades this early was a genuine mistake not found in code review. I have done everything in my power to slam the brakes on the upgrades, not just for Kubuntu, but for everyone. All ten flavors, plus Desktop, and Server.</p>
<p>Yes, I personally pushed the code change disabling those upgrades. It required one more manual step, and now it's deployed.</p>
<p>As of about 20 minutes ago, I've passed off to the official Ubuntu Release Team who will now drive this to completion. The change I made was to mark Plucky as unsupported temporarily, which will halt the upgrades, with a POSSIBLE side effect of an end of life popup, on your Plucky machine.</p>
<p>Ignore the popup, it was just the quickest solution to throw a wrench in the gears.</p>
<p>I'm genuinely sorry about this. On behalf of Ubuntu, on behalf of Kubuntu, and on behalf of my own flavor, Lubuntu. This is unacceptable, and I will be persistent in making sure our processes become better.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to go to sleep now. This thread is what alerted me that there's a wider issue, specifically. So, thank you all.</p>
<p>We'll be better. If you need help picking up the pieces, yes, we have support channels for basically everything. The best thing is to just make sure the kubuntu-desktop package is already installed.</p>
<p>I hope you can also understand my position. I have never worked for Canonical, I work for Altispeed Technologies. Please go support the Ask Noah Show, Noah is the one who made sure I had enough coffee to survive this thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accidents and bugs happen, hopefully some lessons will be learned from all sides on this. Just goes to show, Beta releases are vital to pick up bugs…if they're reported.</p>

      <title>Peaceful nature simulation city-builder Of life and Land launches May 16</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Of life and Land has been in Early Access for just over a year now, and it's about to cross over the finishing line as Metaroot and Kerzoven have announced the 1.0 launch for May 16th.</p>
<p>More about it: Of Life and Land is a charming settlement-building strategy game paired with a rich nature simulation experience. Every animal and plant strives to find its place in nature while you lead your villagers to their future. Expand to different regions and trade with local factions to gain needed resources.</p>
<p>The 1.0 Release introduces a brand-new historical scenario about the Counts of Lenzburg, set in the Central Plateau of medieval Switzerland. Players can build the Lenzburg Castle, discover ancient myths, and take part in a time of political conflict between church and empire. New features also include castle construction, single-city scenarios, advanced trade mechanics, and decorative elements like benches, signposts, and flower boxes to bring settlements to life.</p>

<p>There's been a lot of updates to it since the initial Early Access release including dirt and humidity simulation, more animals, a simulated education and retirement system, new buildings and much more.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

Luckily they take direction really well, so with a flick of your conductor's baton, you’ll be able to get them on beat in no time!"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plot Your Path: </strong>Carefully plot the Tempopo’s path through each puzzle, helping them work together to use items and interact with the island map to safely reach the island's end. </li>
<li><strong>A Puzzler’s Paradise:</strong> Each puzzle is an exercise in trial and error, as you experiment with different placements and routes. But don’t worry, Hana is always on hand to give a helpful hint to anyone who needs it! Bonus challenge levels add a <em><strong>huge </strong></em>chunk of extra puzzling outside the main levels for those seeking a bit more difficulty too. </li>
<li><strong>Plot Your Garden:</strong> As you puzzle across all four seasons rescuing Hana’s magical flowers, you’ll replant them back in her musical garden. </li>
<li><strong>Nature’s Orchestra:</strong> Each flower plays a note based on where they’re placed, and you can even stack multiple flowers into the same spot to create chords. As you progress, you’ll collect a whole variety of different sounds to add to the melody - horns, harps and more! Get lost in the rhythm of making new tunes, or trying to recreate your favourites! </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A word from the developer: "Creating Tempopo led to the journey of a lifetime," said Sanatana Mishra, Director of Tempopo and co-founder of Witch Beam. "We've seen everything from a young woman in Melbourne being inspired to create her own games, to an older man in Kyoto giving himself a silent yet forceful fist pump as he rescued a particularly difficult flower. I hope the finished game can surprise and delight those players in ways they couldn't imagine."</p>

      <title>DOOM (2016) gets a surprise release on GOG with a big discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DRM freedom from hell. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_2016" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DOOM (2016)</a> has just released on GOG and there's a nice big discount to go along with the release. However, it's single-player only though.</p>
<p>It's 80% off until May 2nd so this is a great chance to get it. You can play GOG games easily on Linux / Steam Deck with the likes of Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uyT4G2oYtZQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc37fb0b66e762c795c344a7e792dc3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uyT4G2oYtZQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Not that it needs any introduction, but taken from the GOG page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by id software, the studio that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and created multiplayer Deathmatch, DOOM returns as a brutally fun and challenging modern-day shooter experience. Relentless demons, impossibly destructive guns, and fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense, first-person combat.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>You’ve come here for a reason. The Union Aerospace Corporation’s massive research facility on Mars is overwhelmed by fierce and powerful demons, and only one person stands between their world and ours. As the lone DOOM Marine, you’ve been activated to do one thing – kill them all.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A Relentless Campaign</strong></p>
<p>There is no taking cover or stopping to regenerate health as you beat back Hell’s raging demon hordes. Combine your arsenal of futuristic and iconic guns, upgrades, movement and an advanced melee system to knock-down, slash, stomp, crush, and blow apart demons in creative and violent ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really is nice to see some bigger releases come to GOG. Hopefully more will come later like DOOM Eternal too.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 25.04 &#39;Plucky Puffin&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 18/04/25 16:28 BST</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ubuntu-25-04-upgrades-halted-due-to-kubuntu-users-getting-a-broken-desktop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upgrades have been halted due to a major bug</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Canonical has today released Ubuntu 25.04, codenamed "Plucky Puffin", their latest feature upgrade release to one of the most popular Linux distributions. This also includes updates for all the other editions like Kubuntu. It will be supported for 9 months until January 2026 as this is not a long term support release.</p>
<p>This release has been dedicated to Steve Langasek, who sadly passed away January 1st. As said in the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subscribers to the <em>ubuntu-{devel-}announce</em> mailing list and long term participants in the Ubuntu community will have come across Steve Langasek’s work. Steve, known in the community as vorlon, was a long-term member of the Release team (along with being a member of Archive Admin, Techboard, SRU team, and so on) and a colleague to many of us at Canonical. As a member of the Release team, Steve was responsible for devising many of the processes, policies, and tools which we use today, and teaching his fellow members the ropes. <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/remembering-and-thanking-steve-langasek/52665" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steve passed away on 1st January 2025</a> after being unwell for quite some time. The Ubuntu Release Team dedicates 25.04 “Plucky Puffin” to our colleague and friend, Steve Langasek. He is missed and will live in our hearts forever. Thank you for everything, Steve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been running Kubuntu 25.04, since I prefer KDE Plasma, since the Beta release and it has been really smooth. Overall very happy with it as my main choice for my desktop workstation and gaming PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8906297911744913818gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8906297911744913818gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 25.04</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of upgrades in this one including Linux kernel 6.14, which includes the new NTSYNC driver for Wine / Proton. Although <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">don't get too excited</a> about it increasing Windows game performance. There's also the new ARM64 Desktop Image, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/gnome-48-released-with-notification-stacking-performance-improvements-and-initial-hdr-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 48</a> and lots of assorted software upgrades. For gamers on NVIDIA GPU laptops, you'll be hopefully pleased with NVIDIA Dynamic Boost being enabled by default which should give a bit more performance. Plus there's also support for newer Intel GPUs along with Mesa 25.0.</p>
<p>Installation and upgrades should be easier too. The installer added the option to replace an existing Ubuntu install, and there's better support for dual booting with Windows with BitLocker.</p>

      <title>Grab some great stuff for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming for April 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the new up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for April 17th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered v1.2 fixes &#34;excessive jitter&#34; with Frame Generation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered has been updated with another major patch version 1.2, which brings quite a few essential fixes along with a performance improvement for players on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So far the PC release seems to have been quite well received overall. It's Steam Deck Verified, with many players reporting it does work surprisingly well. It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam. Seems like overall that Nixxes and Naughty Dog have done great with it, a pretty stark comparison to all the issues when the first came to PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1488504191744909984gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Release Notes - 1.2.10416.0553</h4>
<ul>
<li>Addressed a bug where players were unable to fire weapons on the first mouse click, after using the mouse to restart a checkpoint.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would automatically fire their weapon, when aiming after a stealth kill, if the Reload/Quick Throw/Use action was mapped to [R].</li>
<li>Enabling NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation in the launcher now increases the frame rate by the same amount as enabling it in the in-game Display menu.</li>
<li>Addressed an issue where completing a No Return Challenge would not reward the player with the associated weapon skin.</li>
<li>Refracted light in the aquarium is no longer affected by high frame rates, preventing it from being distracting and overly flashy.</li>
<li>Resolved shadow pop-in issues on the side of a building and flickering in a blood stain on the floor of a building in the Capitol Hill area.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when loading into a cutscene with a wide Field of View setting.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that could cause Direct3D Invalid Call crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused some username text on No Return leaderboards to appear as question marks.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that could cause dark lines to appear in volumetric fog during camera movement on ultrawide aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Updated AMD FidelityFx to version 1.1.3 and resolved excessive jitter on Steam Deck when FSR Frame Generation is enabled.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where pressing 'Reset to Default' in the Graphics menu would cause the preset to incorrectly appear as 'Custom'.</li>
<li>Various fixes for visual bugs in ultrawide cinematics.</li>
<li>Various stability improvements.</li>
<li>Various localization fixes.</li>
<li>Various UI bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stress-testing and hardware monitoring tool OCCT has officially released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more apps like this arrive with official Linux support! OCCT for Linux is here and out of Beta testing bringing a full stress-testing and hardware monitoring suite.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the announcement they said the Linux version can do basically everything the Windows version can:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive Stress Tests – Evaluate CPU, GPU, and memory performance under heavy workloads to ensure the stability and reliability of your system.</li>
<li>Advanced Monitoring Tools – Get real-time insights about temperature, voltage, power consumption, and other critical system metrics.</li>
<li>Multi-Platform Support – Compatible with major Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Redhat, Arch Linux, and many more.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface – A streamlined and intuitive UI accessible to all users.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only the start though, as they said they will "keep enhancing OCCT's monitoring capabilities on Linux" although it's already "fully polished". Next up their priority is to provide the "highly anticipated SSD testing feature".</p>

We hope that with the launch of the full version, more players will join our community and the number of gamers who love classic rally racing as much as we do will grow. As a team, we wish you an adrenaline-fueled, thrilling experience, and we're excited to hear from you about your impressions, so we can continue fine-tuning the game post-launch. We are also still working on console versions, which we hope to release later this year." — Dariusz Pietrala, Game Director w Pixel Perfect Dude.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Easy to learn, hard to master – a simple and intuitive driving model that beginners will handle with ease. However, challenging trials await those who know well the sound of gravel under their tires. It's a system designed to highlight the best aspects of racing games.</li>
<li>Drive your way – classic championships, free roam, or party mode allowing for up to 12 players to compete? #DRIVE Rally offers a variety of ways to enjoy the journey ahead.</li>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite Linux 42 brings Beta support for the MSI Claw handhelds and lots of other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Building on top of the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42 release</a>, Bazzite 42 is out now for this increasingly popular SteamOS-like option to put on your handhelds, desktops and more.</p>
<p>The project continues to grow quite nicely too, and they've shared another snapshot of recent statistics that show Bazzite as having around 29.5K active users as of April. Which is up from the 26.3K they showed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steamos-like-bazzite-linux-has-some-nice-growth-thanks-to-great-handheld-pc-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17636506341744881309gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17636506341744881309gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As for what's new with Bazzite 42 there's of course all the enhancements from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42</a> along with Beta support for the MSI Claw handhelds, there's improved HDR for both GNOME and KDE too along with "various improvements throughout the project". Another nice adjustment is improved HTPC support (Home Theater PC) with a patch for Steam's audio output resetting so it should now stick to what you set.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some future plans were also outlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our team is working with the folks at Fyra Labs (Ultramarine Linux) on a new Live ISO experience that may come to Bazzite in the future and a new Flatpak store is on the way to replace the aging Discover/Software thanks to Glorious Eggroll. Additionally, Yafti is being replaced with a modern and better first-run installer as soon as possible, and we’ll continue to work on expanding to new handhelds. As always if you want to come join us everything here is built in GitHub. We’d love the additional support!</p>

      <title>Moonsigil Atlas is a deckbuilding roguelike with tile-based energy that&#39;s Tetris meets Slay The Spire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this blending of ideas looks damn cool. Moonsigil Atlas looks like it really warps deckbuilders into something quite unique, and I can't wait to check this one out. The developer said it's basically Tetris meets Slay the Spire, and as far as comparisons go it's quite a fun hook to think on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2503700591744819790gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2503700591744819790gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here you play your cards by positioning special magic sigils on the big crescent moon, playing as many as you can that you have the space to fit in. The game will have multiple characters to play as, along with hundreds of cards for a whole lot of possible decks to build.</p>
<p>Depending on where you place your sigils you might get bonuses for adjacency, overlap, and more. With some persisting between turns, or with ongoing effects, and enemies to face that can cast their own hostile sigils to mess with you too. </p>
<p>I really do love the style of this one. Check out their announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590810/Moonsigil_Atlas_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam demo page</a> live for you to follow now too and the game will have Native Linux support. High up on my wishlist this goes!</p>

      <title>Horripilant is a chilling incremental dungeon crawl through the horrors of a forgotten underworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pas Game Studio recently revealed the freaky looking Horripilant. A game that combines elements of an idler, puzzle and autobattler that sees you fight, mine, and think your way through the depths of a forsaken dungeon. Probably one of the most unique looking dungeon crawlers I've ever seen.</p>
<p>It looks wild, and it's currently going through Beta testing, with a Native Linux build being put up, and the they showed it running on a Steam Deck on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/traz.bsky.social/post/3lmwtv2hhgk2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzHhzFOaIyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce75adfa576bd4c9ff55cd25f896ab2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzHhzFOaIyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Story</p>
<p>You awaken. An old, battered knight, lost in the darkest corners of an abandoned dungeon, with no memory of how you got there. The stench of decay permeates the thick air. The walls seem to whisper your name.</p>
<p>As you stir, a strange tree sprout catches your eye. You hit it, for the voice demands it of you; a twig breaks off onto the ground. With your newfound resource, you seem to be able to ameliorate your equipment. Distorted moans echo from an empty staircase. The voice calls to you again, beckoning you. You must go down. It is your purpose...</p>
<p>Encounter bizarre characters, solve cryptic puzzles, and survive the horrors that lurk in every shadow. Will you escape this living nightmare, or will it consume you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Incrementally gain and collect materials.</li>
<li>Combat horrific foes in the dungeon.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and explore the depths of your camp.</li>
<li>Upgrade your gear to venture deeper.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meet god and gain strong boons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat, adapt, and survive. The depths need you, and you need it.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 42 is out now with KDE Plasma Desktop promoted and x86 programs on ARM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big release for the Linux world is here. Fedora Linux 42 has arrived bringing with it the latest and greatest in open source software and a good choice to run on your desktops, laptops and more.</p>
<p>One of my favourite changes that came with this release is the promotion of the KDE Plasma Desktop to "Edition" status, giving it a front-row seat to show it has great support. Giving a true flagship status to my personal pick for the best desktop environment, and the same one used on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11801586791744816273gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The official Fedora website</em></p>
<p>Additionally, the enhancement of running <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/new-in-fedora-running-x86-programs-on-arm-systems/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">x86 programs on ARM systems</a> out of the box on Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop 42. Using some of the work originally developed for Fedora Asahi Remix for Apple systems.</p>
<p>You'll be getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/gnome-48-released-with-notification-stacking-performance-improvements-and-initial-hdr-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 48</a> or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/kde-plasma-6-3-is-out-now-with-big-fractional-scaling-improvements-drawing-tablet-upgrades-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KDE Plasma 6.3</a> depending on which edition you pick, each desktop release bringing with it plenty of enhancements covered here in previous articles.</p>
<p>Some other general changes they highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fedora default wallpapers are now delivered in the JXL format instead of PNG, reducing file sizes while maintaining quality.</li>
<li>More laptop cameras used in recent models will work out-of-the-box, following up on work done in Fedora Linux 41</li>
<li>System boot times should be faster, as the plymouth system component will no longer load the full graphics driver before showing the system splash screen.</li>
<li>With the Anaconda installer running as a native Wayland application, language selections now sync between the live environment and installed system.</li>
<li>Executable file placement is simpler, as anything previously in <em>/usr/sbin</em> is now merged into <em>/usr/bin.</em></li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA 575.51.02 Beta driver brings NVIDIA Smooth Motion support to Linux, GeForce RTX 5060 series announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nearly a month since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/nvidia-570-133-07-driver-released-for-linux-with-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last stable update</a>, NVIDIA have today released the 575.51.02 Beta driver that brings with it support for NVIDIA Smooth Motion on Linux along with various bug fixes. NVIDIA also formally announced the GeForce RTX 5060 series. <em>In case you missed it NVIDIA also recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/nvidia-open-sourced-physx-and-flow-gpu-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open sourced PhysX and Flow GPU code</a>.</em></p>
<p>Here's the full list of what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extended the __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC environment variable, which was available to EGL applications, to also apply to GLX and Vulkan applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Marvel Rivals to crash on startup or when loading levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the applications that use the VK_KHR_present_wait extension to hang on Wayland.</li>
<li>Added support for GLX front buffer rendering on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Minecraft to crash on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME Render Offload from working correctly when using NVIDIA GPUs as both the render offload source and the render offload sink.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented VRR from working when overriding an EDID through the /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/edid_override interface.</li>
<li>Added support for the DRM plane properties COLOR_ENCODING and COLOR_RANGE.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Default TGP and Max TGP values from being reported in the nvidia-settings control panel while running notebook systems on battery power.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to display freezes on some systems when toggling Night Mode with GNOME on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause graphics applications to not render correctly after a system suspend/resume cycle, if using the nvidia.ko kernel module parameter NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Added support for NVIDIA Smooth Motion. See the "NVIDIA Smooth Motion" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended the nvidia-powerd daemon to also support Dynamic Boost while a notebook is running on battery power. See the "Dynamic Boost on Linux" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-modeset driver to trim trailing whitespace from the product name passed to the GPU's audio device as part of the EDID-Like Data (ELD).</li>
<li>Dropped support for NV_PLANE_BLEND_CTM, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_TF, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT_SIZE, and NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_MULTIPLIER DRM plane properties on Linux kernels earlier than 6.8 to avoid exceeding DRM_OBJECT_MAX_PROPERTY.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause render-offloaded applications using KDE Frameworks 6 to crash.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/243334/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></p>
<p>For the new Smooth Motion support, NVIDIA give info on what it is and how it works on Linux in their <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/575.51.02/README/nvpresent.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">readme</a> which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.</p>
<p>The feature supports x86_64 Vulkan applications.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Smooth Motion can be enabled by setting the environment variable <code class="inline-code">NVPRESENT_ENABLE_SMOOTH_MOTION=1</code> when launching a game. This will enable the <code class="inline-code">VK_LAYER_NV_present</code> implicit Vulkan layer, which overrides the application's presentation to inject additional frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the GeForce RTX 5060 series the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti (16GB / 8GB) is out today, and the GeForce RTX 5060 (8GB) arrives in May.</p>

<p>After Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced in January</a> that a public beta of Steam Deck's SteamOS is coming for more handhelds, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial SteamOS 3.7 Preview</a> added the start of it and now the latest SteamOS 3.7.3 Preview brings more improvements for other handhelds.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">SteamOS 3.7.3 Preview "Variable Release Rate" arrived April 16 with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529844242184405003" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for frame limiting with VRR displays (internal and external).</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when no displays are connected.</li>
<li>Added support for the power button on Asus and Lenovo handhelds.</li>
<li>Improved input support for Asus and Lenovo handhelds.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is available for Steam Deck in the Preview channel (Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel).</p>
<p>Many people have been trying it on other handhelds using the SteamOS recovery image download, but it's <em>not</em> recommended yet since there's still a <em>lot</em> of work to be done but clearly Valve are making some nice steps towards that proper public release.</p>
<p>Exciting times ahead for the Linux gaming community. The public SteamOS 3 release should be quite a big boost. And hopefully we'll see more hardware vendors support it officially with you being able to eventually buy more handhelds with SteamOS 3 shipping on them like the Legion Go S.</p>

      <title>Ludaro puts a roguelike deck-building twist on the classic board game Ludo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whatever will developers turn into a deck-builder next? Ludo, apparently. The classic board game has been warped into Ludaro. Well, if Balatro can turn Poker into a roguelike, why not this classic and the trailer actually makes it look quite fun.</p>
<p>Here you collect special Spirit Cards as you go that allow you to reshape the game. You can change your dice rolls, alter the board to make new paths and stack lots of passive effects "until reality bends to your will". Ludaro sounds pretty chaotic with new rules being thrown in every so often so you need to keep changing your strategy too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FSyyM3cMs5Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a45e3f59c061b81fd351a07ef343eb84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FSyyM3cMs5Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roll the Dice, Play Your Way</strong></p>
<p>Rolling the dice isn’t just about luck—it’s about timing, planning, and taking the right risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>You always know what’s still possible—but never what comes next.</li>
<li>Play it safe, or push your luck for massive rewards.</li>
<li>Every roll is a moment of strategy—will you take control, or embrace the chaos?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stack Powers, Build Your Own Luck</strong></p>
<p>Along the way, you’ll unlock wild and unpredictable upgrades that push every run to new heights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit Cards that change the way you play.</li>
<li>Abilities that make every roll stronger, riskier, or more rewarding.</li>
<li>Creatures that reshape the board and unlock hidden opportunities.</li>
<li>Effects that combine, stack, and lead to explosive turns.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due out sometime in "Fall 2025" with Native Linux support and they said it's "optimized for Steam Deck".</p>
<p>Really looking forward to this one.</p>

      <title>The final Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 patch is out now with cross-play, photo mode, new subclasses</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's done, finished! The final Baldur's Gate 3 content update is here along with a special animated short to mark the occasion. As expected, is a rather large enhancement to the game with some very long patch notes.</p>
<p>Along with all the new content, photo mode and fixes, they've also done a tweak for the Steam Deck which has FSR 2.2 set to "Quality" by default. Hopefully this will result in a better overall experience. Exciting for players across different platforms is that you can now play together. PC, Mac, Xbox and PlayStation 5 can all do multiplayer with full cross-platform progression and cross-play using the Larian Network.</p>
<p>There's also all the new subclasses to try out, one for each class including: Path of the Giant Barbarian, College of Glamour Bard, Death Domain Cleric, Circle of Stars Druid, Arcane Archer Fighter, Way of the Drunken Master Monk, Oath of the Crown Paladin, Swarmkeeper Ranger, Swashbuckler Rogue, Shadow Magic Sorcerer, Hexblade Warlock, and Bladesinging Wizard</p>
<p>Check out the new animated short for the final patch:</p>

      <title>D.O.T. Defence is a fast-paced gamepad-friendly RTS now on Steam with co-op and versus modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Real time chaotic strategy simplified to make it work well on a gamepad? With single-player, versus and co-op modes? D.O.T. Defence is out in Early Access with Native Linux support made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to D.O.T. Defence, a simplified yet deeply strategic RTS experience that seamlessly blends accessibility with tactical depth. We offer a simplified economy system, massive automated battles with light command, and a fun simplified upgrade system. Play in short bursts as matches last between 5-10 minutes! The only objective is to protect your HQ and destroy the enemies! Crafted by developers passionate about the genre, this game delivers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of their childhoods."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6-4gR71xGh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/352956c5a895f184aa3cbd153547ad82.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6-4gR71xGh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's available during Early Access (from the developer):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight with Friends and Bots</strong>: Jump into local multiplayer mayhem with 1v1, 2v2, and chaotic free-for-all battles against your buddies or cunning AI.</li>
<li><strong>Dominate the Battlefield</strong>: Capture and hold key strategic locations to build vital facilities and keep supply lines flowing. Control the economy, bolster your troops, and pave the way to victory!</li>
<li><strong>Simple Controls, Deep Strategy</strong>: Don't let the gamepad focus fool you – there's plenty of strategic depth here. Issue broad commands or fine-tune unit paths, you can even let your units autonomously secure crucial points. It's the perfect blend of accessible fun and engaging tactics.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Updates Incoming!</strong>: We're committed to making D.O.T. Defence the best it can be. Expect frequent updates throughout Early Access with fresh content, exciting new features and improvements driven by YOUR FEEDBACK!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said it will be in Early Access for at least 5-8 months as they plan quite a lot more content to come including a campaign for all three factions, new game modes, more gameplay modifiers, more maps and so on.</p>
<p>I picked up a personal copy and so far I actually <em>really</em> like the idea of it. Being able to buddy up with someone, each with a gamepad in hand while trying to destroy each-other can be good fun. Although, some versus matches feel a little bit like they drag on a little due to how simplified it is, with you only equipping 4 possible structures each. That feeling gets better as you play more and unlock other possibilities, so each player can do something a little different. But still, not a lot of room for different strategies in the versus mode.</p>
<p>Playing co-op though is quite different in the waves-based mode, as working together you each get your own gold income to build up defences so it's a lot of fun chatting away as you decide on your little plan of action.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19329940051744724316gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19329940051744724316gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15359769861744724319gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15359769861744724319gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm really keen to see how they expand it during Early Access but what's there right now is a great start. Their idea of adding in a more long-term 4x-like "Global Domination" mode sounds interesting.</p>

      <title>I can&#39;t wait to send people flying in Aquapark Tycoon - new trailer out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aquapark Tycoon from Boxelware, who previously made the space sim Avorion, is an upcoming water theme park building game and a new trailer is out now. It's still in development with a release planned sometime this year, and it will have Native Linux support like their previous game.</p>
<p>The game was originally unveiled live at the gaming event Caggtus in Leipzig, Germany back in April last year. Boxelware was once again on board this year, presenting the new trailer. The development team continues to work on new features, and have been posting developer blogs on Steam going over what features they've been adding into the game including a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2819470/view/499443042471641204" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">whole bunch</a> of Saunas.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the new trailer below:</p>

<p>I'm excited for this one, are you? Especially since it will have online co-op too.</p>

      <title>A public alpha of the &#39;semi-immutable&#39; Manjaro Summit Linux is now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The future of Linux distributions in many ways seems like immutable may be a good path, and now the Manjaro team want you to test out their own version of it with Manjaro Summit. Originally called Manjaro Immutable, it's now Manjaro Summit and a public Alpha release has now been made available.</p>
<p>More about it as explained by a developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manjaro Summit is a semi-immutable distro with an atomic update system. Updates are done by downloading pre-made disk images, the root partition is read-only and only parts of the filesystem are migrated upon update.</p>
<p>The benefit of such a system is that everyone is running a near identical system configuration, this makes it easier to reproduce bugs and issues. Images can also be tested before being published. And should an update prove to be bad, you can simply roll back to an older unaffected version.</p>
<p>The immutability makes the system more resistant to user and software error, it also provides some limited protection against malware.</p>
<p>We are still unsure what Summit will eventually become, a stable rolling workstation distro, or an always moving distro chasing the latest and greatest in software.</p>
<p>The technology powering summit is purpose build to be as simple as possible, it is encouraged for people to start building and sharing images and configurations which fit their usecase or that of a wider community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's still quite a lot missing and to be done on it, since it's a public Alpha testing release.</p>

      <title>Save the world from insidious and cruel demons in Bosorka with a Linux version available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bosorka is an action roguelike where a young witch saves the world from insidious and cruel demons. To celebrate the first anniversary, the developer has released a Native Linux version. Developed by Sengi Games, who also made The Serpent Rogue, this update was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2118370/announcements/detail/814696363551884843" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> Monday April 14th on Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: "Bosorka is an exciting action game that combines the best elements of the roguelike and shoot'em up genres with incredibly stylized top-down 3D visualization. Immerse yourself in this dark fantasy world and show the demons who's the power to be reckoned with."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VeMp9DadP-Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97175f666dd92a610ff832d9eb9c5e1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VeMp9DadP-Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Exciting journeys to various locations - Several huge levels are generated from manually created parts. Each level is an independent biome with its own unique atmosphere, mysteries and dangerous creatures. Secret rooms, hidden passages, breathtaking landscapes, and lots of valuable things that can be encountered in unexpected places provide a real incentive to explore the environment.</li>
<li>Bosses from the netherworld - At the end of each level, you will meet powerful monsters that guard the passages to the next locations, preventing you from following the book. Each monster has an exceptional set of uncanny abilities and is capable of incinerating you in an instant, so one should be well prepared for this encounter.</li>
<li>Companion Demons - In the midst of a circle of evil demons, there may be renegades who have not been affected by evil spells and have no bad intentions. Lovely creatures, surprisingly loyal to those who save them. Raise an entire army of companions who will help you in the fight against the enemy. Some of them have marvelous abilities that will definitely come in handy.</li>
<li>Caution! Dangerous Spells - Destroy enemy hordes of evil creatures by means of powerful spells. Burn, freeze, strike with incredible lightning bolts, or pelt everyone with slimy frogs — there're various spells to suit every taste. Mysterious mirrors hidden in different corners of these regions will reveal to you new spells to defend this world from. Find them and develop the tactics to wipe out the evil.</li>
<li>Amazing combinations of collected items - Strong health, protective shell, poisonous touch or a deadly whirlwind around you, and perhaps even more. Make your own unique collection of runes. Each rune performs only one function, but the combination of several of them can significantly change the entire gameplay, turning you into a real natural calamity. And now, who is hunting who?</li>
<li>Exciting flight on a broomstick - An enchanted witch's broom is not only a means of transportation. Each broom has its own specialty and is capable of a great deal more than just flying. Unblock all the brooms, master their special skills, and you will surely find your favorite to lead you to victory.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more developers are still doing direct Native Linux support. It's currently rated Steam Deck Verified, although it's an older rating that was using Proton 8.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) announced that both MySims and MySims Kingdom have been upgraded with "some things we have been working on for a long time" which includes Steam Deck support for both titles. They were originally released for the Nintendo DS and Wii back in 2007, and had re-releases on Steam back in march 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15963981381744711693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck compatibility for both titles, allowing you to play on the go!
	<ul>
<li>Tip: The trackpad will function as a mouse, while the joystick and buttons will act as an Xbox controller. You can't use both at once, so, if you nudge the trackpad any joystick or button input will allow the controller to regain functionality. If you want to change controllers while playing on the steam deck, you will need to configure that within the deck itself to recognize a new primary controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In MySims, added the ability to move Sims into the Garden area, opening up room for 8 new residents</li>
<li>In both MySims and MySims: Kingdom, added 4 more skin tones for players to choose from, allowing for increased customization of your Sim.</li>
<li>Steam Trading Cards are now available!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Fixed Bugs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A lantern option, currently only available for Goth Boy and Madame Zoe, is now available for all buildings once unlocked in MySims</li>
<li>Multiple songs now loop in Workshop and remodel modes in MySims</li>
<li>Resolved a softlock if you invite a commercial Sim to move in, but then change your mind to invite another; leading to no one being able to move in</li>
<li>Hand and arm skin tones match the face on all outfits now in both games</li>
<li>Buddy and Lyndsay’s icons appear during Island transitions in Kingdom</li>
<li>Fixed flickering visual glitch on Trevor’s Island in Kingdom</li>
<li>Thanks to your feedback, we have been made aware of some discrepancies in the lighting and cutscenes. Adjustments have been made to Kingdom to ensure a more consistent experience in some of our characters from the original MySims game.</li>
<li>Changes made in the Garden now persist after leaving / saving</li>
<li>Various memory and performance improvements to resolve crashes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really loving seeing more classic games get a fresh life on PC. And if they work well on Steam Deck, they'll work on Desktop Linux too thanks to Valve's Proton. </p>

<p>Writing about why the features took so long in the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3328910/view/592894082264597444" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned the age of the games and the custom systems involved, and hilariously how they "break if you look at them the wrong way". With a small team working on the ports they wanted to take time to get them perfected.</p>
<p>Seems like Valve will need to put both through verification, since currently MySims is "Unsupported" and MySims Kingdom is unrated currently. Perhaps they can both be bumped up to Steam Deck Verified now.</p>

      <title>First person puzzle-adventure metroidvania Memory&#39;s Reach looks great with Steam Deck support announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Memory's Reach is a very promising looking first-person puzzle-adventure metroidvania, and the good news is that it will have Steam Deck support at launch.</p>
<p>More about it: "Explore a Long Lost Alien Planet - Armed with nothing more than old star charts, dubious rumors, and your trusty spaceship, travel to the long-lost planet Virishal. Explore a world of towering megastructures and overgrown ruins - a civilization wiped clean in a great cataclysm, its monuments now reclaimed by steaming jungles, buried in crumbling mineshafts, and falling to ruin in slowly decaying orbits. Somewhere on this world is hidden the ancient treasure of the Mairi, sealed away eons ago to protect it from the great cataclysm. Explore Virishal and locate the treasure - but beware what other perilous secrets lie sleeping below the planet's surface!"</p>
<p>Their latest trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bsViVj6gnMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6999dddebf2df812cb94296609badef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bsViVj6gnMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2126810/announcements/detail/669455275569185504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Steam Deck Support</h4>
Steam Deck is now officially supported with customized default settings and a larger UI.<br/>
<br/>
The first time you run the game on Steam Deck it will apply custom default settings optimized for 40fps, but you can of course tweak the settings yourself, which brings me to...<br/>
<h4>New Settings in the New Settings Menu</h4>
The settings UI has been overhauled. It's cleaner, less buggy, and now only takes up half the screen so you can see the effects of your changes in real time.<br/>
Many settings options have been tweaked, added, or removed as development has progressed, but a few highlights in this update include:
<ul>
<li>Added support for FSR and DLSS upscaling. Either of these upscalers can be used to significantly boost performance. FSR is available on Windows, Mac, and Steam Deck. DLSS is available on Windows PCs with a compatible NVIDIA GPU.</li>
<li>Added UI scaling option. On Steam Deck this will default to the maximum value. I also recommend adjusting this if you're playing on a TV or large monitor. Just note that the UI is still a work in progress (most of it still uses placeholder art) so some of the scaling can be a little inconsistent and not all elements will always scale evenly. This will improve as development continues and the final UI art begins to be implemented.</li>
<li>Added additional graphics settings for performance optimization and accessibility.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they have it working on Steam Deck, it will also work on Desktop Linux thanks to Valve's Proton. And, this means hopefully good performance if they're doing proper testing to announce support.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer CSR-Studios are currently working on Dead Pixels II but they decided to give the original Dead Pixels from 2012 a surprise upgrade. This comes with Native Linux support and they're hoping to see it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about the game: "A toxic waste spill finds its way into the water supply, causing the recently deceased to rise from their graves. Now it's up to you to blast your way through the hordes of undead if you're going to escape the city. On the way to your rescue, you'll search stores and houses for supplies, and trade with other survivors. With three game modes, hundreds of items, weapons and grenades, and a city that is never the same twice, there is always something new hiding round the corner in Dead Pixels. When the Dead Start Walking, It's Time to Run."</p>
<p>It features over 100 weapons, a different procedurally generated city each time you play, multiple game modes, multiple difficulty modes, solo and local co-op, online leaderboards and more.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft open sourced Chroma, their colourblind simulation tool</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wonderful to see! Ubisoft announced yesterday that they've open sourced their colourblind simulation tool Chroma (UbiChroma as it's called on GitHub), after several years of internal use and development.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said "With an estimated 300 million people around the world affected by colorblindness, Chroma allows developers to accurately replicate their experience and create accessible content to meet their needs. The open-source tool works by applying a filter over the game screen without hindering performance".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5753043281744710026gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5753043281744710026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Over the past few years, Chroma has proven to be a highly efficient tool for us at Ubisoft," says David Tisserand, Director of Accessibility. "It has allowed us to assess the accessibility of our games for colorblind players much faster and more comprehensively than ever before. Because we believe accessibility is a journey, not a race, we're thrilled to share Chroma with the entire industry. We invite everyone to benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development."</p>
<p>"Chroma was created with a clear purpose---making color blindness accessibility a natural part of the creative and testing process," says Jawad Shakil, QC Product Manager. "The team faced and overcame significant challenges while building it, but through close collaboration with accessibility experts and by refining the tool based on feedback, they created a solution that eliminated lag and inaccuracies, making accessibility testing efficient and smooth. Chroma is a testament to the team's innovation and dedication; their work is already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind. Open-sourcing Chroma is a proud step forward, allowing everyone to benefit from this innovation."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Key features (from GitHub):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Color Simulation on single monitor. This solution works on top of game and can be maximized as per requirement.</li>
<li>Work on all games. No dependency on any specific game or engine.</li>
<li>High performance. Able to simulation live gameplay upto 60 FPS.</li>
<li>Accurate results.</li>
<li>Simulation of all type of color blind forms.</li>
<li>Only available solution which capture screen live gameplay screen and simulate.</li>
<li>Easy screenshot to log error.</li>
<li>Easy and configurable UI.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Merging a western with eldritch horror, Blood West is awesome and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the latest update out today, Blood West from Hyperstrange and New Blood Interactive is now Steam Deck Verified and well worth a look. Blending together a western and eldritch horror, it's been on my watchlist for a while now because it just looks so damn good.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1587130/announcements/detail/837214361691882655?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it on Steam for the Blood West v4.3.0 update that features a new codex system to keep track of all your notes, new music additions, new achievements and they even teased that a New Game+ mode is coming. Valve checked it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> so it's good to go on Desktop Linux too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mlX_2ch4K1c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27d72369314633086530c4da60daa080.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mlX_2ch4K1c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some more of what the update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Bug fixes:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Chapter 1 boss would become unresponsive if the player performed save &amp; load at the start of the boss fight</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Rotten Skeleton’s incorrect behavior if his soul was sold and the player simply rested in a bed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where combination of Watch and Tentacle Cyst artifacts as well as maxed out Strong Lungs trait would allow player to “skip” from place to place</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Doctor in Chapter 3 would not give his sidequest</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Alvaro’s Rib where it would grant different boost values than expected when combined with certain artifacts, perks or consumables</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Hangman’s Noose kill streak would be interrupted with a headshot when using any shotgun</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where player was able to heal themselves with the Cursed Doll weapon by using its secondary attack on dead enemies’ heads (lol)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it was impossible to remove certain weapons that required “death or Purple revival” even after dying if player died while holding a different weapon in hand</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would take twice as mumch damage when landing on ladders or rope</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where regular Cultists in Dead Man’s Promise would give a lot more Soul Essence than they should</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where status effect icons would remain on screen when loaded into a new map and a dialogue was instantly triggered</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Hellfire Cultist's would have a second heart as a loot even after his heart was already stolen using pickpocketing</li>
<li>Lots of controller related issues have been fixed</li>
<li>Few language improvements have been added as well</li>
</ul>
<strong><u>Improvements:</u></strong>
<ul>
<li>Font size has been scaled up - this change is both for PC and Steam Deck and should make everything much easier to read. This also means Blood West is officially Steam Deck verified!</li>
<li>Added “drop item” functionality for controllers - default bind can be changed in the Settings menu</li>
<li>Added an option to change default metric units from meters to <strong>paces</strong>. <em>For immersions sake :)</em></li>
<li>Added a launch parameter “-nogamepad” on Steam - when used, it disables any non-keyboard/mouse inputs that could in specific cases cause issues. To enable it, just enter the command in the Launch Options in Blood West’s properties on Steam.</li>
<li>Chapter 2 boss is now slightly tougher and a bit more aggressive (rawr)</li>
<li>Lady Anabelle or The Priest will offer discounts to their wares if given the cure (mind you, this will only affect games where the player didn’t give the Cure to any of those characters yet)</li>
<li>Purple Revival now removes Blessings as well</li>
<li>Resolution in the Settings menu is now a proper dropdown list</li>
<li>Improvements to the input system to better handle certain cases like when player uses AZERTY keyboard layout and changes certain keybinds</li>
<li>Totem of Souls voice is now more “spectral” (at Gianni's request)</li>
<li>Improvements to the quest tracking and journal entries for a few Chapter 2 quests</li>
<li>A slew of small SFX improvements</li>
</ul>

      <title>4A Games are giving away Metro 2033 Redux free for 48 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quick tip - if you've never had the chance to experience the Metro series, now you can without paying a penny as 4A Games are giving away Metro 2033 Redux. They're celebrating 15 years of the game (going by the date of the original version).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hl7wY1yILsM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d115fa7b10f96250f1b4e35f0c5960a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hl7wY1yILsM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the Earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age.</p>
<p>The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.</p>
<p>Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind. But what if the real threat comes from within?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The giveaway ends April 16 at 5PM CET | 9AM PT | 4PM BST. You can grab it on PC via Steam and GOG. The game is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and it has a Native Linux version (but generally works better via Proton as it's an old port).</p>

      <title>GNOMES is my new favourite tower defense game that blends in roguelike mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you don't hear from me much over this week (or for the rest of this month), it's because I'm dedicating my time to playing GNOMES. A new tower defense roguelike hybrid from developer DYSTOPIAN with ever-expanding biomes to battle through. <em>DIsclosure: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>The feeling I got from it instant reminded me of the unholy addiction I had to the also excellent Loop Hero. Thanks to the clean retro style and the brilliant way it really hooks you in. GNOMES definitely looks simple on the surface but it's surprisingly deep.</p>
<p>Here to start a run you pick a guild which changes up what buildings and "towers" (GNOMES) you can build, pick a biome that changes what enemies and hazards you'll face and then attempt to progress for as long as possible. The biome level you pick will just keep on expanding with every new wave, with enemy spawn positions also constantly changing around. Thankfully, there's lots of objects you can buy and put down to change enemy wave paths, and your GNOMES can be moved around too each wave as you'll attempt to keep them away from your home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12770944291744638170gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12770944291744638170gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since the map keeps on expanding, you have a lot of room to grow during a run. This is necessary with the enemy wave paths changing each time, along with all the different types of enemies you'll be facing. It really does get quite challenging in the later waves.</p>
<p>After each wave is done you get access to the shop. Here you'll be spending up all your gold to buy up different crops and other assorted objects, which help you to earn gold to then purchase more upgrades, special relics, crops, new GNOMES to defend with and more. Part of the challenge here is that you can only stack up a limited amount of different items to build, so spending your coins wisely and attempting to plan ahead is how it gets you.</p>
<p>The crop system is a big part of the fun here. There's an assortment of different crops that all do different things like spreading fertile soil to let you place more, each give different gold amounts, some have a special adjacency bonus, some might buff up nearby GNOMES power and more. Some crops will even just <em>continually</em> spread across the map until it's full, especially useful if they deal damage when enemies trample over them. Although some crops can end up a double-edge sword, as they'll block your GNOME positioning too.</p>
<p>The result is that you can make some really powerful combinations, and the game really is different each run depending on what you pick. </p>
<p>Over email the developer told me "We're just two dudes taking on the corpo giants with a $0 budget, no publisher or game engine" and it seems they've struck some gold here. After releasing on April 4th, they've already managed to hit over 11,000 sales on Steam.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Based Tower Defense</strong> - On your turn, you can move your gnomes as often as you like. Use different combinations of relics and plant abilities to help them survive the night.</li>
<li><strong>Relics, Crops and Upgrades</strong> - Each plant, relic, tool and building creates a different possible synergies. Manipulate your environment an and exploit the resources the map provides you. Grow your economy quickly, but don’t forget to defend it.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse Procedurally-Generated Biomes</strong> - Distinct biomes with procedurally generated environment, map specific enemies, different hazards and resources. Every run is different.</li>
<li><strong>Guilds with Unique Starts</strong> - Each guild stars a different type of gnome accompanied by their own starting economy and a game changing relic. Every guild has different strengths and weaknesses. Some will struggle where others thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Mode</strong> - Test your strategy against randomized waves of enemies that become exponentially more difficult every night. After you defeat the goblin king for the first time, you're given the option to continue your run until the goblins overwhelm you. How many nights can you survive?</li>
</ul>

      <title>V Rising 1.1 - Invaders of Oakveil will bring lots of new content and official Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>V Rising 1.1 - Invaders of Oakveil is set to release on April 28th and it's going to bring much improved and official support for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Along with a whole lot of new content and improvements across the whole game, their official update page when you scroll down a fair bit under the Additional Features heading states:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>STEAM DECK COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<p>Take your Vampire conquest anywhere! V Rising is now officially supported on Steam Deck, with optimized controls and performance for seamless handheld gameplay. Rise, hunt, and rule, on the go!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably then, this will get it bumped up from Steam Deck Playable to Steam Deck Verified. They don't go into much detail on what's changed for the Steam Deck, which hopefully they will in some proper update notes when it arrives. If this does bring some decent controller improvements, it will be overall better for all players on Desktop too.</p>

      <title>RNG JAM is an upcoming NBA Jam inspired arcade-styled basketball game with roguelite chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an interface that looks rather inspired by Balatro in many parts, RNG JAM from bryanthaboi will bring arcade styled basketball with roguelite chaos. <em>The game will have Native Linux support.</em></p>
<p>More about it from the developer: "Are you tired of predictable (and let’s be honest, predatory) sports games?<br/>
RNG JAM smashes together the energy of arcade basketball with the relentless replayability of a roguelite — then sprinkles in some high-stakes sports betting (purely fictional) for flavor. It’s 2-on-2 hoops meets calculated chaos. Every match is a fresh gamble, every run a wild ride."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vChJbw-Wz9U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4dd5d00cbe0e06584b4f704578b14b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vChJbw-Wz9U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2-on-2 Arcade Basketball - Fast-paced retro-style basketball inspired by NBA Jam.</li>
<li>Roguelite Chaos - Each run starts with a new team, new challenges, and new risk.</li>
<li>High-Stakes Betting - Place bets between quarters and turn risk into reward.</li>
<li>Powerups &amp; Upgrades - Boost your team's stats with in-game currency between matches.</li>
<li>Dynamic Difficulty - CPU teams get sweatier the better you do. Stay sharp.</li>
<li>No Microtransactions - All gameplay content is earned. No in-game purchases, ever.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer has been regularly posting update videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bryanthaboi/videos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (and now their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BOISCLUBGAMES/videos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">newer channel</a>).</p>
<p>One to watch for sure! I look forward to juicing up my team is some ridiculous ways.</p>

No play-through is the same the developer said as you "travel through the procedurally generated galaxy, complete assigned missions on alien planets, encounter eccentric events, trade with opportunistic shopkeepers and parasitic life forms".</p>

<p>Spin Rhythm XD is a homage to classic arcade rhythm games (Guitar Hero, DDR), with a modern aesthetic and soundtrack. Earlier in April they also put up an official Native Linux version with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1058830/view/517458075240628314" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update 1.5</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck / Linux + Switch version upgrade</p>

- Deck now supports proper multi-touch<br/>
- Visual touch panels now appear over gameplay and can be customised in the options menu<br/>
- MIDI DJ gear is now available on Steam Deck (and Linux)! Get your decks out, people!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spin Rhythm XD is big on customisation, with an included level editor and a suite of accessibility features, unlockable wheel skins and more. Fight your way to the top of the global leaderboards to become the best in the rhythm dimension. Check out the original 1.0 trailer below to see more, it looks like good fun:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_VZbB9OYr5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59604343f2d9a0839d2016dc2ffdf40f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_VZbB9OYr5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>TAKE CONTROL.</strong> Spin, flick and tap to match colours and beats. Spin Rhythm's smooth controls work seamlessly across multiple devices including mouse and keyboard, gamepads and even real MIDI DJ turntables (touch-sensitive jogs recommended).</li>
<li><strong>MASTER.</strong> Precise, hand-made levels across 5 difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert and the brutal XD difficulty).</li>
<li><strong>MUSIC.</strong> 60 licensed tracks of the juiciest beats in the known universe from Nitro Fun, Au5, Moe Shop, Hyper Potions, Camellia, Anamanaguchi, Panda Eyes, Teminite, Anomalie, Tut Tut Child, Pegboard Nerds, Tristam, Maxo, Tokyo Machine, Rogue, 2Mello and more.</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOMISE.</strong> Beat your high scores and level up to unlock wheel skins, UI skins and more.</li>

      <title>The latest Marvel Rivals update is causing problems on Linux - here&#39;s a quick workaround</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel Rivals has been updated with Season 2 by NetEase Games which brings in a new experimental shader compiler mode and other new content. However, it's causing problems for Desktop Linux players where nothing appears after hitting play.</p>
<p>Tested across Proton 9.0-4, Proton Experimental and GE-Proton 9-27 nothing appears. For now, you can work around it. What you need to do is tell the game you're running a Steam Deck. Go into the game Properties in Steam and put this in the launch options box:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Ensure you spell it correctly with the capitals "SteamDeck". You <em>won't</em> get the launcher, as this skips it, but at least for now on Desktop Linux you'll still be able to play.</p>
<p>I've added my own Proton log file to the Valve Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8300" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a> for it. Hopefully Valve will be able to track down the problem and fix it in Proton. There's a post on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/800059664763040983/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam forum</a> talking about the problem too.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor gets a release date and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a whole lot of space dwarf action going on lately. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor now has a release date for the 1.0 release and we have new footage on the upcoming Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core too.</p>
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, the bullet heaven survivor-like thingy spin-off, will be releasing the 1.0 update on September 17th, 2025. It will come with a new major feature teased with "Gear", although they're not giving much info just yet they said it's "not just a minor tweak" but a " brand-new system that will shake up the meta layer" and teased more to come.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EDnQNFn6vIk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fcbb04e80e56f593ba628525fc07ea9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EDnQNFn6vIk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>Additionally, we also have new footage for the upcoming rogue-lite action spin-off of Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. This takes the basics of the original Deep Rock Galactic that you know and love, but mixes it up into a 1-4 player co-op experience that's different each time and build up a new character as you go through each play-through.</p>
<p>They're going to start closed alpha testing for this one sometime soon.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eq303OLkBkY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/702c4069251a5476e22850cfa8f4b792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eq303OLkBkY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm thoroughly excited for Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. This is going to be a good one.</p>

      <title>Smash-hit drug sim Schedule I plans full Steam Deck support, will use the Steam Deck as the &#34;performance benchmark&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Schedule I is high up on my wishlist to eventually play-through, thankfully being in Early Access I've got plenty of time to get to it and it's only going to get better with full Steam Deck support planned.</p>
<p>What is Schedule I? It's an expansive drug-dealing sim that has seen an explosion in popularity on Steam. Released into Early Access on March 24th, sees hundreds of thousands of players on it each day.</p>
<p>Buried at the bottom of the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/503947989263319048" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm also looking into improving optimization. I'd like to get Steam Deck officially supported as soon as possible, so that'll act as my performance benchmark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great way to do it. The Steam Deck has set hardware, so using it as your device to optimise against will bring benefits for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dUxiQ1qN0rg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c24ab0fd5bcef71cc91bd53e1389284.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manufacture - Produce a range of drugs to satisfy your customers, each one with it's own unique production process. Discover special recipes to create new drug variants with special properties.</li>
<li>Distribute - Walk, skate or drive throughout the grungy west-coast city of Hyland Point to get product into the hands of customers. Hire dealers to handle distribution for you.</li>
<li>Expand - Purchase new properties and hire employees to expand the scope and scale of your operations. Work with suppliers to build a fully automated production and distribution chain.</li>
<li>Fight - This is a dangerous line of work - you'll have to contend with increasing law enforcement, as well as deadly cartel competitors. Fight with fists, melee weapons or firearms.</li>
<li>Work Together - A growing empire needs skilled management. Reach new heights in co-op multiplayer.</li>

<p>It's been so popular that the publisher of Drug Dealer Simulator 1 &amp; 2, Movie Games S.A., had to release a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1708850/view/535472473750111401" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> after various news reports of a lawsuit against Schedule I continued to spread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Gamers,<br/>
<br/>
We’d like to address your Schedule I / Drug Dealer Simulator publication and share some facts regarding the situation.<br/>
<br/>
1. <strong>There is no lawsuit.</strong><br/>
2. It is not our intention to prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game.<br/>
3. There is an investigation into the nature of similarities between the games since a preliminary legal analysis indicated there might have been an infringement.<br/>
4. The analysis and investigation were necessary in the light of repeating opinions that the games are very similar. By not investigating it, Movie Games, being a publicly traded company, could face severe consequences for negligence.<br/>
5. The above was communicated only via ESPI, a stock market communication system, where we are obligated to publish such information for full transparency. Not publishing it would also be a case of negligence. From there it was picked up by the media and, in some cases, wrongly reported as a lawsuit.<br/>
6. The above is handled only by Movie Games, the publisher, not Byterunners, the developer of Drug Dealer Simulator. The developer is not involved in it whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
There is no ill will towards TVGS. We even mailed them best wishes shortly before the release, when the game was already huge, but before the investigation was deemed necessary. However, we are obligated to perform this investigation, act accordingly to the scope of the infringement if it is confirmed, and inform the public about it via ESPI.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Movie Games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of all the reports both Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and 2 went down into Overwhelmingly Negative recent user reviews on Steam.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for April 11th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on.

      <title>Comedy narrative-driven isometric adventure Paradigm Island in need of Linux testers</title>

      <title>Vampire Survivors free Square Enix SaGa cross-over DLC, another free update and cross-save out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors just had two entirely free content drops! The first is a free DLC cross-over with Square Enix's SaGa series, along with a chicken-themed free update.</p>
<p>The free DLC, Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama, brings with it 12 new playable characters. There's also over 16 new weapons and a new Glimmer game mechanic. As the devs explained: "40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the SaGa series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there's a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of SaGa gets represented!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vrb7lTnklrw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d8267bf4f42e5c5d6d2f7a36012f8a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vrb7lTnklrw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for why it's free? Paperwork and legal issues. As they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paperwork. It took a very long time to sort out the paperwork for this collab, and it would have been twice as hard to get the licence if there had been any money exchange involved. That's simply how it works for big companies; even when the creatives on both sides just want to do it, like it has been the case for this and all other Collabs, there are a lot of hoops to go through because IP is serious business and a lot of different departments have to get involved when talking about money.<br/>
So we just did it the easy way, and in a way everyone wins: I got to have fun with SaGa, SaGa gets some more visibility, you get free content :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cross-save across PC, Xbox, Android and iOS is also live now. You might notice that PlayStation is missing and they explained that they've "run into a legal issue on PlayStation we weren't aware of that requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to".</p>
<p>As for the other free update, The Coop, that's also out now that brings in:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Egosoft reveal the big free Diplomacy update for X4: Foundations due out in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Egosoft have revealed that their expansive space sim X4: Foundations is getting another major upgrade named Diplomacy, scheduled to arrive some time this year.</p>
<p>This follows on from another major update earlier this year, which overhauled the flight model to bring improvements to how ships handle depending on their size, weight and engine configuration.</p>
<p>Diplomacy is going to be a free update for the base game, so no DLC required for it. They said it will "introduce new strategic elements, allowing players to engage in diplomacy like never before". As for what you'll get it brings the Embassy, a new facility where Diplomats can be brought together to represent their various factions. Plus you'll get access to Agents, who can be deployed on independent assignments to achieve diplomatic objectives within the X universe. Egosoft said these new tools will allow you to "influence alliances and rivalries alike, shaping the political and economic balance of the galaxy".</p>
