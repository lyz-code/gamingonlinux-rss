      <title>Deceive Inc. quickly became a favourite multiplayer game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deceive Inc. from Sweet Bandits Studios and Tripwire Presents released back in March and it recently became Steam Deck Verified. After playing quite a few hours, it quickly became a favourite on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. <u>Note</u>: Gamesight provided my key.</p>
<p>It's a first-person multiplayer game where you (or you and friends) play against others in a game of deception. Each team is attempting to unlock a vault to steal what's inside and successfully exit the map to win. The problem is — you're all in <em>disguise</em> and you can change your disguise constantly based on any of the NPCs running around the map.</p>
<p>On Linux and Steam Deck it works <em>great</em> with Proton out of the box. I did have a brief moment where it suddenly wouldn't work on desktop but another Proton Experimental update solved that. Additionally, the Steam Overlay seems to not work with it on desktop for me. It has Easy Anti-Cheat but the developers <em>have</em> enabled it for Linux and on Steam Deck it's rated Deck Verified with Proton 8.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5857764521690987102gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5857764521690987102gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - cover blown, another player found me.</em></p>
<p>Imagine if Among Us was a first-person shooter with a tiny bit of HITMAN vibes wrapped up in a very colourful and inviting style, and that <em>might</em> give you a slight idea of what to expect. I was really impressed at just how fun it is, which is surprising that on Steam it doesn't have a big player-base but it <em>does</em> also have full cross-platform multiplayer with consoles too and there's never been trouble finding a game.</p>
<p>You run around gathering intel data from various little devices spread across the map which allow you to unlock doors into buildings and unlock mini safes for character buffs. You can swap your disguise between civilians, guards, waiters, special guards, technicians and a VIP. You'll <em>need</em> to change up the disguise too, as certain people are only allowed in specific areas and if you have the wrong disguise on they will start firing at you. If you fire a weapon, your disguise will disappear as well until you wait a bit for it to come back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18546066831690987068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18546066831690987068gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - gathering intel to open some doors.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11872290351690986789gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11872290351690986789gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - about to grab a disguise.</em></p>
<p>The thing is you won't know if someone is an NPC or a player unless you really watch everyone closely to see what they're doing to catch them out (or if they're clearly not an NPC jumping across rooftops). When you're disguised, other players won't see your head move or or what direction you're looking, so you could be gathering intel or opening a door while facing another way - it has some clever design to it. NPCs will also do random actions, so you never really know who is who.</p>
<p>It's all about studying your surroundings, and trying to quickly grab enough intel to unlock the vault and potentially escape — which is easier said than done. Once you manage to steal the special item on the map, it will periodically ping your location giving other players an idea of where you are and no doubt people will try camping the exit.</p>
<p>Video of it on Steam Deck with some words from me:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nDaw6GJx_p8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac37f70c6f06d84d83477593ed7eee46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nDaw6GJx_p8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The gunplay in it doesn't feel anywhere near as good as some bigger games, you can definitely tell it's by a smaller studio but still good enough to be fun. Frantic in the team games where you're discovered by an enemy, but there's another enemy team that was also in the same area and — so much panic. Especially entertaining with all the different characters, each with their own abilities and weapons along with per-character progression.</p>
<p>Performance is absolutely not an issue on desktop Linux but on Steam Deck, you'll want to keep it on the Low preset as certain maps and action can drop it below 30FPS. Overall it still looks great on Low on the Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of fun and certainly something a bit different. Really worth picking up for both Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Been having a lot of fun in duos with family and a fair bit in the solo mode too.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft Connect broke again but Valve fixed it in Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Launchers. Gotta love 'em right? Major publishers just love to make Steam Deck and Linux gaming that little bit more difficult. Ubisoft Connect broke again but Valve is here to save the day.</p>
<p>You might have noticed recently your Ubisoft games stopped working with some kind of error message when trying to load. Thankfully it didn't take Valve long to solve, with a new release of Proton Experimental now live from August 1st with the single fix noted being "Fixed Ubisoft Connect not working after its recent update". So you'll just need to switch your Ubisoft games over to Proton Experimental to get them working again.</p>
<p>Just head to your Downloads and you should see an update ready for Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Here is For Honor now working for example:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zdbd2aclg3o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/60944c09038294582b5f3cbbf158feed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zdbd2aclg3o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam desktop and Steam Deck get a fresh stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another big stable update to the Steam client for desktop and Steam Deck. So here's a run over what's new and changed.</p>
<p>As usual, the changes between them are basically the same, although one does seem actually just for the Steam Deck which is where Valve fixed a case where the wrong FPS limit could be applied on startup. There's also these fixes and improvements just for Linux which will likely affect SteamOS on Steam Deck too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the controller input thread could operate at normal instead of high scheduling priority.</li>
<li>Fixed file dialogs not appearing in some cases for systems without an active xdg-desktop-portal</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash when processing shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the UI would show the wrong image when switching between small mode and normal mode.</li>
<li>Additional fixes for file dialogs for systems where xdg-desktop-portal is not available.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Added timer to the overlay. You can enable this button in the in-game settings.</li>
<li>Improved library performance for users with large numbers of collections.</li>
<li>Fixed some confirmation dialogs not closing with the cancel or X buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed "Clear Download Cache" also deleting cached login information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause a Steam Guard code to fail the first time it is entered, and then succeed immediately after that.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Overlay not respecting Windows scale factor for full screen windows at heights &lt;= 1200px.</li>
<li>Fixed Windows scale factors &lt;150% not applying to Steam overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed a hitch that some players with large libraries might encounter every 15 minutes while playing a game.</li>
<li>Fixed main client window taking focus from other Steam windows when navigation menus are hovered.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications for achievements not firing when offline.</li>
<li>Fixed wallet balance not updating in title bar when balance hits zero.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect display of "Notify me about additions or changes to my games..." setting in interface settings if it had never been changed before.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Library</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to sort by date added to library to shelves and game grids.</li>
<li>Added a setting to display Steam Deck compatibility information in the library while not on a Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Overlay</p>
<ul>
<li>Added In-Game setting to allow enabling or disabling display scaling in the overlay.</li>
<li>Changed behavior of overlay tabbed browser to clear all tabs when the close button is clicked and added a minimize button to hide the browser as the close button previously did.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent crash in overlay browser when switching to overlay for in-game purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Big Picture Mode</p>

<p>The new timer feature on the desktop overlay sounds very useful. Allowing you to set any time you want and then when it's done you'll get a ping and a pop-up notifying you time is up. Could be incredibly useful for reminding you to take an actual break.</p>

      <title>Linux overtakes macOS users on Steam thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well it finally happened. According to the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for July 2023 we can see that Linux users have overtaken macOS.</p>
<p>For July 2023 the rankings overall are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.21% -0.56%</li>
<li>macOS 1.84% +0.05%</li>
<li>Linux 1.96% +0.52%</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a> here's the Linux user share on Steam over time:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17191886191690970475gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17191886191690970475gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A pretty massive increase and the biggest in a single month for years. So why? Well, considering Valve just recently had a huge sale on the Steam Deck, it's probably not all that surprising. A lot of people over the last month will have been playing with their Steam Deck that ships with SteamOS Linux. So I do expect it to go down a fair bit next month as things settle down again but I imagine it will continue trending higher overall and keep pushing upwards.</p>
<p>Here's the current most popular Linux distributions - showing that SteamOS (Steam Deck) is the clear winner:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.07% +2.74%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.94% -0.39%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 7.38% -0.49%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.99% -0.03%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 4.29% -0.08%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 3.84% -0.71%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.97% +2.97%</li>
<li>Other 25.52% -4.02%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 on Steam Deck is &#39;absolutely wild&#39; and aims for 30FPS on Medium</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly exciting! Ahead of the release of Baldur's Gate 3, which is going to easily be one of the biggest releases this year, the Director of Publishing at Larian Studios teased playing it on Steam Deck on Twitter (uh, sorry on "X").</p>
<p>Michael Douse (Director of Publishing) said on in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685281446863265792" target="_blank">post</a> on X "Playing Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck is absolutely wild. The quality of models etc really holds up in cinematics. Can’t wait for you to try it" and in a follow-up reply to another user about performance Douse mentioned "We’re aiming for solid 30 on around medium, but optimisation is ongoing. Worth remembering we have cross-save between PC and PS5 ;)".</p>
<p>The good news is that it will also have full controller support at launch as well. However, no split-screen co-op on Steam Deck as that was <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685989272099213312" target="_blank">disabled</a>. While you could hook it up to a bigger screen with a Docking Station, presumably this was done due to the lower power of the Deck.</p>

<p>Will you be picking it up? I've yet to hear back about a review key but I'm hoping to give it a run and see just how well it works on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It releases August 3rd.</p>

      <title>Rightfully, Beary Arms is an incredibly bizarre bullet-hell shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rightfully, Beary Arms is a weird and wonderfully whack twin-stick shooter rogue-lite that's now in Early Access with Native Linux support and it works on the Steam Deck too. <u>Note</u>: key provided by Stride PR.</p>
<p>Created by Daylight Basement Studio from Boston, North America, the cofounder Chris Bischke mentioned "Rightfully, Beary Arms was stitched and stuffed to be an enjoyable and approachable experience for both new and seasoned roguelite fans. Beary crushes the fears and anxieties kids face, and adults and children alike can cathartically squash our imagined aliens. Be like Beary!"</p>
<p>Well, they've definitely got a good start on something unique here. The style of it is quirky as heck, as are the weapons you can use and it's quite hilarious actually. Imagine something a bit like Enter the Gungeon only far more bizarre. There's lots of different weapons, you can upgrade weapons, you also get to pick and swap special abilities and as you get stronger - so do you enemies. However, you pick how your enemies get stronger here — really makes it interesting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gwDHcLr5uZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c434e6ba27582cb23b7fa871db9dcccb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gwDHcLr5uZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the Steam Deck there are some issues right now. The first is the initial loading time when starting a game, which feels like it takes forever. Some of the text on descriptions for things like weapons can also be a bit too small. Additionally, there are <em>numerous</em> rough performance blips where the game will stutter and drop so it's going to need some big optimizations to be something I would recommend there. The developer mentioned they'll be "making improvements to the Steam Deck Optimizations over the coming weeks". So I'll be checking back on it when they've done that.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux performance was much better of course, although the same drops can be seen but on a more powerful system with the FPS somewhere around 200FPS you don't even feel it.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of odd twin-stick rogue-lite shooters you'll enjoy this a <em>lot</em> but Steam Deck players will definitely want to wait for big optimizations. Delightfully silly so I look forward to seeing what they add during Early Access as they said the game only currently has half of the content they're planning. </p>

      <title>Parcel Simulator dev excited about Steam Deck support for you to find contraband</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Parcel Simulator is certainly not the type of game that would usually grab my attention but the Papers, Please inspiration and gameplay features look weirdly attractive. So now we too can run our own dream warehouse? Well, there's weirder games out there that got popular.</p>
<p>It's a first-person simulation and automation game, with a focus on parcel and package inspections for label discrepancies, contraband, and shipping defects. You take the role of a parcel sorting facility worker, working your way up to having a thriving, automated and self-sufficient parcel sorting centre, with automated conveyor belts, forklift trucks and storage racks, (+ a bunch of other cool stuff)!</p>
<p>Releasing in early 2024, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dg7qsNSO8Hw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f62dbef3583db53d9307ed7ba360ffb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dg7qsNSO8Hw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the solo developer Dan Yates of Scratchpost Studios they mentioned it will have full Steam Deck support. Clarifying with them if that meant Native Linux or support through Proton, and thoughts on desktop Linux support they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It'll be through Proton, as the build works really nicely that way for the project. In the same way, desktop Linux support will work fine with Proton too, but no native build planned as of yet.</p>
<p>I had a go a little while ago and was really impressed to see how nicely it worked out-the-box, and have since then focused on keeping the controller support working and also having the right graphics settings set up to keep the game running smoothly on the Deck!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asking Yates how it felt to develop a game with the Steam Deck they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've found it super exciting more than anything to be honest! Seeing your own game on a handheld like the Steam Deck for the first time is really cool as an otherwise PC-bound game dev.</p>
<p>Valve have done a stellar job making the Steam Deck super accessible for devs. As you know, under the hood it's just a Linux machine so it's really easy to transfer game builds onto it for testing. Proton works super nicely out-of-the-box too, and even on my very first build for the Deck it worked without any serious issues at all.</p>
<p>Development for a device like the Steam Deck (with its small screen and lower end hardware) has its challenges, but it's something I've been conscious about whilst developing:</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface and text scaling is something that's been super important for me, especially with all the text on labels and forms in Parcel Simulator. This isn't just limited to the Steam Deck either; people run games on all sorts of screen sizes and resolutions, so it's important that the text and UI are legible no matter what device you'll be playing the game on. It's easy enough to scale down my viewport whilst developing, or pop a quick build onto the Deck, to see how things look in reality from a player's point-of-view.</li>
<li>Performance is of course another thing worth mentioning. Parcel Sim definitely has a high-res feel about it, but because all the lighting is baked and the models have various LODs (level of detail) the performance ends up being really good, even on lower end hardware. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going into a little more detail on the work to ensure it performs well on Steam Deck and lower-end hardware Yates said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Baked lighting</strong> - baked lighting, as opposed to real-time lighting, means that the lighting information in the scene is calculated and saved before the game is installed on your device. This means that the lighting looks fantastic, but the hardware you’re running the game on doesn’t have to do any of the heavy lifting for rendering this lighting information. The scenes are still interlaced with some real-time lights, as just a few of these can make a world of difference for rendering real-time shadow information on objects that are spawned at runtime (such as parcels spawned in trucks, or conveyors built by players).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Level of Detail (LODs)</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> - 3D models are made up of polygons, a lot of polygons for that matter! The more polygons the engine (in my case Unreal Engine) has to render, the more performance this will require. When a player is far away from an object, or they’re running on reduced graphical settings, they don’t need to see the full polygon information for that object - instead it’d be totally fine for them to see a slightly less detailed version of the model. This is where LODs come in: all of the more complex 3D assets in Parcel Simulator have a few levels of LOD available, which means that these can be used as necessary whilst playing. If you can only see a conveyor belt from all the way on the other side of the warehouse on a couple pixels on your small screen, the game engine is better off rendering a much less detailed version of that conveyor belt to improve performance. This is especially true for the Steam Deck, as only the closest objects to the player need to be shown at their full level of complexity. Here’s an image of how LODs might look on a sphere:<br/>
<img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/991116211690813002gol1.png"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Object pooling</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> - no, not the swimming kind! In games, especially automation-flavoured games like Parcel Sim, there are lots and lots of objects being spawned at runtime. Object pooling is the practice of putting these dynamically spawned objects into a “pool” which can then be re-used later on in the game. Rather then despawning a parcel when submitting it and then spawning another identical parcel at the other end of the warehouse (an expensive operation), object pooling allows these spawned objects to simply be hidden, moved and made visible without any spawning or despawning taking place at all (from the engine’s perspective)! For anyone that’s played Factorio-style games before, object pooling is essential to keep the performance reasonable in large-scale factories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to being inspired by Papers, Please they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something oddly satisfying and addictive about cross-checking documents for issues in a video game! You know there’s always a chance that something could be incorrect, and so you’re checking and double checking for issues, hoping that you catch that small error or problem. Papers Please makes it easy enough to check through some basic passports at the start, but then quickly ramps up the difficulty in the later days, really keeping you on your toes. I loved that natural progression a lot, and I’ve tried to encompass that feeling in Parcel Sim - albeit with a 3D twist! The 3D aspect is something I saw a lot of potential for too, since it means that you’re able to go beyond document checks into the realm of opening up packages, performing interactive tests and checks on contents, and a bunch of other fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, on why they think you should buy it when it's out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Parcel Simulator, you begin with a small, hands-on facility where you can spend your days manually inspecting parcels for contraband and labelling issues, or developing and expanding your warehouse with automated machines and intricate conveyor systems. With the help of some careful automation, you can watch your facility grow into a thriving sorting centre that operates exactly how you want it to. Through meticulous parcel inspections and in-depth warehouse customisation, Parcel Simulator aims to provide endlessly satisfying gameplay to casual and experienced players alike. Parcel Simulator will be releasing to Steam in Q1 of 2024, with a demo due to be released later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All sounds great and it certainly now has my curiosity piqued.</p>

      <title>DevilutionX for classic Diablo and Hellfire now on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a perhaps easier way to get DevilutionX for classic Diablo running on Steam Deck and desktop Linux? Well it's now on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.diasurgical.DevilutionX" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. This means on Steam Deck, you can just grab DevilutionX from Discover and install it there. For desktop Linux - whatever way you would normally install a Flatpak from Flathub.</p>
<p>DevilutionX is a source port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game on modern operating systems while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features. This includes support for higher resolutions, controller and touch control support, stash, optional experience and enemy health bars and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8275788091690801061gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8275788091690801061gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Diablo with DevilutionX on Linux</em></p>
<p>With the Flathub release it comes with the demo content, so you can at least try it out. But you do need to buy a copy of Diablo to run the full game with it - which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo" target="_blank">purchase from GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you do pick up the full game you can copy over "DIABDAT.MPQ" to:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.diasurgical.DevilutionX/data/diasurgical/devilution</code></p>
<p>As for Hellfire you need to copy "hellfire.mpq", "hfmonk.mpq", "hfmusic.mpq" and "hfvoice.mpq" to the same location.</p>
<p><em>DevilutionX did already offer an AppImage but some people may prefer the Flatpak.</em></p>

      <title>Tactical RPG &#39;Arcadian Atlas&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcadian Atlas is a 2D isometric tactical role playing game about the choices people make in pursuit of the things they love, and the havoc it wreaks on a kingdom. It looks great with some wonderful pixel-art for fans of games like Final Fantasy Tactics. </p>
<p>Available now with Native Linux support and while it has no official Steam Deck rating yet it should work great, with the developer regularly testing it prior to release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to save Arcadia, players need to build an elite party of adventurers from more than 12 unique classes, each with their own custom skill trees and equipment ranging from potion-brewing apothecaries to magic-channeling warmancers. Strategic, turn-based battles will determine the fate of both the kingdom of Arcadia and its people. Every single action counts: just one wrong move could tear your party and the land itself apart for good.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4sUwpVQrDPM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5f6cec342f5caef7541b85d53a2e7bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4sUwpVQrDPM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/arcadian-atlas-developer-interview/" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> also recently interviewed the developer. Here's an interesting excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I know that a native Linux version of the game will be released as well. Were there any challenges unique to developing for Linux over Windows or Mac?</strong></p>
<p>Paddy, our programmer, hit the ground running with Linux from the outset, and we were constantly cognizant of both Linux and Mac needs while developing within Unity to ensure we could deliver stellar experiences across all three platforms. And Unity makes that incredibly easy as well, to the point where we were pretty shocked there weren’t more issues taking a Windows build to Mac or Linux, but the process was relatively painless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Land - Travel through the vast and beautiful landscape of Arcadia, battling across dozens of maps including ancient ruins, seaside villages, snow-capped mountains, and verdant forests.</li>
<li>Engage in Strategic Battles - Utilize 150+ unique combat skills to shift the tides of the battlefield. Deploy tactical traps, use magic to buff your soldiers’ abilities, and exploit your enemies’ weaknesses to gain victory.</li>
<li>Rally the Troops - Build an army from 12 different classes; customize their mastery across 25 unique skill trees; and arm them with weapons, armor, and powerful accessories to amplify their abilities.</li>
<li>Experience the Masterpiece - Enjoy the exquisite ambiance of Arcadia with an inspired jazz-infused soundtrack and detailed art nouveau-style character portraits.</li>
<li>Discover the Epic Narrative - As fates intertwine, the heart-wrenching stories of Vashti, Desmond, and all of Arcadia unfold in this rich tale of war and magic across 70+ unique campaign encounters.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/691790/Arcadian_Atlas/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Broforce FOREVER arrives for the legendary action platformer on August 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably my absolutely favourite action platformer for the over time action and hilarious characters, Broforce is set for the Broforce FOREVER update on August 8th.</p>
<p>This is the final update to the game so the forever naming sees appropriate. It will offer up "an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra-patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j3J3zLLnRU0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3cd7b73b0fb411e1b270409db1182a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j3J3zLLnRU0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new BROS being added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Seth Brondle</strong> - Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of <em>Broforce Forever’s</em> biggest bug yet. Climb on ceilings and utilize explosive teleportation as you swat evildoers like flies.</p>
<p><strong>Xebro</strong> - Use your formidable fighting and flying Chakram skills to help those who are unable to defend themselves. Strike fear into the hearts of terrorism with your war cry, then cut them up real good with your sword.</p>
<p><strong>Desperabro</strong> - Harness the power of music to enchant evil before blowing it away with dual-sawed-off shotguns. Every man deserves one last chance to dance before he dies.</p>
<p><strong>Broffy the Vampire Slayer</strong> - Become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake-throwing, unholy monster purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer.</p>
<p><strong>Bro Gummer</strong> - Embrace freedom in the most patriotic way possible: OVERKILL. Snipe your way around the world vanquishing evil with pinpoint accuracy, or just get back to basics and ram dynamite down its throat.</p>
<p><strong>Demolition Bro</strong> - Send a maniac to catch a maniac. With his Bouncing Bomberman Bomb and Freeze Grenade, this Bro is ready to put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bunch of new enemies will also appear including motorbikes that try to run you down, large machine gun placements, and something about aviation enthusiasts that transport troops and fire bazookas from on high in their liberty-shunning new blimps. Level design adjustments too including a bunch of new barbed wire and sandbags strewn throughout cities making things a lil more challenging in places.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/broforce?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/broforce" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Broforce has a Native Linux version and it is also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress publisher Kitfox helping roguelike Caves of Qud to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud from Freehold Games is probably the absolutely wildest roguelike I've ever played and now the developers are teaming up with Dwarf Fortress publisher Kitfox Games to publishing it with the final release in 2024.</p>
<p>This is great news because Caves of Qud is truly excellent, and more people deserve to know about it and experience it. With publishing help, the developers can focus more on polishing the 1.0 release! Thanks to the partnership Qud also has a fancy trailer now:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2c6burNvtsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd58887074390f4c94399bd41f6b179.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2c6burNvtsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The partnership makes sense on so many levels,” says Jason Grinblat, co-founder at Freehold Games. “First, Tanya is one of our oldest friends in the industry, and we've already worked with her on a few non-game projects. Second, we love what Kitfox has been doing over the past few years, both as an inspiring indie developer and as a publisher carving out a really distinctive niche. And third, of course: <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. Few games have had as big an impact on <em>Caves of Qud</em> as DF. It's humbling to be mentioned alongside the legend, and it's delightful to lock arms with our friends and some of our favorite devs ever, Tarn &amp; Zach Adams.”</p>
<p>"We've always loved <em>Caves of Qud</em> as an alternate-dimension take on deep world simulation, where a skilled writer prioritized certain elements of atmosphere at every turn in the design,” says Kitfox Captain, Tanya X. Short. “So when we heard Kitfox could help Qud get to 1.0, we leapt at the chance. It's a crime that not enough <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> fans have heard of this cousin, an underrated gem of a game made by lovely people, and we hope we can help spread the word to those who would adore it."</p>
<p>You can buy it right now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>I love the animated ASCII artwork in Stone Story RPG - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some really fun animated ASCII artwork, Stone Story RPG is a really interesting mixture of an auto-RPG with strategic combat, crafting, programming and more. An incredibly unique game where descriptions and screenshots really don't tell you enough, you need to watch it and experience it to actually get it. Just be careful, this one is easy to get lost in for hours and hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14232091981690637656gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14232091981690637656gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Stone Story is an RPG set in a dark and ominous world. Monsters and mysteries plague the realm. Embark on a quest to unite 9 magic Soul Stones and restore the light.</p>
<p>The game takes elements from various genres and repackages them into a wholly unique experience. One of Stone Story's defining mechanics is that you have no direct control of the player character, as an A.I. does all the exploring, combat and looting. Though this is an auto-RPG, that doesn't mean it's an idle game. Potions and special abilities are maximized by good timing. Boss fights are intense, requiring quick item swaps if the boss changes patterns.</p>
<p>Your natural curiosity will be your greatest tool as you delve into the game and discover there's more beneath its deceptively simple surface."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dBQRsjNwuNM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8e72ae4703ad280b3fa7675becd0a4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dBQRsjNwuNM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After nearly a decade of development, the 1.0 release is here now. Although, they're clearly not done with it. The developer said to expect to continue seeing updates adding in additional mechanics to new events, new items, new difficulties, new locations and more.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stunning ASCII animation and gorgeous music</li>
<li>Robust player A.I. that combines with other game systems to offer a unique experience for gamers of all types</li>
<li>8 unique Locations, each with their own meticulously detailed environments and intense boss fights</li>
<li>Simple, but deep crafting system</li>
<li>Dozens of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategies</li>
<li>A rich fantasy world with eccentric enemies, amusing NPC encounters and engaging lore</li>
<li>8+ hours of main story gameplay, in addition to procedurally generated content</li>
<li>Plenty of secrets!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603390/Stone_Story_RPG/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Also available as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/26121/Linux__Thrills/" target="_blank">LINUX &amp; THRILLS bundle</a> on Steam.</p>

      <title>For Honor from Ubisoft gets an anti-cheat update - now Playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more bigger publisher jumping in to get their games working on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Ubisoft has now upgraded For Honor to support Easy Anti-Cheat on Deck.</p>
<p>Published in their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/for-honor/news-updates/6jz99oXbJUVyK5h17fp6B8/patch-notes-2451-for-honor" target="_blank">July 27th update</a> it notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EASY ANTI-CHEAT </p>
<p>Updated Easy Anti-Cheat client module and library. <br/>
Developer's Comment:* This update of Easy Anti-Cheat makes the game playable on Steam Deck.* </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to that, Valve also ran the game through verification bumping it up to a Steam Deck Playable rating with Proton Experimental (as seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/304390/history/?changeid=19683830" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) as it was previously Unsupported. It's Playable now and <em>not</em> Verified as Valve notes it still has issues with a launcher, it can show non-Steam Deck controller icons, you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and it doesn't close properly so you need to force-close on it.</p>
<p>So Ubisoft have done the <em>bare minimum</em> to make it work. Hopefully they will also address the other issues to get it bumped up to Verified properly.</p>
<p>Trying it myself: it did initially get completely stuck sitting on a Uplay "Looking for patches" screen for a long time. Closing and reopening then just fixed it and it did it almost instantly. Logging into to Ubisoft Account also did need the touchscreen and manual on-screen keyboard (STEAM + X). After that logging in worked just fine, although it then gave me the full Ubisoft Connect app instead of launching the game. Closing and re-opening it then asked me for a CD Key, which is apparently a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/304390/discussions/0/3807281795250711046/" target="_blank">problem for many people</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/304390/discussions/0/3807281795249566983/" target="_blank">even more people</a> even though it's supposed to be having a free weekend.</p>
<p>So, for science, I <em>purchased</em> the game. Thinking that would give me the needed key. Apparently that <em>doesn't work</em> either and I am also not alone in that problem. Seems they're having problems with their CD Key server so it may very well be supported on Steam Deck now but any <em>new</em> purchases or free weekend players are stuck until they fix it.</p>
<p>Third-party launchers on Steam are bad enough but third-party key generation is even worse. What a mess.</p>
<p><strong>Update - 31/07/23</strong>: they did eventually fix the key issue, so I have been able to actually get in and confirm the game does indeed work now on Steam Deck. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5580871331690815061gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5580871331690815061gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304390/FOR_HONOR/" target="_blank">play it free on Steam</a> until August 3rd and it's also 80% off during this time.</em></p>

      <title>Persona 5 Strikers fully playable on Steam Deck with this tweak</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since its release in October 2022, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a> has been one of the perfect Steam Deck games. Persona 5 Royal's design being very well suited for handheld play; combined with being a very well optimized PC Port overall. Its sequel / spin-off, Persona 5 Strikers, has not fared so well. Despite launching on Steam in February 2021, well before Persona 5 Royal, Persona 5 Strikers is still listed as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While Strikers has been mostly playable, cutscene audio didn't play and given that Strikers carries the story heavy design of Persona, that might as well be unplayable. However, thanks to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1382330#03yxM1tHaR" target="_blank">Swish on Proton DB</a>, this issue has been resolved and Persona 5 Strikers can be played start to end on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10381937151690488954gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10381937151690488954gol15416.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - The Cold Open of Persona 5 Strikers Tested on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>In order to implement this fix, you'll need to set Compatibility to GE Proton 8 (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GE-Proton Guide</a>). I personally used 8-3 but you might be able to use newer versions. After that you'll need to enter this code into your launch options: </p>
<p><code>GST_PLUGIN_FEATURE_RANK=protonaudioconverterbin:NONE %command%</code></p>
<p>Once done you can test it by just starting a new game as the game immediately hits you with an anime cutscene. </p>
<p>My testing showed that I could run Strikers at a stable 60 fps on mid settings and the Steam Performance Overlay showed a two-to-three-hour battery life from a 90% charge. This beats out the Switch version, which could only do 30 fps, and puts the Deck on par with the PS4 version running on PS5.</p>
<p>Given the fast-paced hack and slash design of Strikers compared to Royal's turn-based design, 60 fps is more important here than it was in Royal. Keep that in mind if you decide to cut back settings to save battery life. I did experiment with the settings and found that 40 fps was still smooth, but 30 fps was just too far back.</p>

      <title>Combat-free RPG set in an occult library BOOK OF HOURS launches August 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing on August 17th from developer Weather Factory, BOOK OF HOURS is an "elegant, melancholy, combat-free RPG set in an occult library" and it certainly looks <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>From the creator of Cultist Simulator, it's going to offer up they say around 20 - 40 hours of sweet peace as you organise books and customise your new home, all while peeling away centuries of history from the occult stones about you. Sounds peculiar and quite interesting.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new final trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="38D565xKp-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07d8dc4778c4c32bad9417c492edff6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/38D565xKp-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the game you will:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACQUIRE, RESTORE and CATALOGUE</strong> occult books, scrolls and curiosities.</li>
<li><strong>STUDY the nine Wisdoms</strong>, and conquer the nine Elements of the Soul.</li>
<li><strong>GUIDE visitors who come seeking your assistance</strong>, choosing their paths and stories.</li>
<li><strong>EXPLORE the Secret Histories</strong> and the pantheon of Hours that rules them.</li>
<li><strong>RESTORE a vast crumbling edifice</strong> built on the foundations of an ancient abbey.</li>
<li><strong>WREST your past from obscurity.</strong> Choose from nine different Legacies which determine who you are. You might be a Magnate, abandoning wealth to seek peace. Or an Archaeologist, fleeing the curse you awoke. Or perhaps your origins are more esoteric, like the Symurgist, or Twiceborn? Each playthrough offers different opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to Lottie Bevan of Weather Factory via email, they confirmed Linux support very clearly just like their previous game mentioning "Absolutely. It'll be available on native Linux at launch. :)".</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/book_of_hours" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1028310/BOOK_OF_HOURS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on August 17th.</p>

      <title>Homeworld Remastered Collection and Severed Steel are free on Epic Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a space-nerd, I couldn't miss telling you that you can grab the <em>entire</em> Homeworld Remastered Collection free on Epic Games right now.</p>
<p>Thanks to Wine / Proton, they're all playable on Linux and Steam Deck too. Grabbing games from Epic on Linux is trivial nowadays too thanks to the excellent Heroic Games Launcher (which just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/heroic-games-launcher-29-out-now-with-amazon-games-support/" target="_blank">had a big update</a>). Homeworld Remastered Collection is rated Steam Deck Unsupport (but it works) but it was rated as Playable previously, and it's also rated Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/244160" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>Homeworld Remastered Collection also recently had an update to add in cross-platform multiplayer between Steam and Epic so grabbing it free would still enable you to play with friends elsewhere (as it should be!). Grab it <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/homeworld-remastered-collection" target="_blank">free on Epic Games</a> until August 3rd.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pA7FbYAmrX0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d081007abc9e3b2d5bcfedf6c0c53146.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pA7FbYAmrX0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can also grab Severed Steel, an intense single-player FPS featuring a stylish movement system, completely destructible levels, and an acclaimed OST <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/severed-steel" target="_blank">free on Epic Games</a> until August 3rd. Severed Steel is rated Steam Deck Playable and Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1227690" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Yr9olh1yqk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91aa61a823cdcdc79eb3d04c470db484.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Yr9olh1yqk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just two quick easy recommendations to go and grab for free. Enjoy your gaming! </p>
<p>If you do have a particular Wine / Wine-GE / Proton combination you feel works best with each game in <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic</a>, or your preferred launcher (perhaps <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>?) do let readers know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Check out the new demo for Aurora: The Lost Medallion - The Cave</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aurora: The Lost Medallion - The Cave is an upcoming coming-of-age tale of destiny, friendship, and discovery. From Noema Games and Gamera Games, it's a hand-painted point and click adventure that will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You are Aurora, the youngest inhabitant of the Cave. Raised by intelligent machines in a hidden world of technological wonders, a group of kids spend their days preparing for the mysterious “Pilgrimage”, each guided by an equally mysterious voice. As the only child without a Voice to guide her, Aurora must challenge the rigid society of the Cave to gain the title of Pilgrim and embark on an adventure to answer the unsolved question of her origins. The developers said the new demo should give you around an hour of gameplay, but a bit longer if you find some of the puzzles challenging.</p>

      <title>Open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver &#39;NVK&#39; gears up for merging into Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is exciting as heck! Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand and various contributors have been powering through developing NVK, the open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA.</p>
<p>It's come along rather nicely in such a short time, that they're now preparing to have it actually merged into Mesa along with the rest of the open source graphics for Linux.</p>
<p>A majority of the work was done by Ekstrand with Collabora, with Karol Herbst from Red Hat also doing "a lot of the ground work and has done a lot of debugging and figuring out what we need to do on various generations", plus Dave Airlie of Red Hat also doing a bunch of needed Linux kernel work.</p>
<p>What's the current status? According to the draft it has a "pretty solid set at this point" which Google Summer of Code developer Mohamed Ahmed working through YCbCr support and when that is done it should have Vulkan 1.2 support with plenty of features on top of that.</p>
<p>Currently they don't have everything needed for DXVK, VKD3D-Proton and Zink but they've got "most" of it. So perhaps it won't be too long until NVIDIA GPU owners can use Mesa to run Vulkan games, that would be pretty amazing.</p>
<p>As for hardware support, Collabora told me: “Initially, Turing (20XX and 16XX series) and later. Eventually, we want to go as far back as Kepler (6XX and 7XX series)”.</p>
<p>Their plan is to get it merged into Mesa once the Linux kernel patches are ready, so you'll need a newer or patched kernel to actually make use of NVK.</p>
<p>You can see the draft <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24326" target="_blank">merge request here</a> and <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/next-step-for-nvk-merging-into-mesa.html" target="_blank">Collabora announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Goodbye free time I have discovered Timberborn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A city-building colony-sim where a bunch of Beavers are building a society long after us pesky humans died off is not a thing I thought I needed but Timberborn is properly great. <u>Note</u>: key provided by Evolve PR.</p>
<p>It's playable on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with Proton, with it working without issues with Proton 8. On the Steam Deck specifically, it's rated as "Playable" due to the controls not being gamepad friendly and needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>While it's similar in many ways to other city-builders on a basic level, the game feels a lot more wholesome thanks to your furry friends running around doing all the work. And while the basics of it are similar to other city-builders, it pretty quickly becomes its own game thanks to the very clever vertical building system that can take a good bit of time to really understand properly to make use of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15481922951690302224gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15481922951690302224gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Timberborn on Fedora KDE 38, running smooth!</em></p>
<p>This actually nicely reminds me of playing through some of the early The Settlers games. This isn't just a city-builder though. It's also a game of survival, a colony-builder where you're responsible for keeping a whole bunch of critters alive through some tough times. The early game is very much "aww, little Beavers cutting down some trees" and it's slightly hilarious seeing Beavers work a farm which later evolves into "oh my god another drought, they're all going to die". </p>
<p>In terms of performance on my desktop with Fedora KDE 38 using an AMD Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti, on max settings it's been a very smooth 60FPS the entire time. Absolutely no issues with performance and I've yet to see any issues at all with it there. The developers have certainly done a good job on optimization, even when there's a ridiculous amount of moving parts and it shows how good Proton is nowadays for all types of gaming on Linux too.</p>
<p>All the <em>little</em> details I've simply <em>loved</em> seeing here. It's the simple things like how building power lines isn't just straight cables. Say you need a corner, well you'll get two opposing cogs turning to keep it going. Such delightful design.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18100526811690303329gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's a lot to it and you don't get a whole lot in the way of an introduction, which in this case is actually quite good. The tutorial that's around an hour long gives you the real basic setup of how to become a little bit self-sufficient. As soon as you are, it waves goodbye and leaves you to fend off the elements. That first time you get a drought come in too — wow that was unexpected and it happens quickly too.</p>
<p>Getting to grips with how to effectively keep your Beavers alive through all the droughts is quite a learning curve. Learning how to properly manage water storage, building dams and properly routing it around your colony. It's easier said than done, or perhaps I'm just not as smart as your average Beaver. The reality is that Timberborn is a city-builder where everything revolves around the basics of water. If you don't have a supply of it your crops will die, trees will die, your Beavers will get thirsty and die and the ground just becomes a wasteland. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4469551681690306826gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4469551681690306826gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Eventually though, you will learn how to manage water through the droughts and once you do, the game opens up a whole lot more because it's less of a panic about staying alive. Then the real fun begins, because then you get to build a really big dam to expand what water you can control on the map, and let it flow once it's built-up to keep flowing downstream so you can keep power flowing too. However, you do need to ensure you've got some barriers in place because water finds a way…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4272230621690308625gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4272230621690308625gol1.jpg"/></a>Oops.</em></p>
<p>For Steam Deck the experience is actually quite surprising. It works out of the box but the text and interface is a little on the small side. Thankfully, it has UI scaling in the settings and sticking it up to the max at 140% made it basically perfection. I shouldn't be impressed when a game has UI scaling but sadly it's still rare even in a lot of new releases now, so it's just nice to see it in an unfinished game working so well like in Timberborn.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16393047561690400016gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16393047561690400016gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance is the other surprising thing. Even with lots going on, on Ultra details it was hitting 60FPS without a problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1062090/view/6083844525375414462" target="_blank">Back in May</a> the developers released Update 4, and in the release notes they mentioned performance was improved by "by up to 80%" and it really shows even on some of the big busy maps. Even with no official controller support, thanks to the easy interface it feels just about fine with Steam Input emulating a mouse / keyboard and quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Timberborn <em>isn't</em> finished since it's Early Access but what's there can already give you multiple tens of hours of gameplay, and easily into the 100s of hours depending on what type of gamer you are. There's so many different ways to build up a Beaver colony in this game it could just keep you entertained forever.</p>
<p>You also have modding support in the game currently <a href="https://mod.io/g/timberborn" target="_blank">via mod.io</a>, with a full map editor included in the game so there's a fair amount you can add into the game as extras too. Eventually the developer said they do plan to hook up the Steam Workshop too but no ETA on that.</p>
<p>If you're after a game to sink your big teeth into and chomp away for hours, Timberborn is a great choice. </p>

      <title>Learn to make no-code games with GDevelop and Fanatical</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to make games but don't know how to code? The free and open source <a href="https://gdevelop.io/" target="_blank">GDevelop</a> is a great cross-platform tool with an events-driven system.</p>
<p>Something I've covered a few times here on GamingOnLinux because I <em>love</em> the idea of it, and I grew up making little games in similar tools like the classic The Games Factory and Clickteam Fusion. It's pretty fun to just test things out in GDevelop, and you can throw something together pretty quickly with it.</p>
<p>They've <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/easy-no-code-game-design-bundle?ref=gol" target="_blank">teamed up with Fanatical</a> offer a growing<em>*</em> bundle of assets and a 6 month subscription to their Silver Premium plan that gives you some added extras like cloud building, cloud projects, a mobile app and more extras that you may find helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19680424981690381771gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19680424981690381771gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7055095631690381773gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7055095631690381773gol1.png"/></a><br/>
Pictured - an example GDevelop project and the events sheet. Click pictures to enlarge.</p>
<p>GDevelop is constantly improving too and since it's cross-platform, free and open source you can try it any time.</p>
<p><em>*Fanatical say to keep an eye out "for new additions to this bundle in future as there's so much more to come with GDevelop &amp; Fanatical".</em></p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets another update with lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Summer Event live until September 15th, 2023 it seems Valve still aren't quite done updating Team Fortress 2 with the renewed popularity. Team Fortress 2 managed to smash its all time player record at 253,997 around 2 weeks ago, but it's settled back down to around 100,000 now.</p>
<p>Still, the updates aren't yet the kind of thing many were hoping for after Valve originally said the recent update would be a "full-on update-sized update" and then later changed it to say it was a "full-on holiday-sized update". At least they're giving it <em>some</em> attention though right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17134057931690380475gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17134057931690380475gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Armored Core VI will be &#39;fully supported&#39; on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay now THIS is exciting as heck. Armored Core VI Fires Of Rubicon will be "fully supported" on Steam Deck according to FromSoftware.</p>
<p>As mentioned in an article on <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/armored-core-6-fully-supported-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a> who spoke to Game Director Masaru Yamamura, and producer Yasunori Ogura, with Ogura revealing "Obviously seeing how well Elden Ring performed on the Steam Deck, we were very happy, and we wanted to at least create that as a baseline going forward for this handheld. So it is fully supported for Steam Deck … we just want to reassure players that it will be fully supported."</p>
<p>There's also a brand new gameplay preview video out:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DcDjyestr4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2ea5156c0158b316d23de45b419aa1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DcDjyestr4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining FromSoftware’s longstanding expertise in mech games with their signature action gameplay, ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON brings a brand-new action experience to the series.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dynamic, Omni-directional Battles</strong><br/>
Players will pilot their mech in fast-paced, omni-directional battles, taking advantage of massive stages and their mech’s mobility on land and in the air to ensure victory.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Customized Parts for Individual Battle Styles</strong><br/>
Customize Armored Core parts to suit a large variety of playstyles. Selecting different parts not only changes the mech’s attacks, but also directly affects its movement and battle style, so each mission can be approached with a unique mech strategy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Thrilling Boss Battles</strong><br/>
Deploy a wide variety of offensive and defensive tactics at close and long range to take down powerful enemy bosses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really can't tell you how excited I am by this one. A proper big-budget mech game, it looks like everything I've wanted in such a game for years. You can absolutely bet I will be taking a look at this one on desktop Linux and Steam Deck for the release! Will you be picking it up too?</p>
<p>It releases on August 24th with pre-purchase available on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888160/ARMORED_CORE_VI_FIRES_OF_RUBICON/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is Steam Deck Verified and out today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is great to see. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart from Insomniac Games, Nixxes Software and PlayStation is out on Steam today and it's Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>You can read a little more on the work behind the Windows PC release on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/18/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-specs-and-new-features-revealed/" target="_blank">PlayStation blog</a> from last week. On Steam Deck and desktop Linux it will run with the Proton compatibility layer, specifically Valve set the Steam Deck Verified status to use Proton Experimental.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i_jZ3BV6Adc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b79677925a79e6c335f481dee2ffec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i_jZ3BV6Adc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully this means it has been <em>properly</em> tested with a smooth 30FPS at a <em>minimum</em>. As we've seen quite a few times though, some titles seem to get Verified for Steam Deck even though they clearly have glaring issues. Like our friends at SteamDeckHQ <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ/status/1684144428511035392" target="_blank">pointing out</a> the Verified title Remnant II having <em>really</em> bad performance.</p>

      <title>The Warhammer themed boomer-shooter, Boltgun, is finally Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest game to ride the boomer shooter craze, Warhammer 40K: Boltgun, has finally attained Steam Deck Verification as of today according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2005010/view/3660914264336762646?l=english" target="_blank">its own Steam Page</a>.</p>
<p>Since release, Boltgun<em> </em>was playable but users reported issues from cut-scenes not playing, the Deck not being recognized as a controller, and inconsistent performance issues. While the game has been reported as fully playable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/warhammer-40000-boltgun-now-fully-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">since early July</a>, you still had to install Proton 8. No more however, as Boltgun just runs out of the box with no configuration.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11419653141690307030gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11419653141690307030gol15416.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured: Boltgun running on Steam Deck post verification.</em></p>
<p>As I was in the midst of a Boltgun run, I downloaded it to my Deck and sure enough the first cutscene played and the Deck was recognized as a controller. Then I went to my last unlocked mission, Chapter 3 Mission 1, which is filled with lava and tons of enemies. Sure enough, Boltgun maintained a smooth 60fps. Which if you're not familiar with Boomer Shooters, maintaining a smooth 60fps is basically a requirement.</p>
<p>You can see Liam's past coverage here:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rc6MG0-vKrQ?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/948262fdfafb811992d1864cdf0cafc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rc6MG0-vKrQ?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That said, this is the kind of game that plays better on Mouse and Keyboard. But that's more of a nitpick and doesn't affect it being able to be played On Deck. Simply put: if you've been wanting to spread the word of the Emperor in an ultra-violent fashion on the go now's your chance.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/warhammer-40000-boltgun?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Originally created for the Atari 2600 back in 2021 (yes, really), Mr. Run and Jump has been recreated properly for modern systems from Atari and Graphite Lab. Seems it caught Atari's eye if they wanted to team up to remake it in full. Like a lot of recent games published by Atari, it also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>What is it? A very vibrant and colourful precision-platformer, one for those of you who like a good challenge. More: "Thrust into the beautiful Realms of Color, the titular Mr. Run and Jump embarks on a fast-paced, fluorescent adventure to defeat the menacing Void and rescue his missing dog, Leap. This title demands players use their wits as well as their dexterity. Mr. Run and Jump features precise controls, silky smooth gameplay, and free-flowing level design, making it a speedrunner’s dream. As the titular hero, players must run, jump, dash, and roll to hard-to-reach locations to find collectibles. Players can also adjust the difficulty level via Dynamic Assistance to enjoy a more approachable experience with the heart-pounding peril cranked down a couple of notches." — <em>ÜberStrategist PR for Atari</em>.</p>

      <title>Check out the upgraded demo for Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is an upcoming squad tactics heist RPG, from Trese Brothers who created Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce.</p>
<p>The developer previously put up a demo for the last Steam Next Fest, but now with the Steam Stealth Fest live they decided to not only keep the demo up but they've expanded and fixed up the demo based on a lot of feedback they directly received from the previous event.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19353145881690289993gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19353145881690289993gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I spent a bit of time in the demo and came away quite impressed. It feels really slick, with a nice mixture of abilities across the different types of characters. Everything about it feels a lot <em>smoother</em> compared with the likes of XCOM too and their Native Linux build of the demo has been running great on max settings too.</p>
<p>All the changes since the last demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Security AI's thoughts and actions are visible between turns</li>
<li>Roster is now unlocked to view characters (customization still locked)</li>
<li>Check out recruits in the roster before hiring on to team</li>
<li>Heist Advantages now available</li>
<li>New UI for Victory/Defeat use the mission map from mission planning</li>
<li>Improved SFX around moving</li>
<li>Fixed bug where Sec Tally did not immediately respond to camera spotting</li>
<li>Improved Rooftop level objective area</li>
<li>Fixed issues that could cause hunting AI to skip turns at times</li>
<li>Rebuilt mission victory and defeat screens</li>
<li>Medkits and other healing effects show their effect in the target's HP bar</li>
<li>Improved sensitivity of mouse rotation (right click, rotate)</li>
<li>Damage from grenades is immediately visible as the mouse is moved to target them</li>
<li>Improved colors in HP bars to make the damage done always visible every single frame</li>
<li>Improved performance of mission map hovers - will never lag behind or skip off target when panning or rotating</li>
<li>Cleaned up very small "skip" at the end of most character's movements</li>
<li>Active Buffs and Debuffs have correct icons and duration shown in character and enemy hovers</li>
<li>Improved visual clarity of potential damage in target's Health Bar, no frames where the value can't be seen</li>
<li>Improved Cameras and Radar Array to be more accurate in their detection</li>
<li>Improved logic as to which enemy agents can be called off their current duty by security events</li>
<li>Combat logs for Cameras and Radar Arrays include the character name that was spotted specifically</li>
<li>Fixed bug where enemy could take 3+ Overwatch shots in some situations</li>
<li>Fixed bug with Vanguard's Overdrive Talent, guard who spots her might not stop moving immediately</li>
<li>Fixed bug where engaging movement Talents like Cybersword "Lightfoot" did not update warnings about heard in movement path</li>
<li>Fixed control issue where Talents like Cybersword "Lightfoot" would not allow you to toggle Sprint/Sneak</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing aggro enemies to move to the far side of players when repositioning for attack</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing aggro enemies capable of attacking a player to freeze and not move for the turn</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing enemy agents to freeze in some security situations</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing enemy agents to teleport in some security situations</li>
<li>Fixed bug when reloading save, an enemy agent might start acting while cut-scene is running</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing target circle to be hidden with Charged Attack / Conduit Edge melee attacks</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing inconsitent "out of range" results when clicking an enemy vs. clicking Talent</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing Hunker buff to automatically activate if player starts Overwatch or if player dies from enemy Overwatch</li>
<li>Fixed bug where characters and enemies might start to float slightly off the ground after moving a few times</li>
<li>Fixed bug allowing you to run through the doorframe of small doors</li>
<li>Fixed bug allowing you to stand in the railing of elevators</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect keybinding shown on ESC menu, fixed Enter is really "Delay or End Action"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not just that, they've also announced some more release info. While their estimate may change, they're now saying the release is likely to happen around the start of Q4 instead of near the end of Q3. So it's most likely to arrive towards the start of October 2023. So a little bit longer to wait but clearly it will be worth it with how they're reacting and improving based on the feedback from the demo.</p>
<p>As a big fan of squad-based tactical games (hello XCOM), I'm very keen to see the finished product here.</p>

      <title>Devs of Superior: Vengeance detail their Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Superior: Vengeance is an Early Access hyper-stylized superhero third-person co-op shooter, and the good news for Steam Deck players is the developer is ensuring it works great.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ck4IMUeO-is"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fb7f8cceaf8e9b688596bd1fee619b1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ck4IMUeO-is" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1297490/view/3659787820511285039" target="_blank">update on Steam</a>, they've noted how they've submitted it for verification but they've also been working on the game and testing it on Steam Deck to ensure it all works properly. With the latest update here's what they said they've done and what the status is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck/controller icons:  We have integrated Steam Deck and controller icons within the game, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive gaming experience.</p>
<p>Seamless functionality: Superior: Vengeance has been optimized to ensure that all functionality is accessible when using the default controller configuration. You’ll be able to dive right into the action without any hassle.</p>
<p>On screen keyboard support: When joining a lobby, you can easily enter text by manually invoking the on-screen keyboard</p>
<p>Optimal performance: Superior: Vengeance runs at a resolution supported by the Steam Deck, ensuring crisp visuals and smooth gameplay. The default graphics configuration has been fine-tuned to perform well on the device.</p>
<p>Legible interface: All in-game interface text has been carefully designed to be legible on the Steam Deck’s screen, so you won’t need to squint or strain your eyes to read important information.</p>
<p>Initial setup and gameplay: An active internet connection is required for the initial setup and for all gameplay modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, they said how they're "committed to delivering the best experience possible both on and off the Steam Deck" - so we can expect it to continue working well as it's developed through Early Access.</p>
<p>Great to see more developers take an active role in ensuring Steam Deck support. Which also means it should work great on desktop Linux too if it performs well on Deck. Seems they will have more to do though, like making the on-screen keyboard actually be automatic but it's a nice start.</p>

<p>If you have Amazon Prime, you get a bunch of games each month to claim through Prime Gaming and no doubt some of you have built up quite a collection right? Now you can just grab them on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with Heroic! Also syncing up playtime tracking for GOG games is nice touch too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10321672041690281476gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10321672041690281476gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, more streaming services should now work when added into Heroic as they've added support for DRM in browser apps. Although, it's <em>limited</em> on Linux, since we only get a certain level of stuff like Widevine which the Heroic team don't control.</p>
<p>Here's all the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Games Support</li>
<li>GPTK support</li>
<li>DRM support for browser apps</li>
<li>ProtonDB &amp; Steam Deck compatibility on game page</li>
<li>Playtime tracking for GOG</li>
<li>Possibility to disable log files</li>
<li>Installing older DXVK on older hardware</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Epic Games accounts will no longer get logged out when launching Heroic sometimes</li>
<li>GOG games will now remember their install path correctly</li>
<li>GOG "Goodies" will now redirect users to their GOG account</li>
<li>Checking "Download games without HTTPS" in the advanced settings works again</li>
<li>Popover ("Help") menus in the settings now correctly open</li>
<li>"Report a problem running this game" instructions were updated</li>
<li>Linux: Using the Steam Runtime inside Flatpak now works</li>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver 525.47.34 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released another update to their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta driver</a> series with 525.47.34 out now. So here's what's new and fixed.</p>
<p>Quite a small one this time just hooking up two new extensions, and a performance improvement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_host_image_copy.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_host_image_copy</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Improve performance of vkCmdBeginRendering/vkCmdEndRendering</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>This is their special developer-focused driver series. For those who need all the very latest Vulkan work. For gaming and normal users, you practically always want to just stick with their mainline drivers. Although, at times, these Vulkan Beta drivers do get extensions needed first for newer Proton / DXVK / VKD3D-Proton features. The latest mainline driver is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/nvidia-driver-535-86-05-out-now-linux/" target="_blank">535.86.05 from July 18th</a>.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular you're waiting on to be implemented in NVIDIA's drivers?</p>

      <title>Tencent to get a majority stake in Dying Light dev Techland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a bit of industry news for you. Techland, developer of Dying Light, have <a href="https://techland.net/news/techlands-next-chapter-and-the-road-ahead" target="_blank">announced</a> some "exciting news" about the future of their studio.</p>
<p>After the usual PR talk about wanting the best for the studio, Techland CEO Pawel Marchewka dropped word that Tencent are going to be acquiring a "majority shareholder". Marchewka went onto mention the deal will allow them to "move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games" and that they will retain full ownership of their IPs and maintain creative freedom.</p>
<p>Because we all enjoy game industry consolidation right? What could possibly go wrong with all these big groups swallowing up publishers and developers? There's Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/microsoft-wins-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank">grabbing Activision Blizzard</a>, Embracer eating up everything they can and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">then closing a bunch</a> and of course Tencent back again with more.</p>
<p>Tencent have invested into (and in some cases fully own) the likes of Riot Games, Epic Games, Turtle Rock Studios, Funcom, Bloober Team, Don't Nod, FromSoftware and plenty more.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Xenonauts 2 is looking good on desktop Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The invasion continues. Xenonauts 2 is now in Early Access from Goldhawk Interactive and Hooded Horse and I've taken a look to see how it runs on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>With the good news to begin - it works out of the box on both with Proton 8. No special Linux / Proton issues I've noticed when playing it. So if you're into XCOM-like strategy games, and this is very XCOM, then you're in for quite a treat, keeping in mind there will be bugs and balancing issues since it's an Early Access game.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck specifically, playing it is a little more difficult since it does not have full controller support. So you'll be using Steam Input's keyboard / mouse layout and it may take a few minutes to tweak it to your liking. Not a big issue though, and felt good enough with the Steam Deck's trackpads but actual controller support would make it just so much better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7776788271690218101gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7776788271690218101gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16987035071690218102gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16987035071690218102gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Pictured - Xenonauts 2 on Steam Deck. Click them to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>As for graphics settings on Steam Deck, I would suggest just sticking to the "Fast" preset with a 40Hz / FPS lock in the Steam Deck performance menu and you're pretty golden there. Not much is needed apart from that because it runs really nicely with those together overall. It's also turn-based so any drops I saw were momentary and not a problem for the gameplay.</p>
<p>Text size is once <em>again</em> an issue though. It’s not exactly heavy on the text, but there are times you get a few paragraphs to read based on mission reports and what’s going on. On Steam Deck the text size simply isn’t big enough to be comfortable to read. So it really needs the developer to adjust it and add in some actual scaling options.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux with my Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti it's no surprise that it handles max settings without breaking a sweat. No performance issues there at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1279342951690212435gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1279342951690212435gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Xenonauts 2 on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>So what's actually different compared with the original? The developer has been <a href="https://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/index.php?/topic/34952-what-are-the-differences-between-xenonauts-1-and-xenonauts-2/" target="_blank">keeping a list</a> and there's actually quite a lot. This includes more difficulty options, a proper tutorial, extensive tooltips, translation support, a better user interface with improved text clarity, Steam Achievements, better support for ultrawide displays, it's now using a modern 3D game engine (Unity), a number a new mission types and the list goes on.</p>
<p>For those who haven't played the first one, it's a lot more like the classic X-COM: UFO Defense / UFO: Enemy Unknown compared with the modern XCOM remakes. Think of it like an evolution of the 90s original, one that's quite a lot more tactical and a thorough challenge. You build various bases across the globe, and equip each one with buildings, troops and more to deal with an expanding alien threat. You need multiple bases too, as each has a limited area they can scan around them for UFOs.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="putzWEnR7J0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/31e246cd43822932a2944d19ebbf3ccb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/putzWEnR7J0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Bringing back some great memories of when I played X-COM: UFO Defense / UFO: Enemy Unknown on the Amiga. The excitement of discovery and the panic of a UFO being spotted that you need to chase down. There's a lot of interesting mechanics at play here with lots of enemy types, human agents working alongside them and all the mystery surrounding it keeps it feeling fun as you go through. Really it feels <em>exactly</em> like what I would want from a modern strategy game inspired by one of the best retro strategy games ever made (I'll fight anyone who thinks X-COM isn't an all-time great).</p>
<p><em>It does feel a little bit special playing a game inspired by a childhood favourite right in my hands on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Some of it really can be difficult, although a lot of it really does depend on your own decisions. In my first mission for example, I lost half my squad pretty quickly due to poor positioning. A small element of it is also the accuracy system, which as any XCOM player would know a "99%" hit chance right in their face can still result in you missing a shot and losing a soldier. There's missions where enemies will repeatedly get reinforcements too, making your positioning and timing all that more important.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10727932921690218148gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10727932921690218148gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Xenonauts 2 on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>The UI work done in it actually reminds me a <em>little</em> of the more modern Paradox games like Crusader Kings III, with nested pop-ups, links in text to hover that can bring up more information and other little adjustments. It's looking pretty good and thankfully laid out quite nicely so there's not a chance of getting lost in the UI.</p>
<p>So far I've been really impressed with it and look forward to seeing what development during Early Access brings. The developer has been actively fixing up issues as they come on, and responding to some comments about the (at times) punishing difficulty in some mission types with more difficulty options planned to be added in.</p>
<p>A little rough around the edges as expected but once complete, I can easily see this being one of the best strategy games to pick up and play. They're estimating around 9 months until the game leaves Early Access.</p>

      <title>Airships: Conquer the Skies gets a DLC adding in captains and governors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you played Airships: Conquer the Skies? It's a game about building fearsome airships and land vehicles to give you the edge in massive aerial battles.</p>
<p>It's a great game with full Native Linux support and it just got a big DLC with Airships: Heroes and Villains. This new DLC expands the game with captains that improve ship performance and give you abilities to turn the tide of battle. While it also adds in governors you can assign to cities to help reduce unrest and increase productivity. </p>
<p>As the developer explains: "Captains and governors react to events and your actions. A peace-loving governor may quit if he sees you commit one too many war crimes, whereas a researcher can gain experience from dissecting the monsters you kill. As time goes on they can change - for better or worse - and a few of them can become famous enough to re-unite the warring city-states, providing a new path to victory." </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WNErufrgWsk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49d8d705b271a0853897a6f1f31c3579.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WNErufrgWsk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall the game has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam and it's also Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>You can buy the game from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/airships-conquer-the-skies?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/airships_conquer_the_skies" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://zarkonnen.itch.io/airships" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/342560/Airships_Conquer_the_Skies/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Morrowind engine replacement OpenMW v0.48 out now with shaders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing with it some pretty fancy new features, the Morrowind engine replacement OpenMW version 0.48.0 is out now. An exciting release for bringing some modern stuff to this RPG classic.</p>
<p>One of the biggest additions is support for post-processing shaders giving plenty of new eye-candy and various advanced visual effects like bloom, godrays, ambient occlusion, and many more. There's also a new menu on F2, letting you toggle effects easily.</p>
<p>There's also much better looking fog, a visual overhaul of rain ripples, soft particles were implemented, a bunch of improved animations for blocking and spellcasting, big improvements to the sound-system so sounds fade instead of cutting out when moving away, various UI improvements, a data directory section in the launcher for easier modding, font settings in the launcher and lots of other tweaks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/210920021690194259gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/210920021690194259gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMW on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>Another major addition is the introduction of their own Lua scripting API named OpenMW-Lua. This was built with eventually supporting multiplayer and reaching parity with MWSE (Morrowind Script Extender) but will not work with normal MWSE-Lua mods because OpenMW is quite different behind the scenes. Future releases of it will continue to expand what it can do, so eventually OpenMW really will be <em>the</em> place for everything Morrowind.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://openmw.org/2023/openmw-0-48-0-released/" target="_blank">full release blog post</a> for more.</p>
<p>Want to set it up on Steam Deck? It's pretty easy as I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">covered in a previous guide</a>.</p>

      <title>ΔV: Rings of Saturn is a game for real space nerds - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ΔV: Rings of Saturn from developer Kodera Software is a physics-based hard-science mining sim, and the 1.0 release is out now. It comes with full Native Linux support and it runs quite well on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, this is a game for real true space nerds. Our contributor scaine was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/11/checking-up-on-the-latest-huge-updates-to-sci-fi-mining-game-rings-of-saturn/" target="_blank">quite a fan</a> of it when taking a look back in late 2019 and since then the game has only gotten much bigger and better. You can also see a previous brief <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/an-interview-with-kodera-software-creator-of-the-hard-sci-fi-dv-rings-of-saturn/" target="_blank">interview I did with the developer here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a game all about mining asteroids and there's no fancy lasers or hyper-drives to be found, instead it focuses on real science as they say all the "technologies are real and there is no technobabble". There's a lot of seriously clever touches to the game although it can feel a bit daunting to get into. An initial struggle is quite worth it though, because it's a thoroughly interesting game to just go do some space exploring and mining.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qoykm2x2WDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e95f502349c58b76055e920817358b3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qoykm2x2WDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been enjoying the peaceful loneliness of it. A fair amount of time is just you swinging your ship around, flying around and doing some mining and with all the space science going on — it certainly looks and feels the part if you're into games that don't hold your hand. The initial tutorial is somewhat brief but a reasonable crash course in the main flying mechanics. After that though, you're largely left to your own devices to play it how you wish.</p>
<p>Honestly can't tell you the joy I felt hearing my LIDAR beeping away due to an escape pod floating around near me. So I speedily went to grab it, completely overshooting it of course because the thrusters will make you just keep on going and I was getting a bit ahead of myself. Trouble is, another ship was also closing in on me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13118572761689966740gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13118572761689966740gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10864036011689967492gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10864036011689967492gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This other ship was seemingly trying to harass me, giving me little thruster nudges and generally being a nuisance. My first attempt to grab the escape pod was thwarted by a mixture of me not lining up my ship to the correct orientation to pull it in, and that damn AI ship pestering me. I've no idea what they were really trying to do, I assume also trying to grab the pod but it's mine now.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with the game is the constant beeping. It's <em>supposed</em> to be helpful, pointing you towards things but I personally found it confusing, unhelpful most of the time and quite distracting, especially when you're just trying to learn the ropes and it's just <em>beeping</em> at you. It could have done with some clearer walk-through on the beeps and how to adjust them.</p>
<p>Apart from that though, ΔV: Rings of Saturn is an easy game to get utterly lost in for hours. Go check it out.</p>

      <title>AI-powered news sites are dumb and Redditors managed to trick them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is pretty amusing to see. Nothing really related to Linux / Steam Deck gaming, but more a state of the industry post that I thought you might also find fun. Redditors managed to trick an AI-powered news scraper.</p>
<p>AI powered news is something that is (annoyingly) going to become more common, whether we like it or not. Many bigger publishers are making moves into AI written articles. The problem is, "AI" is <em>dumb</em> and the articles are always full of errors or in this case — posting about something completely made up.</p>
<p>Redditors played a bit of an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/154umm2/im_so_excited_they_finally_introduced_glorbo/" target="_blank">internet joke</a> getting hyped over a fake announcement for World of Warcraft adding in the "Glorbo". The post titled "I’m so excited they finally introduced Glorbo!!!" reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, this new feature makes me so happy! I just really want some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this.</p>
<p>I have to say, since they started hinting at it in Hearthstone in 1994, it was obvious that they would introduce Glorbo to World of Warcraft sooner or later. I feel like Dragonflight has been win after win so far, like when they brought back Chen Stormstout as the end boss of the new Karazhan? Absolutely amazing!</p>
<p>Feel free to comment below what features and stories you want to see in the future! Maybe you’ll be quoted on some trustworthy news websites as well!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That same day a website named "The Portal" scraped it, ran it through their silly "AI" processor and published an article about it, even including quotes from the user above about hoping "some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this". <span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">They've since removed it but you can see it thanks to the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230720233444/https://www.zleague.gg/theportal/world-of-warcraft-wow-players-excited-for-glorbos-introduction/" style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); font-size:16px" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4701419831689961926gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Even funnier, is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230720145940/https://www.zleague.gg/theportal/world-of-warcraft-wow-players-react-to-ai-generated-content-on-popular-gaming-sites/" target="_blank">same website</a> then also did an article noting "World of Warcraft (WoW) players are expressing their frustration with popular gaming sites that appear to be using AI to scrape content from their subreddit". AI article bots causing a nice self-own there.</p>
<p>A growing problem that will no doubt continue to get worse. You've all seen just how terrible the likes of Google search is now right? It's thanks to AI, constant clickbait farms hammering SEO techniques to become the top result and all sorts of trickery. Search engines are a <em>mess</em> now.</p>
<p>Why do websites do it? Pretty simple really: the more they publish about big-name stuff, the more they could rank up in search engines, get people to click to them and get advert revenue. </p>
<p><em>One thing is for sure, you won't see any AI written stuff here. I may not be the best writer but at least I'm real…last I checked.</em></p>

It also comes with some slide-over silicone grips for the sides of the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>FACEMINER is a retro dystopian narrative-driven A.I. management sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to go back to the 90s? Keep an eye on FACEMINER, a simulation game about AI, surveillance and mass biometric data harvesting set in 1999.</p>
<p>Set against a backdrop of 90s techno-optimism, FACEMINER is an experimental, narrative-driven management sim that tasks the player with building a planetary scale biometric processing empire from scratch. All from within a suite of vintage software. The developer emailed to mention it will have full Native Linux support at release.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ntnYoBBsq14"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e87ee04eed8355c1c797d4d815dde85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ntnYoBBsq14" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Detailed simulation of data centre operations; manage RAM, processing power, memory, cooling systems, software upgrades and more.</li>
<li>Keep track of the office gossip — and reveal the story of FACEMINER — through the lively internal messaging system.</li>
<li>Visualise your data center in 3D with the state-of-the-art (for 1999) ‘Visualiser’ tool.</li>
<li>Set within a painstakingly crafted tribute to everybody’s favourite vintage operating system.</li>
<li>Soundtrack comprised of true-to-period MIDI, dug up and restored from the deepest recesses of the internet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From what the developer explained about it: "FACEMINER is the result of a research project examining the ecological impact of planetary-scale cloud computing, particularly when used for training AI models. The game incorporates exponential growth as a game mechanic to highlight the winner-takes-all nature of cloud computing, where datasets and the server farms housing them grow dramatically year-on-year in both their size and value.</p>
<p>The game is an exploration of how the simulation game format can be used to simplify a complex topic that covers surveillance, AI, and the deployment of physical infrastructure at extreme scales. The digital landscapes where these technologies are constructed, and the virtual clouds from which they are deployed, often obscure their connection to the physical realities of raw computational power. FACEMINER is an attempt to make these connections feel tangible."</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-7 released bringing back AMD FSR support (UPDATED)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 24/07/23</strong>: GE-Proton 8-8 and GE-Proton 8-9 were released shortly after as hot-fixes to clean up some problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is a minor hotfix release that just syncs proton-wine and dxvk with upstream versions from today. A user complained they were seeing some odd CPU+GPU usage in 8-7 but was fine in today's proton-experimental. After testing with this build based on today's experimental they confirmed it was working here too.</li>
<li>Hotfix: Apparently yesterdays build was missing the normal proton packaged Gecko and Mono (the file size was significantly smaller than usual). This build fixes that.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>The compatibility layer GE-Proton <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-7" target="_blank">version 8-7</a> has been released, bringing with it the return of AMD FSR support. This is more useful for desktop Linux (or desktop mode on Steam Deck), since the Steam Deck's main Gaming Mode has AMD FSR built into the performance options.</p>
<p>With support back it allows you to use AMD FSR 1 on top of any Vulkan game (or DXVK / VKD3D-Proton) running through GE-Proton. It's on by default and set to "balanced", you just need to set in-game resolution lower than your monitor and have it be in fullscreen mode. Showing the power of open source, the needed work to upgrade the AMD FSR patches was done by developer <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/pull/91" target="_blank">Ph42oN</a>. You can change the settings using launch options noted on the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (scroll down).</p>
<p>In addition to bringing back AMD FSR support here's the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>protonfix for Oceanhorn removed as it's no longer needed (thanks Iglu47)</li>
<li>protonfixes added for Neptunia Re;Birth 1 &amp; 2 (thanks NishiyamaPedro)</li>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest git</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>dxvk-nvapi updated to latest git</li>
<li>upstream build changes pulled in</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Reminder: GE-Proton is made by the community, it's completely separate to the official Proton from Valve.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download

      <title>Voxel Doom II releasing August 1st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for more retro action? Voxel Doom II (a mod made with <a href="https://zdoom.org" target="_blank">GZDoom</a>) is releasing August 1st, giving you fully 3D voxel-based models for a second helping of Doom. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/voxel-doom-brings-voxel-goodness-to-the-original-doom/" target="_blank">The first one</a> was quite a highlight for the Doom modding community and Voxel Doom II looks like plenty more of the same goodness.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IQK8m41daAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7645572cd55829ca521f532740d5760.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IQK8m41daAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A nice mod that will preserve the original gameplay but just give it a little kick with some better models. The Doom games are classics and don't always need to be stuffed full of expansive mods right? Sometimes you just want tweaked simplicity. Not that the work that goes into making these models is simple.</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go?</p>
<p>You'll need a copy of Doom II for the WAD files that you can grab easily on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a>. The mod pack itself will likely be up on Mod DB when released.</p>

      <title>Roguelite shooter Arcadegeddon hits Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Arcadegeddon arrived on Steam recently from IllFonic after being an Epic Exclusive. It's flashy ever-evolving co-op roguelite shooter and the developers plan to ensure it stays compatible with Linux / Steam Deck. <em>Note: the developer provided a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ever-evolving co-op multiplayer, roguelite shooter allows you and up to 3 friends to explore multiple biomes, compete in mini games, find hidden chests, and battle a crazy cast of enemies and bosses. Arcadegeddon lets you play at your own pace with its mix of PVE and PVP gameplay. Speed into the action or take it slow, it’s up to you. As you get to know the town, you can dive into additional challenges from the local gangs that hangout in Gilly’s Arcade, earning you much more than just street cred. Though, the view from the top of the leaderboards must be pretty darn good...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curiously, I have been unable to get it to launch on desktop Linux (Fedora KDE 38) so I've <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6941" target="_blank">logged a bug with Valve</a> on the Proton GitHub. Testing Proton 7, 8 and Experimental all gave me the same problem. However, it is "Steam Deck Playable" and it does actually launch properly on Deck with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Feels like a weird but entertaining mash-up between Fortnite in style, Borderlands in lots of the mechanics and plenty of its own spice. If you like co-op shooters so far it seems really great. Keeping it on the Medium graphics preset, with a 40Hz / 40 FPS lock so far seems like a good fit between performance and graphics while feeling good on the controls.</p>

Click pics to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>I asked the developers about Linux / Steam Deck support for the game, in regards to anti-cheat since it does have an online focus (although you can play solo) and they said this:</p>
<p>"We have some of our own anti-cheat technology in place to protect against common ways of cheating/hacking. Without getting too far into the details, there are some systems to prevent memory modification and network traffic parsing. We are also server authoritative in multiplayer on dedicated servers. Our current in-house solutions were implemented with Steam Deck in mind, at the time there were not many options. Any future anti-cheat features or systems added will absolutely be implemented on Steam Deck as a requirement. We take our player reporting very seriously and hate to see anyone ruin the fun for the masses which is why we continuously do all we can to put a stop to cheating."</p>
<p>So there you have it. Great to hear they will ensure it continues working.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1515640/Arcadegeddon/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Wandering Village gets a big Ocean Update and you can win a key</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village is a wonderful city-builder where you're building on the back of a massive creature. Currently in Early Access, Stray Fawn Studio just released a big watery upgrade. With Native Linux support and a Steam Deck Verified status, it's an easy choice to recommend from my own time spent enjoying the idea.</p>
<p>With the Ocean Update out now it's added a whole new biome to wander through, building upgrades, new decorations, a hostility modifier system, new buildings, new events, new locations and much more. Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZLEiCdtpCbc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6abb21e35900fa2780f9c153ceeef77.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZLEiCdtpCbc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have a lot more planned to add into the game including new biomes, improved villager AI and an improved happiness system, flying merchants to trade with, birds you can tame, more buildings, more events, more locations and the list goes on. Lots of good systems in place they can keep expanding on so I'm keen to see how much more they add in but it's already a really fantastic combination.</p>
<p>Want to <strong>win</strong> a key? The developer kindly gave two to give away. To enter just leave a comment to say why you wish to win a copy of this game. Giveaway closes 9PM BST, Monday - July 24th.</p>
<p>If you wish to grab it now it's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/" target="_blank">25% off on Steam</a> until July 27th.</p>

      <title>Starfox meets Vampire Survivors - Whisker Squadron: Survivor out August 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's certainly one way to describe it. Whisker Squadron: Survivor is styled very much like the classic rail shooter Starfox but sprinkles in some elements popularised by Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>I've been testing out the game for a little while, very much impressed by what I've seen from it. For anyone who likes retro styled 3D shooters like this you're definitely in for a bit of a treat. The developers, Flippfly LLC, have now announced that it will enter Early Access on August 21st and this is with full Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The developer mentions that "you'll have a robust set of loadout choices for each run including pilot, ship, primary guns and missiles, each with unique gameplay attributes. During a run, the randomized upgrades include a mix of stat modifiers, passive abilities and attacks, and each run can play out in really unique ways".</p>
<p>Check out their new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_5Z6kYdF2P0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8b22114f1fbcb5b3064ad73439c25d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_5Z6kYdF2P0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embark on an ever-changing adventure across neon-laced roguelike levels featuring on-rails shooter runs that change with every 20-30 minute playthrough.</li>
<li>Design a fighter ship using randomized upgrades that can be built using scraps dropped throughout each level and Victory Points earned through play.</li>
<li>Change the way your runs play out by unlocking mods as you earn achievements.</li>
<li>Discover portals that will send you on a new and challenging secret path that will change the way you approach your run.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's actually an off-shoot of another shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303400/Whisker_Squadron/" target="_blank">Whisker Squadron</a>, which will be launching sometime in 2024. </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140100/Whisker_Squadron_Survivor/" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a> and there's a demo available.</p>

      <title>Keep an eye on Parkour Legends inspired by Olli Olli, Super Meat Boy and Celeste</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love fast-paced challenges? Enter Grip are working on Parkour Legends, a fast-paced side-scrolling parkour platformer and it looks like a lot of fun. It will be available with full Native Linux support, and the developer told me via email they've been making sure it runs great on the Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>Blending together elements of Olli Olli, Super Meat Boy and Celeste it gives you all the stunts and tricks you might find in a skateboarding game but with parkour platforming. It's not an endless-runner though, with everything being hand-crafted by the developer with you having full character control.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fun idea. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="og0e9nuAz2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db976a6f2d0e9b28e4df5ffb541ddf3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/og0e9nuAz2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Sprint, slide, roll, rebound, grab onto ledges, and run across walls</li>
<li>Kongs, tic tacs, lazy vaults. You name it. We got it.</li>
<li>Build up adrenaline with risky moves to get higher scores</li>
<li>Put your skills to the ultimate test with 250+ hand-crafted levels across multiple zones + hard modes for every level</li>

      <title>Dolphin Emulator devs give up on Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After all the ruckus recently about the Dolphin Emulator for Wii and GameCube coming to Steam, and then being blocked - the team has now <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/07/20/what-happened-to-dolphin-on-steam/" target="_blank">given up</a> with the Steam release.</p>
<p>They remained pretty silent on it since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/nintendo-blocked-dolphin-emulator-release-on-steam/" target="_blank">initial announcement</a>, which caused a lot of speculation and confusion but now they're explaining their side and how they feel about it going forward after seeking legal advice. The good news, is that nothing is going to happen to Dolphin and development sounds like it's just continuing as normal. It's just not able to have a release on Steam since Nintendo asked Valve not to allow it on the store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, after a long stay of silence, we have a difficult announcement to make. We are abandoning our efforts to release Dolphin on Steam. Valve ultimately runs the store and can set any condition they wish for software to appear on it. But given Nintendo's long-held stance on emulation, we find Valve's requirement for us to get approval from Nintendo for a Steam release to be impossible. Unfortunately, that's that. But there are some more serious matters to discuss, some that are much bigger than Dolphin's Steam Release.</p>
<cite>Dolphin Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>The big issue surrounds the inclusion of the Wii Common Key, which is required for the emulator to be able to run Wii games, which they said has been in their code for around 15 years without an issue.</p>
<p>The Dolphin team claim a lot of "armchair lawyers" talked about how foolish they have been for including it but they said "now that we have done our homework and talked to a lawyer, we are no longer concerned". They have no plans to remove it, as after getting legal advice they believe there's no issue since Dolphin itself is "not primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection".</p>
<p>After news about it spread around they claim they had "many requests, and even some demands, to remove all Wii keys from our codebase" but they don't think it matters and they think if they removed it and then relied on 3rd party applications it would "make the situation worse for everyone". Their message to the "armchair lawyers":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And to all the armchair lawyers out there, the letter to Valve did not make any claims that we were violating a US copyright by including the Wii Common Key, as a <em>short string of entirely random letters and numbers generated by a machine</em> <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf" target="_blank">is not copyrightable</a> under current US copyright law. If that ever changes, the world will be far too busy to think about emulation.</p>
<cite>Dolphin Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>Not only will development carry on as normal, so you'll just need to grab Dolphin as you always have done from elsewhere, but some elements from the Steam release will still be continued like the big screen interface that can be used directly with a gamepad. </p>

      <title>Gravity Circuit released paying tribute to classic platformers like Mega Man</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gravity Circuit, a side-scrolling platformer that turns the action up to 11 and builds upon the legacy of popular console titles from the 1980s and 1990s has been released, and it has a native Linux version.</p>
<p>Released on July 13th by developer Domesticated Ant Games and publisher PID Games, Gravity Circuit sees the player guiding Kai, an upgradeable robotic war-veteran who is the user of the titular Gravity Circuit, as he seeks to take down the evil Virus Army and put a stop to their attempt at world-domination.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zj2SqGVQVdg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cebbcd28551f217ec3e0e88710d25b9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zj2SqGVQVdg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Set in a future world populated by sentient robots, the game wears its inspirations on its sleeve and that's no bad thing, as it looks like a very slick reimagining of classic 1990s console platformers such as Capcom's Mega Man X, but with an even quicker pace and much more acrobatic movement. It seems to be finding favour with fans, too, with all reviews on Steam currently sitting at Very Positive within a week of release.</p>
<p>The official write-up provides more information;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gravity Circuit</strong> - a flashy action packed 2d platformer in the spirit of console classics.</p>
<p><u>Mission: Stop the Virus Army’s Uprising!</u><br/>
In a futuristic world populated by sentient robots, its inhabitants are once more threatened by an old foe, the Virus Army. Defeated decades ago, it has re-emerged from the shadows with a unique goal, complete world domination. Severely weakened Guardian Corps are left with no other choice but to call upon a hero of the previous war: the lone operative, Kai, who harnesses the powers of the mysterious Gravity Circuit. As the world's last line of defense, journey through futuristic environments, and take down the evil mastermind behind this chaos.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of classic platformers from the 80s and 90s, with action dialed to maximum, channel your power into your fists and send foes flying, or grapple them to get up close and personal. In your quest you will acquire many new powers, which will allow you to go even further beyond!</p>
<ul>
<li>Action packed platforming</li>
</ul>
<p>By channeling your energy into devastating punches, perform satisfying combos and send foes flying, causing destruction and mayhem in the process!</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the innocent, and power up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Stages are packed with secrets and innocent civilians alike. Uncover and rescue them, and unlock new powers!</p>
<ul>
<li>Single player campaign with 12 stages</li>
</ul>
<p>Each with their unique set of mechanics, your platforming and combat skills will be tested against an armada of enemies and bosses!</p>
<p>Gravity Circuit is in active development by a small and dedicated core team. You can follow the game's development via <a href="https://twitter.com/GravityCircuit" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 heads to Steam making it even easier on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally. One less extra launcher to become a nuisance? Blizzard games are finally coming to Steam with Overwatch 2 set to be the first on August 10th. Perhaps then it's no surprise Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/proton-experimental-brings-fixes-for-gears-5-overwatch-2-phasmophobia/" target="_blank">fixed up an issue with Overwatch 2</a> in Proton Experimental for Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/blizzard/23982127/overwatch-2-coming-to-steam-on-august-10" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“It’s our goal at Blizzard to listen to players and try to exceed their expectations in everything we do,” said Mike Ybarra, President of Blizzard Entertainment. “While Battle.net remains a priority for us now and into the future, we’ve heard players want the choice of Steam for a selection of our games, starting with Overwatch 2 on August 10th. We’re happy to work with Valve to make that happen.”</p>
<p>"Gamers and developers are both going to benefit from Overwatch 2 coming to Steam," said Gabe Newell, Valve's president. "Gamers will have another platform where they can play a beloved game that utilizes the capabilities of Steam, and developers will benefit from the effects of having the talented team at Blizzard helping us evolve our supported features and functionality for Overwatch 2."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4640536001689787420gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4640536001689787420gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Exciting times to be a gamer!</p>
<p>It's not clear what other Blizzard games will be coming or when, but I'll let you know when I know. For Overwatch 2 you will need to connect up a Battle.net account, which enables full cross-play too. Blizzard said playing on Steam will give you all the usual Steam features like Steam Achievements, Steam Friends integration and the ability to invite people into your game.</p>
<p>Looking over their recent financial results, they said pretty clearly that Overwatch 2 was seeing a decline in "engagement and player investment" but with a Steam release and the Overwatch 2: Invasion update coming, maybe they can turn it around.</p>

      <title>Roto Force is a rotating twin-stick bullet-hell and it&#39;s glorious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the need for a new game to pick up and play I can happily recommend Roto Force to you. A high-energy 2D twin-stick bullet-hell where you rotate around little arenas and it's just chaos.</p>
<p>The developer sent over a key and it works great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with full Native Linux support thanks to it being built with Java. Screenshots in no way do this game justice, you need to see it and feel it — pure fun. A fun twist on the bullet-hell genre, which I often find a lot of games are very samey but this thankfully feels new and fresh. Some good tunes to go along with it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14071910401689786668gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14071910401689786668gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You slide around the sides of each arena, and use your power to fling yourself across when you need to avoid fire, or pop through bubbles surrounding enemies and items. Plus you have an assortment of weapons, each with a unique type of fire - there's a lot to like in this one. Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Intel gives ASUS a license to carry on Intel NUC systems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After news recently from <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-exiting-the-pc-business-as-it-stops-investment-in-the-intel-nuc/" target="_blank">ServeTheHome</a> that Intel planned to stop doing their Intel NUC systems directly, they've now announced they've agreed to let ASUS carry it on.</p>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1634/intel-and-asus-agree-to-term-sheet-to-take-intel-nuc" target="_blank">press release</a> Intel stated ASUS now has a <em>non-exclusive</em> license to the Intel NUC product line designs, so they will now be manufacturing the 10th to 13th generation NUC systems. ASUS will also develop future designs and ASUS will establish a new unit called ASUS NUC BU to deal with it.</p>
<p>"Intel is pivoting its strategy to enable ecosystem partners to continue NUC systems product line innovation and growth. ASUS’s expertise and track record delivering industry-leading mini PCs to customers make it ideally suited to continue driving innovation and growth in NUC systems products." - Intel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16240982501689763070gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - Intel NUC 13 Pro</em></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what ASUS do with it, hopefully they won't suddenly inflate the pricing on it. With it being a non-exclusive license though, perhaps Intel are gearing up to announce more hardware vendors and we might see a little explosion in these tiny but powerful systems again?</p>

      <title>Portal: Prelude gets an NVIDIA RTX remaster, plus NVIDIA announced RTX IO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has announced another game to use NVIDIA RTX Remix to add in full Ray Tracing, this time it's a mod for the original Portal with Portal: Prelude RTX. Portal: Prelude is the highest rated mod for the original Portal and back in <a href="https://www.moddb.com/groups/2008-mod-of-the-year-awards/features/players-choice-best-released-mod" target="_blank">2008</a> it came number 3 on Mod DB's Mod of the Year contest. To play it free, you need to own the original Portal.</p>
<p>With the new refreshed Steam release it comes with Ray Tracing, DLSS3, Reflex and the newly launched NVIDIA RTX IO. The announcement also mentions it features "hundreds of new, fully upgraded materials and assets from David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm and Valerios “Fearell_Val” Tsoumpas, new voice acting by Jack “Amicus” McDade and Colin “SordidSpectacle” Zachariasen, and gameplay improvements from Nicolas".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zTf1YP6DV9E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9cba2ab310049265465a3121c266b75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zTf1YP6DV9E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Portal: Prelude RTX features</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nineteen challenging new test chambers</strong>, many improved from the original mod's release.</li>
<li><strong>A total graphical overhaul</strong> of the game's lighting and assets, powered by RTX Remix in partnership with NVIDIA.</li>
<li><strong>A cast of several fully-voice acted characters</strong> compared to the robotic voices of the original.</li>
<li><strong>A dramatic origin story</strong> for one of the most iconic villains and settings in gaming.</li>
<li><strong>An experience created by modders</strong>, helmed by modders, and released for fans of Portal to test their mettle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At least to make it run with my NVIDIA GPU with Proton I needed to use this as a launch option in the Properties menu for the game: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Otherwise the game wouldn't launch at all, so try that if you also see the same.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2410180/Portal_Prelude_RTX/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>NVIDIA continue upgrading RTX Remix too with full support for skinned characters. So now RTX Remix will allow modders "to add more than 100 times the polygonal detail to characters, in addition to high fidelity PBR textures, with minimal performance costs". There's various other RTX Remix improvements you can read <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/portal-prelude-rtx-available-now-for-free/" target="_blank">about here</a>.</p>
<p>Another big announcement is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-io-for-geforce-gpus-available-now/" target="_blank">NVIDIA RTX IO</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA RTX IO leverages the advanced architectures of GeForce GPUs to offload dozens of CPU cores’ worth of work to your GPU, enabling faster game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games. RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-1-1-coming-soon/" target="_blank">contributed by NVIDIA</a>, which is utilized by both Microsoft’s DirectStorage and new Vulkan Extensions.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Vulkan being properly supported with it. NVIDIA announced that RTX IO will also be in the upcoming Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart launching on July 26th.</p>

      <title>Valve adds ability to see Steam Deck verification in desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Steam Beta Client update for desktops, Valve has added a new option to let you view Steam Deck Verified status. Valve's changelog for desktop notes they added "a setting to display Steam Deck compatibility information in the library while not on a Steam Deck".</p>
<p>You can find it in Settings -&gt; Library at the bottom with a checkbox to turn it on:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18643179931689758236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18643179931689758236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When turned on, it will enable you to hover over any item in your Steam Library and see the Steam Deck Verified rating icon on the cover art as shown in the image below for Deep Rock Galactic. Hopefully they will add the option to just show it on them all without needing to roll your mouse around your entire library, they could definitely make that side of it more useful for users.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17499855341689758602gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17499855341689758602gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that, enabling the setting also shows it inside the main library page for each individual game like in the shot below, once again showing Deep Rock Galactic and you'll notice the Steam Deck Playable rating shown. However, to see this, you need to expand the details view with the information icon to the right of the page:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5819485651689758925gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5819485651689758925gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>See the full desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6245979991555027056" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck also had a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5520900450309020909" target="_blank">Beta update</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the wrong FPS limit could be applied on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the controller input thread could operate at normal instead of high scheduling priority.</li>
<li>Fixed styling on the login error screen and made the retry button accessible to the gamepad.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Library</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to sort by date added to library to shelves and game grids.<br/>
Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Developer console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a setting to display timestamps in the Steam console window.</li>
<li>Changed Steam console window to keep the last several seconds of output even if that would exceed the normal buffer length.</li>
<li>Fixed command echo sometimes appearing on the same line as the previous output.</li>
<li>Fixed clear_console command not doing anything.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The modular Framework Laptop 16 opens up for pre-orders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework have now put up the modular and customizable Framework Laptop 16 for pre-order featuring the latest AMD Ryzen CPUs and AMD Radeon GPUs. An exciting time to be a hardware fan because Framework do some great stuff.</p>
<p>They're again staggering the release with a batch order system though, so that they don't get completely overwhelmed. Ordering is open in US, Canada, Germany, France, UK, Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, and Australia with a refundable $100 deposit to grab a place in line.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441875861689705336gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441875861689705336gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds pretty awesome too: "We’re not only using AMD Ryzen™ and Radeon™ silicon, but we developed this product in close collaboration with AMD as part of the AMD Advantage program. We’re leveraging AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series processors, the latest generation that we also use in Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series), this time with HS-class parts optimized for gaming and creation. Configurations start with the Ryzen™ 7 7840HS with 8 Zen 4 CPU cores at up to 5.1GHz boost, and we also offer the totally overkill, top of the line Ryzen™ 9 7940HS with up to 5.2GHz boost. We worked with Cooler Master to design a thermal system with dual 75mm fans, three heatpipes, and a liquid metal thermal interface, enabling 45W continuous processor load while also keeping the laptop cool and quiet. There’s fantastic graphics performance built in too, with Radeon 780M graphics with 12 RDNA 3 cores, capable of running a range of modern game titles."</p>
<p>Even though it's pretty powerful out of the box with the basic components, they're also doing a dedicated Graphics Module for their Expansion Bay that allows you to add in an AMD Radeon RX 7700S GPU. They say they've maxed out what it can do to give you 100W sustained TGP and 8GB GDDR6 at up to 18Gbps. Not only that but the module has its own dedicated heatsink and higher CFM fans, so that the CPU and GPU can run at full wattage simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can see AMD's own video on it below as well:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L9Ww_7wwNkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a31f99a8cca8885c704ee81063d796e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L9Ww_7wwNkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It also comes with a 16 inch 165Hz 2560x1600 display with FreeSync, an 85Wh battery, more powerful "quad" speakers compared with their previous model 13, WiFI 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, a 1080p webcam with dual mics and hardware privacy switches and there's also a fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>Pricing starts at £1,399 for the DIY edition where you build it and £1,699 for pre-built.</p>
<p>They do regular Linux testing for their devices with both the 13 and new 16 working great with Linux. They've also previously sent out hardware to a few Linux developers as well. Some compatibility details can be <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/linux" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the mini Vampire Survivors documentary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a little more info on how Vampire Survivors came to be? The great people at Noclip have their next documentary up with the small team behind the absolute surprise smash-hit and it's well worth a watch.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is currently number 5 on the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a> best reviewed games of all time. Pretty incredibly really considering how simplistic a game it is overall, but that is of course part of the hook and charm of it. Noclip spoke with the original creator Luca Galante, who is quite a private person and didn't want to be on camera and so they made a fun Muppets-style Dracula puppet with Galante giving it a voice over. Quite a sweet and clever way to get around it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XQVdR8mJrds"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6bc1d9ad98b60ec4aefc593be39f55e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XQVdR8mJrds" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the interview Galante mentioned how moving from Italy to the UK was difficult, and the only job they could get initially was at McDonalds when their English wasn't very good. After 2 years they managed to improve their English and went for programming jobs - the first being Gambling related and eventually rising in the ranks at the company to a mid-level management position. From there, Galante started late-night working on games as a creative outlet after being fedup and wanting to make their own games. Eventually after getting the game ready and releasing on itch.io and going unnoticed, Galante released it on Steam and by luck a big YouTuber picked it up and things just exploded from there.</p>
<p>You can buy Vampire Survivors on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for £3.99 / $4.99.</p>

      <title>Cinematic 2D puzzle-platformer Full Void is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a dystopian future, Full Void from OutOfTheBit Ltd is out now with Native Linux support. It's a cinematic 2D puzzle-platformer telling the story of a young teenager alone in a hostile world controlled by a rogue AI. Fight your way through puzzles and obstacles to uncover the story that surrounds this broken, run down society, where only children are still free. But for how long?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g8QhWdWsjFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/395fbe1d1c6c81997d9b5adc44f157c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g8QhWdWsjFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: “After making fun arcade games such as Super Arcade Football and Super Arcade Racing, we really wanted to explore the puzzle platformer genre. With Full Void we wanted to tell a story and also convey a feeling to the player. It’s the feeling of helplessness and isolation many of us felt during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, and we tell this entire story without the use of words, except for a line of text on the very last screen of the game.”</p>
<p>The developers say that it should be suitable for most ages, as it has no gore or explicit violence as it was designed to provide a "thrilling atmosphere" above everything else that you can enjoy exploring and unravelling the story. Should work great on Steam Deck too which the developer teased in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsa2MUunliY" target="_blank">brief video</a>.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Environmental Storytelling;- Original, hand-drawn pixel art.</li>
<li>Interactive cut-scenes all hand drawn and animated.</li>
<li>Ability to hack machinery to solve puzzles.</li>
<li>Immersive and intense atmosphere.</li>
<li>Minimalistic sound design.</li>
<li>Compelling, Amiga MOD sounds.</li>
<li>Dynamic lighting.</li>
<li>Not too "retro-style" check points.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Exoprimal from Capcom tested on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capcom has now released Exoprimal, an online team-based shooter and thanks to Fanatical, I was able to take a look. Plus I have an <em>extra</em> discount on it for you.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am a Fanatical partner, but this is <em>not</em> sponsored in any way. Fanatical just randomly emailed me the key and a discount code. Being quite interested anyway, I decided to take a look. If you want you can <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/exoprimal?ref=gol" target="_blank">pick it up on Fanatical</a> and enter in the "<strong>GOL2OFF</strong>" code for some more monies off.</p>
<p>Now the good news - Exoprimal works out of the box with Proton 8 on Steam Deck and desktop Linux — it’s click and play. It does use Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services though but clearly Capcom have enabled the Linux and Steam Deck support as there's been no issues with online play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2690948071689611998gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2690948071689611998gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve have given Exoprimal a Steam Deck Playable rating, so it’s not fully Verified, as their notes mentioned it sometimes shows keyboard icons and some text can be a little small. In my own testing i can agree with the rating, as some of the text is a bit blurry and small. Once again we need games to have more text and interface scaling options. We’re not all playing directly in front of huge monitors or TVs. It also has black bars above and below as no 16:10 screen support.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re going to play it docked, you <em>may</em> need you to manually swap an external controller in the Steam Deck menu. Valve said it won’t pick it up as number 1 by default but it worked <em>fine</em> for me.</p>
<p>For the recommended graphics settings on Steam Deck, I would suggest going with Medium and just tweaking it a little to turn off things like Motion Blur and turn on Variable Rate Shading (in-game setting). However, this is mostly a 30-40FPS game, so I would suggest keeping your Steam Deck on a 40HZ and 40FPS lock in the Performance Menu because you’re not really often going to get above 40 and this just helps keep it a little bit smoother. Although, there absolutely will be drops <em>just</em> below 30FPS at the seriously intense times so it may just be better to lock it to 30. Even on lowest settings, those drops still happen, so you may as well keep some bits on Medium and enjoy the style more. A power-hungry sucker too, you’ll be lucky to get even 2 hours out of it on a single charge so bring your favourite powerbank.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x-cH2bSvvUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/455563ec5c14e6ec6a45f4210b2ab4ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x-cH2bSvvUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Desktop performance (Fedora KDE 38, NVIDIA 2080 Ti, Ryzen 5800X): on highest settings at 2560x1440, it kept a silky-smooth 60PS <em>almost</em> the entire time except for a few loading stutters that went away. I wasn't able to get it to go above 60FPS, as even turning off the frame lock didn't work for me with Proton. So not sure what's going on there.</p>
<p>What’s surprising here is that for a big new CAPCOM game, it doesn’t exactly have a lot of players, with it only seeing around 3-4,000 currently at a time. It also only has a Mostly Positive rating on Steam from players.</p>
<p>I had to wonder why but it doesn’t take long to figure out as there are some issues with it. For starters it’s a full-price £49.99 online game that requires a 3rd party Capcom account which was a real <em>nuisance</em> to set up initially and link to Steam, and there’s a whole bunch of DLC available from Day 1 - something that just feels a little icky for a brand new full price game to have. Then there’s all the skins too, and a lot of them aren’t even particularly interesting <em>and </em>a extra paid battle pass.</p>
<p>It’s also crammed full of cutscenes, so it takes quite some time to truly get into the game. There’s the tutorial and then the intro mission and those together take a good 40-50 minutes or so before you’re then actually <em>properly</em> at the main menu to really get started. Then after you do matches, there’s still more cutscenes as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>Aside from that though, it is actually a lot of fun and if you like these team-based action games like I do I think you’ll also have a good time with it either on Steam Deck or desktop Linux. I’m always on the lookout for new team games to play with others, and Exoprimal looks like it might fill quite a nice gap for me for a while after burning out on Deep Rock Galactic (which is excellent) but I played a bit too much of it so I’m taking a long break.</p>
<p>The action is pretty great overall though, often really quite intense and the ability to swap out your special powered Exosuit is a nice touch to deal with different situations to help you finish the missions. With each suit having their own specialised role between assault, tank and support with various abilities to help the team.</p>
<p>Here you have two squads that race to complete objectives, either in PvP where you fight at the end with the opposing team or just PvE where it’s just against the dinos. You also get to pick specifically between PvP, PvE or leave it on random for extra XP. So it’s nice to see they’re not forcing either side of the game on players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11850315211689612089gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11850315211689612089gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Exoprimal on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>The missions also change and expand based on your main level progression in the game, so the early game feels quite samey but as you do it a couple of times and level up and unlock more story stuff, it will sprinkle in some different mission types. This is one thing I think that will make people bounce off it, because of how limited the first around 2-3 hours feel.</p>
<p>Exoprimal is like a really weird blend of games here as it clearly takes inspiration from other team based games but I quite like what CAPCOM did with this, they’re at least trying to do something a little different blending in PvP and PvE together in the team-based action space with class-based characters that you can customize and upgrade.</p>
<p>The story is pretty ridiculous though, let’s be real here the setting with timelines is just ludicrous with powered suits versus dinos. Why not though right? We all love dinos and big guns too so why not blend them together in a game like this.</p>
<p>So the good news is that it works out of the box on Steam Deck and desktop Linux, and with only a few tweaks to the graphics settings for Steam Deck it does work <em>quite</em> well. However it definitely could do with some more optimizations for the lower end like the Steam Deck. The problem will be the player-base, with it being an online live service game with seasons. Can it actually keep people playing? Does it have enough to compete with the great many other online games? I actually <em>hope</em> so because it’s quite a nice easy game to sink some hours into that isn’t overly deep while still having some great action to keep you interested, and another good multiplayer game choice to pick up and play on Steam Deck and desktop Linux is always welcome.</p>
<p>Capcom has a good base here to expand upon and improve so I’m keen to see what they add into it over time. Lots of hours to play through as it is though so you’re not going to run out of content, level ups and upgrades any time soon.</p>
<p>I think really, the biggest problem they have is the price. Capcom are a big name, and they do make some great games, but an online shooter like this for full price, with the live service seasons and DLC? That’s what’s going to make or break it. It’s brainless fun but not the kind I would have personally seen myself pay out £49.99 ($60) for and I think that’s really why they’re not seeing big player counts with it. I personally think they made a bit of a mistake on the pricing and monetization here but that’s just my honest personal opinion. And because of that i won’t outright recommend it, i have definite <em>mixed</em> feelings about this one.</p>

      <title>Dave the Diver is a big beautiful blue gem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I’ve been playing through a game called Dave the Diver released on 28 Jun, 2023 from developer MINTROCKET. It seems to have taken Steam by storm with over 36,000 user reviews (and quickly growing!) giving it an overwhelmingly positive rating. After picking up a copy for myself and playing it, I can see why people love it so much.</p>
<p>Steam Deck Verified with Proton 7, it works pretty much to perfection with multiple hours of play on a single charge - I would say around 3 hours <em>without</em> any tweaks. It’s the perfect game to just pick up and play and sink a few hours into. There’s simply no need to dive into the settings on this one, a true click and play experience for anyone at home or on the go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14550365581689598325gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It also works great on desktop Linux too no problems there at all. Works exactly as expected. My testing there was on Fedora KDE 38 and all good. Performance is great and it looks fantastic.</p>
<p><em>So what is it?</em></p>
<p>Dave the Diver is an odd one to describe. You are Dave, and you’re going to do a lot of swimming around catching fish and all sorts of sea creatures. It’s a bit of a rogue-lite, with each time you dive into what they call the Blue Hole being a different layout with different fishies and loot to find. You have to watch your oxygen level, your depth and keep an eye out for nasty fishies that want to take a bite out of you. </p>
<p>You have a few different tools at your disposal to deal with the nasties though like your trusty harpoon, knives and shock sticks, a gun and more utilities you unlock as you progress though. There’s an upgrade system too, so you can keep making Dave just that little bit more useful.</p>
<p>I’ve been enjoying the carefully crafted progression system in this game, where you start off with basically nothing and it gradually sprinkles in more for you to do. It’s not just swimming around though, there’s also a sushi-bar restaurant mini-game where you’re gradually improving it and helping out delivering food and topping up peoples drinks. This is where you’ll actually make your money selling all your fish to then progress Dave as a character with the upgrades.</p>
<p>There’s a number of times it can feel like it gets a bit repetitive though, however, it doesn’t take long to start once again throwing a whole bunch of new stuff at you. The charm of the character interactions, the different missions types and the exploration just keeps Dave the Diver constantly shining and makes you just not want to put it down. The cut-scenes are delightful too, often quite comical as are the characters, it’s just such a real breath of fresh air in a big deep blue sea of games.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6WJVsJiaeFw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20a54d47d68117c70fd1cf7c6ee489e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6WJVsJiaeFw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Don’t be fooled by how <em>shallow</em> it feels at the start, because once you get a good few hours in there’s just so much to do that the initial repetitive loop fades away as you’re constantly doing various little jobs while swimming around from photography to mining, harpooning various types of fishies, opening chests, seahorse racing, there’s a collectible card game, lots of side-quests and it just keeps on throwing <em>more</em> at you. There’s even an underwater civilization! Dave the Diver has a little bit of <em>everything</em>. Seriously, you're never going to get bored with this one with the amount of content it is has it's pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Even the music is great, when swimming around it's the perfect match-up to keep you nice and relaxed after yet another fish got away or while you're being chased by sharks.</p>
<p>I’ve had such a wonderful time playing Dave the Diver, and I’m giving it a very firm recommendation for you to pick up too. A true shiny gem deserving a double thumbs-up from me. Easily one of the best more casual games I’ve played, heck it’s one of the best games this year by far. <em>Potentially</em> my game of the year.</p>
<p>Given how popular it is, I can easily imagine a lot of developers taking a look and getting some inspiration from it for their own games. </p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.2 is out now with app upgrades, artwork tweaks, login improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.2 is out now as the latest distribution built on top of Ubuntu, coming with various careful improvements to the base software included.</p>
<p>Available with Cinnamon 5.8 / MATE 1.26 / Xfce 4.18, a Linux kernel 5.15 and an Ubuntu 22.04 package base with a plan to receive security updates until 2027. Until 2024 they will continue to use the same Ubuntu package base, so upgrades will be "trivial" to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21465305991689588402gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21465305991689588402gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While it may not seem like the most exciting release, that mostly describes what Linux Mint do. They're not aiming to be the flashiest around as their aim is just to have a <em>good</em> desktop Linux distribution for everyone. For a quick highlight of some of what's improved in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touchpad improvements for login screen.</li>
<li>Multiple keyboard layouts for the login screen.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation improvements for the login screen.</li>
<li>Wayland session support on the login screen.</li>
<li>Software Manager got a UI refresh.</li>

<ul>
<li>Better performance, faster image loading, faster navigation</li>
<li>Support for AVIF/HEIF and JXL formats</li>
<li>Improved support for GIF, RAW and TIFF images</li>
<li>Improved zoom controls</li>
<li>+ lots more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artwork and theme improvements. Like Cinnamon 5.8 having a whole new desktop styling system.</li>
<li>XDG Desktop Portal support to XApp to provide better compatibility with Flatpaks and GNOME apps.</li>
<li>Dark Mode global setting.</li>
<li>Gesture support for window management, workspace management, tiling and media controls.</li>

      <title>FACEIT Anti-Cheat to support Linux / Steam Deck with BattleBit Remastered</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of BattleBit Remastered have now given a much more clear answer to what their plans are for their anti-cheat and it seems it's great news for gamers on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/battlebit-remastered-anti-cheat-for-steam-deck-linux-is-concerning/" target="_blank">detailed previously</a>, their communication on it has been a little bit confusing with some conflicting statements and just generally unclear plans. Now, they're giving it to us straight and it's quite interesting! This news comes from their latest developer video where they said:</p>
<p>"We will not use the FACEIT that exists today. Like the current FACEIT that CS:GO uses, we will not use <em>that</em> FACEIT. The developers are making a new anti-cheat. They are making a fresh new anti-cheat that is different to their original anti-cheat that will support Linux - Steam Deck OS, it will have less restrictions to what CS:GO has but at the same time it will still be effective. It won't be as effective as what CS:GO uses because obviously the restrictions are there to squeeze any possibility but working with their team we can squeeze a lot more than what we have right now. It will be a completely new anti-cheat that we will be the first user of, and it will definitely support the popular versions of Linux and Steam Deck OS. So if you have bought the game and if you were playing on Linux or Steam Deck OS - you don't have to worry about that it will still be supported and FACEIT will ensure it's supported. They will troubleshoot any case if you have problems there."</p>
<p><em>Side-note: to be clear normal CS:GO uses VAC. However, FACEIT have their own competitive side of CS:GO with FACEIT Anti-Cheat. They're two separate online communities.</em></p>
<p>Listen on from 11:42 for the full statement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nIay2Aq2ars?rel=0&amp;start=702"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02efdf68d76d672fbe7ef2f75116f04b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nIay2Aq2ars?rel=0&amp;start=702" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So that's good news for all fans of BattleBit Remastered, currently one of the most popular shooters available on Steam - it's not going to suddenly stop working. If it does, it's a bug and they should fix it.</p>
<p>Interesting though that they went from FACEIT to Easy Anti-Cheat, with plans to go back to FACEIT where they said they will also keep Easy Anti-Cheat but now they're working with FACEIT on a new anti-cheat that supports Linux. What a time to be a Linux gamer huh?</p>
<p>You can buy the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" target="_blank">game on Steam</a>. I also did a <a href="https://youtu.be/clioxu6BmAs" target="_blank">quick news video</a> on this.</p>

      <title>CodeWeavers blog about their Linux / Steam Deck work on Proton with PooShooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PooShooter: Toilet Invaders, yes it's a real game and we all had a bit of a chuckle when we saw Valve noted it fixed in a Proton changelog recently. CodeWeavers, Valve's partner on Proton development, have a blog post up talking about <em>why</em> it was interesting to solve.</p>
<p>As I've said in the past, fixing up issues even in tiny games can have a big effect elsewhere. It's not always the huge exciting flashy AAA names that need fixing, as problems affecting multiple titles can be hiding anywhere — even in a 2D game about a "Bum fighting against vengeful Toilets". <em>Side-note: writing this might be the highlight of my day, not many jobs get you to talk about a buttocks fighting toilets. I should talk about this the next time someone asks what I actually do…</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11465904851689346896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11465904851689346896gol1.jpg"/></a>Magnificent looking isn't it?</p>
<p>CodeWeavers' quality assurance team noted an issue with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/514390/PooShooter_Toilet_Invaders/" target="_blank">PooShooter: Toilet Invaders</a> having a black screen with Proton, although it reportedly worked with earlier versions. Things got weirder when they <em>couldn't</em> get it to work with any Proton version, even when they manually removed previous Proton files that might be sticking around. However, it did work when they used the "Delete Proton Files" option directly on Steam Deck in the developer menu.</p>
<p>Eventually they fixed the black screen rendering issue, which should also fix up some other titles <em>but</em> it also highlighted an issue with how the Delete Proton Files feature worked. As it turned out Valve had a bug in the Steam client where it <em>wasn't</em> removing files with filenames that had a colon (:) in them. Thanks to the work involved in fixing this tiny weird indie title, a bug that could have been causing numerous issues elsewhere was found — nice. It's also slightly hilarious that a game about bums and toilets, helped find an issue with a colon. Ah, simple pleasures. The jokes could write themselves at this point.</p>
<p>So the next time you need to clear some Proton files on Steam Deck just think - it's like flushing the toilet. Nice and clean.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2023/7/13/why-fixing-pooshooter-toilet-invaders-on-proton-was-definitely-not-a-waste" target="_blank">full blog post here</a>.</p>

      <title>Retro-inspired JRPG &#39;Alterium Shift&#39; enters Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your classic JRPG-likes? Alterium Shift is another good looking entry that recently entered Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support. Built with the Unity game engine as far as I can see, it works great on Fedora KDE 38. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Embark on a retro-inspired adventure with Alterium Shift, a classic JRPG featuring immersive 2.5D graphics and pixel art combined with modern gameplay. Choose from three unique characters, each with their own skills and elemental powers to explore the living world of Alteria. Engage in turn-based combat and fun mini-games like fishing as you uncover the secrets of this magical land and shape the outcome of the story with your choices."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UWQgUGNdqhk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/919100782b86e0f4db017674435496db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UWQgUGNdqhk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Alterium Shift is the result of our unwavering passion, reflected in the intricately crafted world, engrossing storyline, and immersive gameplay. I'm thrilled to invite you all into this world we've built and am eager to collaborate with our community to further enrich this extraordinary journey!"</p>
<p>They estimate Early Access will last until the end of 2023 or early 2024 depending on what they need to do - they say it's currently about 50% complete. Not sure how I feel about playing through such an RPG when it's not finished, but as always it's a chance for you to try and offer feedback to make it a better game in the end and ensure it works well on Linux.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586990/Alterium_Shift/" target="_blank">play it on Steam</a> and there's a demo available, with the full game having an option to skip the demo content if you've already done it.</p>

      <title>Cartridges game launcher adds support for Legendary for Epic Games and Flatpaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Cartridges? The simple launcher that aims to be a sort-of all in one solution, to bring together games from all of your sources. Well, it just had a nice upgrade.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/cartridges-is-another-linux-game-launcher-and-its-super-clean/" target="_blank">previous article only recently</a>, since then the 2.0 release went out adding in direct support for the Legendary tool for Epic Games, and it now supports Flatpaks as well to import games from. So you can now import games into it from Steam, Lutris, Heroic, Bottles, itch, Legendary and Flatpak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16677228001689334964gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16677228001689334964gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Could be quite useful to just have that one place to launch stuff from. Especially nice with its integration with SteamGridDB to give you nice looking cover art. Given how many launchers there are now, all with strengths and weaknesses (especially since some stores don't offer direct Linux support), perhaps having them all in one place will stop me forgetting everything I have installed.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://github.com/kra-mo/cartridges" target="_blank">out on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Try out the new demo of the upcoming JRPG inspired Quartet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following a success on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/somethingclassic/quartet-0/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, turn-based pixel-art JRPG inspired title Quartet now has a demo available with Native Linux support. The Kickstarter back in 2021 pulled in a nice $54,203 towards development so it's good to see some activity letting players experience a little of it.</p>
<p>About the game: A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The world’s unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic.</p>
<p>Their most recent video is a bit old but should give some insight into what they're doing with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kGJXR1rgleI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7391cd8bd1ef6c5ca54fd922afb35d62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kGJXR1rgleI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer also recently mention on their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1307960/discussions/0/3084382396886486568/#c3806154232469883930" target="_blank">Steam forum</a> they will "definitely have Linux (and SteamDeck) support at launch". Will be great to see another Kickstarted game release with the promised Linux support. It's due for a full release sometime in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307960/Quartet/" target="_blank">demo on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>New DLC info for retro-style beat-&#39;em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361510/view/3691311568763608103" target="_blank">More information</a> and a new trailer have been published for the recently-announced Dimension Shellshock DLC for the native Linux beat-'em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, revealing a new Survival Mode.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ioh0Cr1Lh7Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a47788ef2f8a15fd80be9eac749f239c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ioh0Cr1Lh7Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Players will be tasked with collecting crystals in order to progress through various alternate dimensions featuring increasing difficulty and new enemies that didn't appear in the main game - including an 8-bit one inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles titles created by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new power-up will make it possible to temporarily morph into and play as popular enemy characters such as Bebop and Rocksteady, and, of course, Shredder himself! This is in addition to the previously-announced playable character, Miyamoto Usagi. A number of non-playable cameos for fan-favourites from throughout the franchise's history have been confirmed, too.</p>
<p>From the official blurb;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This all-new game mode will radically change your in-game experience with travels across the multiverse, hordes of enemies to defeat and multiple rewards to earn. Each dimension will challenge you and allow you to get and bring new pixel-perfect vibes to your radical adventure with Leo, Donnie, Raph and Mikey.</p>
<p>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge - Dimension Shellshock DLC will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEW playable characters including Usagi</li>
<li>NEW game mode: SURVIVAL MODE</li>
<li>NEW flashy alternative color palette options</li>
<li>NEW bangers composed by the one and only Tee Lopes</li>
<li>NEW easter eggs to spot in-game and more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An in-depth 11-minute video with developer commentary is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is0vIkJP3pI" target="_blank">available on YouTube</a>.</p>

      <title>Factorio upgraded with controller support - now in the stable release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factory building and automation sim Factorio has a fresh stable release out, continuing years of free upgrades and it now has gamepad controller support. Becoming available first in the 1.1.83 experimental build that I wrote about previously, the developers continuing refining various bits in the game for a few more testing releases before pushing it out to everyone today.</p>
<p>The main differences from the last stable release to now include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added controller(gamepad) support. Change input method in Settings-&gt;Controls to play using a controller.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Minor Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added contextual hotkey hints. Enable it in Settings-&gt;Interface. Useful when playing using a controller.</li>
<li>When connecting wires to entities with multiple sides(combinator, power switch), the hovered side is highlighted.</li>
<li>Changed --dump-data to write infinite values as the string "inf" and "-inf".</li>
<li>It is now possible to blueprint entities of friendly forces.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated SDL to version 2.26.5.</li>
<li>Replace "Version" column in mods install menu with "Last highlighted"</li>
<li>Disabled the Command+W keyboard shortcut for closing the game window on Macs. Command+Q will still quit the application.</li>
<li>On macOS, left and right variants of the Command and Option keys are differentiated when not bound as a modifier.</li>
<li>Improved sounds fading in and out on game resume and pause.</li>
<li>Allow "Pick up items" and "Drop items" actions to be fired at the same time as other actions, in keyboard and mouse mode.</li>
<li>"Pick up items" will no longer fire at the same time as other actions. This fixes character picking up items when flipping blueprints.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So now if you're on Steam Deck or desktop, you can relax and kick-back a little easier with it. Since the game actually has all the binds set up, along with on-screen controller glyphs. Making one of the best indie games ever made much more accessible to people.</p>
<p>To enable it go into Settings -&gt; Controls and at the very top click the box for Controller. I previously tested it working great on Steam Deck and it also works just fine with an Xbox Series X pad on desktop Linux too:</p>

<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve - but that may need updating now.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine has a new funding platform and they&#39;re calling for help</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Godot Engine moving over to being supported by the Godot Foundation directly, they've begun pushing for people to support their efforts via their new funding platform inspired by Blender.</p>
<p>Part of the reason they're announcing this now is that when Godot was smaller it was gathering more funds than it could use as they couldn't find developers to hire. Now, everything around Godot has grown significantly but now they're at a level of spending greater than what they're pulling in.</p>
<p>Previously they used Patreon, PayPal donations and one-time grants but they're hoping to be more self-sufficient if they can get enough people to come to them directly. To give an example of where some funding goes, they current have 10 either part or full time contracted to work on Godot directly which is costing $40,000 per month.</p>
<p>They have numerous other expenses to cover as well including hardware, travel costs, future hires for work needed to improve Godot in specific areas and more.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">funding platform here</a> that notes they currently get €23,024 per month (around $25,794). However, they will be keeping their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine" target="_blank">Patreon</a> as right now they are relying on it but they hope to see future donations come direct so they have less fees.</p>
<p>Some other plans are in progress too like a paid asset store and merchandise.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/funding-breakdown-and-hiring-process/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu makes some big progress in the latest report</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The incredible team building the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu have a new progress report out for June 2023 and it's quite a doozy. Yes June, they're running over previous work. As usual, it's a lengthy read full of technical speak and exciting features and fixes so I'm here to summarise the important bits for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15993955401689263294gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15993955401689263294gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Picture above is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which now has <em>much</em> improved rendering thanks to all their working going into improving anisotropic filtering at higher values without rendering issues, improving image quality and it fixed up an old rendering bug for Mario Kart 8 too.</p>
<p>yuzu itself now ships with "virtually all" time zone data that the Switch has by default, so one less thing needed from a firmware dump.</p>
<p>They fixed a problem when "a memory page is being used by the GPU and written by the CPU at the same time" which solved various graphics bugs in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &amp; The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition and more games.</p>
<p>Improvements were also made for people with lower RAM, managing a "99.6% reduction" in RAM use for shader recompiling. Especially useful for people with 16GB or less RAM.</p>
<p>Games that use Unreal Engine 4 should no longer have broken textures with the Vulkan API (mostly an issue on NVIDIA), plus another improvement for UE4 games thanks to test the Pikmin 4 Demo that was crashing (and now solved).</p>
<p>One change that people with 4GB or lower VRAM might not appreciate is their Vulkan memory manager change. They adjusted it to "prefer (instead of require) using device local memory (VRAM) for image memory, which ends up allowing up to 50% of shared memory (system RAM) to be used by the GPU". This makes most UE4 games stable, but Tears of the Kingdom and other VRAM intense games may stutter more once VRAM gets close to full.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tears of the Kingdom, you can now safely upscale it higher without breaking the ambient occlusion effects.</p>
<p>OpenGL API rendering also saw some improvements, with the implementation of a local memory warmup shader for NVIDIA. They also extended persistent buffer maps from the texture cache to their buffer cache which they said "more than doubles the performance of OpenGL on NVIDIA hardware" and they said they expect to see similar results with Mesa on Linux too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17127999141689264254gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17127999141689264254gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>They still suggest Vulkan for being smoother but keeping up OpenGL improvements helps older hardware.</em></p>
<p>A Linux-specific fix was also implemented recently to hopefully prevent you needing to adjust the vm.max_map_count setting in your system for longer play sessions.</p>
<p>For the exact details head along to the <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-jun-2023/" target="_blank">yuzu blog post</a>. There's a lot more, I'm just cherry-picking some fun stuff.</p>

      <title>AMD opens up the FidelityFX SDK and it&#39;s now on GitHub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helping game developers integrate various AMD FidelityFX technologies into their games, AMD yesterday open sourced the FidelityFX SDK.</p>
<p>This SDK includes the likes of Blur, Depth of Field (DoF), Lens, Combined Adaptive Compute Ambient Occlusion (CACAO), Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS), Super Resolution (FSR 1 and 2), Luminance Preserving Mapper (LPM), Parallel Sort, Single Pass Downsampler (SPD), Stochastic Screen Space Reflections (SSSR), Variable Shading (VS), Hybrid Reflections and Hybrid Shadows.</p>
<p>AMD mentioned that as their collection of effects grew and became more widely used, they needed to improve how developers could actually integrate them. So this SDK is the result to bring " simplicity, structure, and consistency" for FidelityFX.</p>
<p>Some highlighted features they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A consistent standard and style that is much more user-friendly.</li>
<li>Easier application spawning letting us focus on core algorithm details rather than boilerplate setup code.</li>
<li>A re-architected graphical framework that is not only more robust and ready, but is also API agnostic, allowing us to develop our effects across intended targets simultaneously.
<ul>
<li>This also doubles as a great how-to in creating a custom backend implementation for developers’ own multi-platform engines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fidelityfx_sdk/fidelityfx_sdk-index/" target="_blank">Extensive documentation</a>.</li>
<li>And lastly, we’ve taken a lot of the guesswork out of implementation steps by offering complete pre-built solutions for all of our effects. Most of which can be supported in under 20 lines of code.
<ul>
<li>That being said, if you were a fan of taking the code we put out and manually integrating yourself, you are still free to do that. We’ve taken nothing away. All we’ve done is moved things into a more coherent structure on disk, and cleaned up the code to make it more consistent in style.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>After being removed from Steam, Betrayer is now free on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After vanishing from Steam quite a while ago in 2021, Betrayer from Blackpowder Games has <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/betrayer" target="_blank">resurfaced on GOG</a> and it's free to add to your account.</p>
<p>This is a bit of an odd one. The developer seemed to go silent, and then have it delisted on Steam. Their official Twitter account was also silent on it. However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220818035044/https://www.blackpowdergames.com/blog/blackpowder-games-acquired-by-john-ruth/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> shows that Blackpowder Games via their own official blog was acquired by John Ruth and then got turned into some odd news website.</p>
<p>However two days ago it resurfaced as a free game on GOG.com, with no explanation as to why. The official GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/release_betrayer_available_to_play_for_free" target="_blank">news post</a> doesn't clarify anything either, it just thanked Tyler "tfishell" for helping bring it to GOG and that's it. Weird.</p>

<p>Testing it on desktop Linux with Fedora KDE 38, thanks to the use of <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> to easily download GOG games it appears to work quite well with Wine-GE. Although, with my NVIDIA GPU I do see a few minor graphical glitches with shiny things like the water having weird spots over them. Apart from that, it performs well and looks good. Another free game to add to your collection - why not.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore large, open environments teeming with danger and discovery. Chart your own course in search of clues and treasures.</li>
<li>Switch between two distinct worlds featuring different enemies, obstacles, and threats.</li>
<li>Wield early 17th century weaponry including muskets, bows, crossbows, and tomahawks. Upgrade your arsenal by purchasing or finding faster, deadlier, longer-ranged weapons.</li>
<li>Charge headlong into battle with guns blazing or pick enemies off quietly. A novel, movement-based stealth system lets you hide in plain sight or use the wind to mask your footsteps.</li>
<li>Equip ability-enhancing Charms to complement your play style, granting anything from extra health to faster movement to improved stealth.</li>
<li>Play with the default visual style for maximum eeriness and tension or customize the color and contrast settings to suit your tastes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Tabletop inspired roguelike adventure Abalon adds Linux &amp; SteamOS support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Abalon (formerly known as Summoners Fate), a roguelike adventure game inspired by tabletop classics recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1681840/view/3647401472403677755" target="_blank">announced</a> official Linux and SteamOS support. They mentioned the Native port should offer "a dramatic performance increase and better build stability over running via Proton".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7547245921689169987gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7547245921689169987gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Abalon draws its inspiration from classic tabletop games like Hero Quest, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, combining tactical combat with thoughtful events decided with the trusty roll of a D20. Exploring Abalon is done in real-time, allowing you to uncover lore scrolls, shop for powerful cards and even attend a goblin's birthday party (don't forget your gold).</p>
<p>Combat brings Abalon into a turn-based game where unit positioning is as important as your spell casting. These tense encounters play out in arena-style maps where the environment isn't just for show, it's a key part of the battlefield. Equip powerful armor from a statue mid-fight. Slam your foes into a wall of spikes. Transform a tree behind enemy lines into an allied fighter. How you control the battlefield is your choice."</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers go for Native Linux support where it makes sense for them and they're able to do it easily enough. Seems the developer had requests from a few players so they decided to just do it. The developer also mentioned a major update is coming soon adding in Challenge Modifiers, new artifacts and thematic shops.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands releasing August 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following the Kickstarter success in 2019, Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands finally has a released date and it's coming soon on August 8th. The Kickstarter pulled in 2,247 backers pledging $59,202 - so hopefully we're about to see another great game.</p>
<p>What is it: A role-playing game featuring musical themes with an affinity for the sick and righteous. The story revolves around a deadly battle of the bands contest, where entrants can attack and be attacked with music. Based on the <a href="https://deathbulge.com/comics" target="_blank">Deathbulge comic</a> from Dan Martin.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hXEP4cm7Res"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de3f7bdec9ee22fbfa7b9e8b05f1dc04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hXEP4cm7Res" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Customise the band with 9 musically-themed classes to choose from, each with their own attacks, perks and sensational appearance.</li>
<li>Kick down every single door you come across, regardless of how unlocked they might be.</li>
<li>Some doors will be too strong to kick down. That's why you gotta kick down weaker doors to level up your door kicking skill until you're strong enough.</li>
<li>Fancy combat system that focuses on BAR EFFECTS. What happens BETWEEN turns makes all the difference, bringing real-time elements into the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Sew patches of band logos onto your BATTLE JACKET for extra perks in BATTLE.</li>
<li>No Random Encounters! Monsters will be shown on the field for your avoiding leisure.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack that'll make you say things like SIIICK and OH RIGHT ON.</li>
<li>Bursting at the seams with humour, absurdity and a wide variety of colourful characters, armed with an abundance of dialogue faces to express themselves TO THE MAX.</li>
<li>A rich world packed with well over 100 unique NPCs.</li>
<li>Even the ITEMS have personality. Say bye bye to the generic "HEALTH POTION". Local NPC Barry Friendly is taking care of the soothing beverages around here. Sink into a warm cup of BARRY FRIENDLY'S TEA whenever your health is low. Maybe you'll even have the pleasure of meeting Barry at some point.</li>
<li>One of the enemies you fight is a skateboarding platypus.</li>

      <title>Vampire Survivors switching to new game engine on August 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The smash indie hit Vampire Survivors is planning to finally move over to their newer and upgraded game engine on August 17th.</p>
<p>A big change for the game to go from Phaser to Unity but it should hopefully be well worth it. This will bring with it better cross-platform support, big performance improvements and give the developers a better platform to continue expanding the game as time goes on - like for the upcoming local co-op mode.</p>
<p>The news was announced on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1794680/announcements/detail/3650779172120262146" target="_blank">Steam</a> where they've also noted that Steam Trading Cards are now live, plus <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7muK6D2Mvfk&amp;t=5870s" target="_blank">IGN</a> recently got a co-op hands on with an unfinished build that might answer some questions for you. The developers say they're still working on it, trying to put in as many co-op options as possible along with a special item only in co-op.</p>
<p>On top of that they're also hosting a real-world co-op event hands-on in early August in London (UK). More details on that when they announce it.</p>
<p>The original co-op trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-j2budq0Qpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6c3fac23889a68c971fddc53dabb366.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-j2budq0Qpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with Proton too. It does have a Native Linux version in Beta but it's not really clear what they plan to do with it there.</p>

      <title>Microsoft wins against FTC to buy Activision Blizzard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, the results are here. In the USA the FTC was trying to block Microsoft from acquiring Activision Blizzard but Microsoft has won the fight. Now Microsoft are one big step closer to actually properly closing the deal, and a rather big consolidation of the gaming industry given how big Activision Blizzard are.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.413969/gov.uscourts.cand.413969.305.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">decision</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox. It made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Switch. And it entered several agreements to for the first time bring Activision’s content to several cloud gaming services.</p>
<p>This Court’s responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action. For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the temporary restraining order against the acquisition will be removed on July 14th, unless the FTC obtains a "stay pending appeal from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals".</p>
<p>Microsoft still have a fight ahead in the UK though, since the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) blocked the deal but naturally Microsoft is appealing the decision with a hearing set to begin on July 28th. So they're not completely out of the woods yet but it's probable Microsoft will end up winning there too. <strong>Update</strong> 16:21 UTC - Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President Microsoft, put a statement on <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1678796043545350144/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After today's court decision in the U.S., our focus now turns back to the UK. While we ultimately disagree with the CMA’s concerns, we are considering how the transaction might be modified in order to address those concerns in a way that is acceptable to the CMA. In order to prioritize work on these proposals, Microsoft and Activision have agreed with the CMA that a stay of the litigation in the UK would be in the public interest and the parties have made a joint submission to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to this effect.</p>

<p>What do you think to this outcome?</p>
