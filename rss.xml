      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED have released the latest major free update for Cyberpunk 2077 today, bringing with it new content and graphics enhancements. It's quite a big one too, with a lot more than I expected them to add in after the last update. Nice to see them still continue to expand it though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qPcPBaWhny4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64a924f4b2cf93127f147f1ca37d22cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qPcPBaWhny4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Vehicles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:
	<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Hunt and The Beast In Me). An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</li>
<li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search and Destroy)."</li>
<li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...). If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</li>
<li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong> Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introducing AutoDrive! This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map). If you have no set destination, it will take you on a leisurely ride through the streets of Night City. Simply hop in any of your vehicles, make sure you're on a road, and hold H (PC) / Left Stick (consoles) to activate. This feature is disabled when you enter combat or when your vehicle is heavily damaged.</li>
<li>Implemented Cinematic Camera for AutoDrive. Hold Q (PC) / D-Pad Right (consoles) to activate. Sit back and enjoy cinematic views of Night City as you cruise toward your destination.</li>
<li>Self-driving Delamain cabs are now available on demand! Simply open the menu to call vehicles, then select "Delamain Cab" from the list to request a ride. This feature unlocks after completing the job Don't Lose Your Mind (regardless of outcome) and receiving a message from Delamain.</li>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ is now available for vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles. Additionally, the infamous hacker known as Cosmetic_Troll exploited a vulnerability and created a cracked version of Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology for lower-end vehicles. Please note, however, that some models do not support the technology, such as heavily modded nomad vehicles and job-related vehicles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color schemes did not work properly on the Mizutani Shion MZ1 and MZ2.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color scheme could not be applied properly to the Villefort Deleon "Vindicator".</li>
</ul>
<h4>Photo Mode</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added 27 new NPCs that can be spawned in Photo Mode, including Rita Wheeler, the Cassel twins, fixers, Dum Dum, the iguana, Brendan, and more.</li>

<li>You can now switch between V's saved Wardrobe outfits in Photo Mode.</li>

	<ul>
<li>Weather: includes rain, acid rain, fog, sandstorm, pollution, and sunny.</li>
<li>Time of Day: changes the time of day within Photo Mode.</li>
<li>Frame Forward: advances through an unlimited amount of frames to capture the perfect shot.</li>
<li>Game Speed: allows in-game time to progress while in Photo Mode."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quality of Life &amp; Accessibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>The game will now detect if the player is using inverted mouse button settings and automatically adjusts in-game button prompts accordingly.</li>
<li>Added an option to toggle aiming down sights in Settings → Controls.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Jobs &amp; Open World</h4>

</ul>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>

To enable this feature, your display must support the technology (<a href="https://hdr10plus.org/certified-products/?product-type=&amp;manufacturer=&amp;feature=product_gaming&amp;search-term=" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">find my display</a>) and have "Game Mode" enabled.

      <title>NVIDIA 570.172.08 released for Linux as the main stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA are continuing to make us guess what's included in their updates with the NVIDIA driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/249205/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.172.08</a> release today.</p>
<p>This is part of their Recommended/Certified driver series, their main stable series that updates a bit slower with new features compared with the New Feature Branch. Much like NVIDIA did with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent driver 575.64.03 release</a>, they're being rather vague as they channel mobile app store changelog energy with this.</p>
<p>The entire changelog is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. And unlike the 575.64.03 release, they haven't stealthily added RTX 5050 support to it as that's not currently listed in the supported products for this driver.</p>
<p>At this point I can only speculate, as it's not even listed yet on the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub to sleuth through. Perhaps we <em>might</em> see some more security issues get revealed in a few weeks / month, which would make some sense on why they're being repeatedly vague with these latest two driver updates as to not give anything away but get people updated and prepared. Potentially related to <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5671" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rowhammer</a> that they recently put up a security bulletin on. It could also be nothing of the sort - we just don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Update at 16:50 UTC</strong> - now that it's actually up on the open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub, we <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/commit/4d6c416e7fd20dba9b24e6b1d352284473af7812" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">can see</a> they did in fact tag RTX 5050 as supported with this release, despite the models missing from the driver update page.</p>
<p><em>I've emailed NVIDIA this time to see if we can get some clearer details.</em></p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is set to arrive sometime soon, and they've ensured it works well on Steam Deck as it's Verified ahead of release. They're not giving the release date out for Early Access yet, but the publisher has already sent a key for GamingOnLinux testing.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's time to conquer the world of extreme sports. This is Descenders Next. Grab your snowboard and tackle the steep, snowy slopes, or tear up the harsh, lush terrain with your mountainboard! Feel like taking on the challenge with a squad? Match up with your friends and Descenders players all around the world, and take on the tracks together! The mountain is calling - will you master it?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155816311752758559gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Sharing the Steam Deck news in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/535481986904490066" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said "One of the main things we wanted to make sure is that Descenders Next runs great on Steam Deck, so we're super glad we can give you the ultimate experience!". The status isn't live yet, but developers do get notified before the Steam Deck notice goes live.</p>
<p>It was originally due to launch April 9th, but it was delayed in March to give it a little more time to cook. During Early Access they plan to add in more sports, more game modes - more everything.</p>
<p>They have more news to come on Descenders Day, July 21st.</p>

      <title>Impressive free and open source RTS 0 A.D. gets an essential patch update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is a free and open source RTS game that saw a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/open-source-rts-0-a-d-alpha-27-released-bringing-a-new-vulkan-renderer-new-maps-amd-fsr-and-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first release in years back in January</a>, now an important bug fix patch is out now. This aims to clean up the most pressing issues, as part of their new workflow to get releases out much quicker.</p>
<p>The game has often been compared to the likes of Age of Empires, actually starting life as a concept mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. It's a full free standalone strategy game like the classics.</p>
<p>See the previous update trailer for some footage on it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3MhcRPm7Zhg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c87fd27136abb6533f05e58d5d13c35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3MhcRPm7Zhg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here are the changes included in A27.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A fix for the large performance issue observed by some players on older hardware.</li>
<li>Several small performance improvements in the calculation of simulation hashes (related to multiplayer stuttering).</li>
<li>Fixed support of Windows 7.</li>
<li>A fix for modifying your lobby password when you have an uppercase letter in your username.</li>
<li>A fix for the distorted 3D models with GPU Skinning.</li>
<li>Fixes for crashes with Vulkan and/or with GPU Skinning.</li>
<li>A fix for changing player perspective in replays.</li>
<li>A fix for an out-of-memory crash in the JS engine when generating random maps.</li>
<li>A fix for the game crash on pressing Fn key.</li>
<li>A fix for a crash in Atlas when the map generation fails.</li>
<li>A fix for a memory leak in the renderer.</li>
<li>Fixes for multiplayer port forwarding.</li>
<li>Package fixes for Linux desktop environments.</li>
<li>Various build fixes for Linux (some sent by package managers).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's compatible with players who do not have the release, as it's just a small essential update while they work on the next major version.</p>

      <title>felix86 emulator for Linux for x86 and x86-64 apps on RISC-V can now run Steam and major games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can now play some major games on RISC-V systems running Linux, thanks to the felix86 emulator that's really coming along. <em>I covered the felix86 project initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/felix86-is-a-new-open-source-linux-emulator-to-run-x86-64-linux-programs-on-risc-v-processors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in May</a>.</em></p>
<p>With RISC-V slowly and steadily growing in the background, it's great to see projects like this for gaming on more hardware. One of the developers emailed in to note they've "made quite a bit of progress since May" and that "Now, felix86 can run Windows titles like Crysis and Witcher 3 on RISC-V". Additionally, "we even got the Linux Steam client working, which means games that have Steam DRM can be played on RISC-V with felix86".</p>
<p>They sent along a screenshot of Steam running on their RISC-V board too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14847659061752748516gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14847659061752748516gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The latest release from June 30th implemented a lot of what was missing to get to this stage, which they covered in a fresh <a href="https://felix86.com/AAA-Games/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Amazing work by all the developers involved.</p>

      <title>Make-A-Wish UK launches the Wish 200 Week Charity Sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Help make some dreams come true for critically ill children in the Wish 200 Week Charity Sale that's now live on Steam.</p>
<p>During this event a bunch of games are going on sale, with each game donating a percentage of sales to Make-A-Wish UK. Your chance to grab some new games and feel good about it at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19443750341752748038gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release, Jason Suckley, Chief Executive of Make-A-Wish UK says: ​ </p>
<p>"We’re thrilled to see the Wish 200 Week campaign return in 2025 for its fifth year. One of the highlights is the Make-A-Wish UK Charity Sale, which will directly support in helping to make more life-changing wishes come true. </p>
<p>For many critically ill children, gaming is a lifeline. It provides a social outlet during long treatment cycles when they can’t attend school or clubs with friends; it offers respite and distraction from daily challenges, and it opens the door to a welcoming community where they can be themselves again. </p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible generosity of our supporters, we hope to raise vital funds that will bring hope, joy, and strength to even more children when they need it most.  </p>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped make this charity sale a reality. Thank you."</p>

      <title>Battlesmiths: Blade &amp; Forge announced Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battlesmiths: Blade &amp; Forge is a tactical RPG where every piece of gear is forged by you, and there's also some town-building involved too.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really fun mixture of genres here and it's nice to see the developer getting dedicated Steam Deck testing in early. As they said in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2583940/view/527600687561834544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the game is a while away but "Our testing shows great results with launching and playing Battlesmiths on Steam Deck (in fact, some of our developers now prefer it to any other platform)".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N7NIzg1azVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8249d912549e25f9f1c07a7a44fa11c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N7NIzg1azVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they said "We can safely say that Battlesmiths is already fully playable on Steam Deck via the already available touch screen control options and will be compatible with Steam Deck upon Steam release".</p>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Crafting that matters</h4>
<p>In <em>Battlesmiths</em>, gear isn’t loot — it’s the result of your labor.<br/>
Weapons and armor are crafted by you and directly affect how your heroes look and fight. Add runes to weapons for powerful abilities. Enchant armor to customize your squad. Customize the appearances of every hero the way you like.</p>
<h4>Rebuild a broken town</h4>
<p>Upgrade blacksmiths, alchemists, miners and more. Each building adds new systems, from resource production to advanced gear recipes. Your town is the heart of your progress.</p>
<h4>Tactical, squad-based combat</h4>
<p>Command a team of up to four heroes in strategic semi-auto battles.<br/>
Choose gear carefully: classes are defined by weapon types, and every loadout impacts movement, damage, and attack speed.</p>
<h4>Multiple game modes</h4>
<p>Whether you love PvE or PvP, there’s always something to conquer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: story-driven solo missions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arena</strong>: fight other players and prove you're the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labyrinth</strong>: test your build in a brutal survival mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tower of Trials</strong>: scaling challenges with high rewards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clan boss</strong>: cooperate to bring down a massive foe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adventure</strong>: limited-time missions and side quests</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth announced with swappable magnetic ABXY</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't need another controller, at this point I have 7 but another couldn't hurt right? The 8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth with swappable magnetic ABXY looks lovely.</p>
<p>Compatible with SteamOS / Steam Deck too, with 8BitDo saying "all of its inputs have been optimized to fully work with Steam". This has me quite excited actually. It's a fully featured controller too with a charging dock, 2.4G wireless in addition to Bluetooth, Hall Effect Triggers &amp; Mode Switching, TMR Joysticks and of course there's the fancy magnetic ABXY so you can play it in the standard or Nintendo layout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828702481752745040gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828702481752745040gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It also has extra remappable Fast Bumpers (R4 and L4 buttons) that doesn't require any software, a refined D-pad, back buttons and wear resistant joystick rings. Sounds like an excellent update over the Pro 2 Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless is my all-time favourite</a> controller but I do love the look of this.</p>
<p>It will release August 12, 2025 for the US at $69.99, but no exact date for the UK or EU yet.</p>

      <title>Umamusume: Pretty Derby now Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible and works on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another game with anti-cheat that released on Steam recently is Umamusume: Pretty Derby. Valve just rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>What is it? This Anime gacha game is all about magical girl horse racing. You recruit various characters for your team, get them training and compete in races. In between there's lots of visual-novel style animated chatter, with plenty of voice acting too. It's a thoroughly weird concept but as an Anime fan, I've seen a <em>lot</em> stranger than this. It also looks surprisingly…good?</p>
<p>Clearly popular too with a peak player count of 48,266 in the last 24 hours and a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>It uses "CrackProof" kernel-level anti-cheat so it's pleasing to see the developer Cygames, Inc. has enabled it for Linux platforms. Valve tested it with the latest stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> for their verification and the only thing holding it back from being Verified according to Valve is that some text can be a bit small on the Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p>As usual for GamingOnLinux, I like to first-hand verify everything I possibly can that I report on. And despite complete information <em>overload</em> when going through all the tutorials, it works with no problems on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17297084901752673458gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17297084901752673458gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19221286731752673459gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19221286731752673459gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Umamusume: Pretty Derby on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Testing it myself also on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 9.0-4, it also worked completely out of the box. No launch options needed, no changes to the Proton version. Just completely click and play with the defaults which is really great to see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19549036801752672861gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19549036801752672861gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Umamusume: Pretty Derby on Linux</em></p>
<p>Just be aware if you decide to try it that once it's downloaded and launched, it then needs to do an additional in-game download before you can actually play it.</p>
<p>See the original release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uCaWqXP54Mc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7368d864ff4cbfc2235b2a77b479b56b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even if this style of game is not your personal go-to, it's important to see as many of these working as possible. It only takes one or two games not working to prevent someone being comfortable using Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Nice to see more games with anti-cheat get enabled like this along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lost-ark-from-amazon-games-appears-to-have-enabled-the-anti-cheat-for-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lost Ark</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/wuthering-waves-now-steam-deck-playable-and-works-on-desktop-linux-with-one-tweak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wuthering Waves</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/blue-archive-from-nexon-arrives-on-steam-and-works-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blue Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-finals-is-getting-new-kernel-based-anti-cheat-likely-to-break-it-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Finals</a> getting confirmed to continue support.

      <title>Silence of the Siren renames to Heroes of Science and Fiction to pull in more HoMM fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Science and Fiction is the new name for Silence of the Siren from Oxymoron Games, as they try to pull in more fans of Heroes of Might and Magic. <em>The name change came along with a major update to the game.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A turn-based strategy game where several different space-faring civilisations fight over control of a distant star system. Explore what's left on the planets and secure resources to build mighty cities. Raise powerful armies and defeat your opponents on the battlefield. Overall, it's a pretty great take on modernised HoMM-styled strategy and it has a Very Positive rating from players on Steam.</p>
<p>Explaining why they changed the name they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To address the elephant in the room first though, your eyes are not misleading you - after carefully considering this step for months, we decided to change the name of the game from Silence of the Siren to the long-term working title, Heroes of Science and Fiction. You're no doubt curious why, so here are the main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was really easy to mix up the name with other games in the genre, and we saw too many cases of for example Youtubers struggling to remember the name.</li>
<li>The new name should make it much more obvious to HoMM fans that this game is in the same genre as the beloved classic, which is really important when players see it on any list on Steam and decide whether to have a closer look.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The new update includes a full Map Editor, Steam Workshop integration and quite a lot of new content. There's a whole new planet with a 6-phase day-night cycle, 7 new maps, new neutral units, a Beta version of a map generator and various smaller changes.</p>
<p>A new mini trailer was released to highlight the features in the update:</p>

      <title>Lost Ark from Amazon Games appears to have enabled the anti-cheat for Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lost Ark is a free to play MMO from Smilegate RPG and Amazon Games that was previously blocked on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck but now works.</p>
<p>Originally launched February 2022, there's been one or two times in the past where the anti-cheat very briefly let people in and then continued blocking shortly after. But not it appears it might actually be here to stay. The developer did not make any announcement on this I can find anywhere, but their Easy Anti-Cheat system appears to have been enabled for at least a full two weeks now.</p>

<em>Pictured - Lost Ark on Kubuntu 25.04</em></p>
<p>Using the current main stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>, the game was completely click and play for me. Nothing special needed, no launch options — it just worked. Nice to see another online game working on Linux platforms! Shame it took so long on this one.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Linux anti-cheat compatibility page</a> has been updated.</p>

      <title>Avowed from Obsidian and Xbox now Steam Deck Verified with Update 1.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avowed from Obsidian Entertainment / Xbox Game Studios is now fully Steam Deck Verified with the big new 1.5 update.</p>
<p>You have to hand it to games published by Xbox Game Studios (Microsoft), they've been some of the most open AAA games that have ensured they work well on Linux platforms with Proton like SteamOS. Along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gears-of-war-reloaded-is-officially-steam-deck-verified-and-steamos-compatible/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enabling anti-cheat</a> in their games too where <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many other publishers do not</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1660988641752660953gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice how being Steam Deck Verified is right at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/510711823303967381" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">list</a> of changes. Not just that though the update adds in new abilities and passives for the Ranger and Fighter, new items, there's an update to enemy combat behaviour, TAA will now actually be off if upscaling is off, there's a new 40FPS limit option (likely for Steam Deck), custom map markers were added in lots more.</p>
<p>The full changelog is below:</p>

      <title>Blender 4.5 LTS arrives with Vulkan fully supported and lots of performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big day in Blender land with the arrival of Blender 4.5 LTS, finally bringing Vulkan up to full supported status with it matching OpenGL. This will ensure Blender can continue building up advanced graphical features with good performance.</p>
<p>Blender is easily one of the most important open source projects out there, and it's great to see more and more game devs pick it up. Along with other industries. In case you missed it the Blender Studio team recently released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/dogwalk-is-a-free-casual-game-from-the-blender-studio-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DOGWALK made with Godot</a>.</p>
<p>There's absolutely masses of new features, and plenty of features were tweaked to improve their performance for this release too. So the app should start up faster and remains smoother. A lot of UI work again went into this release to polish it up, make it more intuitive and accessible.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPhA0imjvVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b58e666bb974a42c664f898a2df05ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPhA0imjvVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Specifically on Linux they also added large cursors for hi-DPI monitors and support for the Hyper modifier key.</p>
<p>Check out all the changes on the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Blender website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam adds Trade Protected Items starting with Counter-Strike 2, along with a bit of Half-Life fan trolling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Counter-Strike 2 has begun a new season, and Valve added a new feature called Trade Protected Items and they're poking fun at Half-Life fans too.</p>
<p>Firstly the funny bit. This is <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/529852487375519751" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Season 3 of Counter-Strike 2</a>, and we all know the joke about how Valve "can't count to 3" right? How Half-Life 3 is this mythical beast that will never arrive. And, even if / when Valve do a new Half-Life many expect it not to be called Half-Life 3 just to avoid it. Well, Valve called Season 3 of Counter-Strike 2 "Season Two: Episode One" just to rub it in that little bit more.</p>
<p>A nice bit of self-awareness. Amusing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3846304721752659117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A new feature has also been added to Steam starting with Counter-Strike 2 called Trade Protected Items. Allowing you to reverse all CS2 trades from the last 7 days, which could help in the unlikely event you lose control of your Steam account or were the target of a scam.

      <title>Valve gets pressured by payment processors with a new rule for game devs and various adult games removed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17/07/25 21:44 UTC</strong> - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux with this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks. As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam.</p>
<p>We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Valve have added a new rule to the Onboarding guide for game developers, noting that payment processors get a say in what stays on Steam.</p>
<p>Recently, a number of people noticed and posted across various Reddits that PayPal has been unavailable for days, so it's possible this is all coming from PayPal but nothing has been confirmed on that.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steamworks</a> the new rule is noted under the "What you shouldn’t publish on Steam" heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SteamDB noticed this, and also noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> thread how numerous incest games had been removed:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8499127041752665425gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That's a very specific type of game removal but could only be the beginning of a wider crackdown on the types of adult content allowed on Steam.</p>
<p>Valve certainly aren't the first to have this happen. Patreon has also seen issues with payment processors like PayPal in the past with adult content. So, it's not really a surprise that this has happened, the surprise to me is that payment processors haven't come down on Valve sooner for all these types of games because they really don't like their services being used for it. It's not like Valve have a choice in this either, they could fight it but it would probably be a lot more costly than it's worth to them.</p>
<p>I've asked Valve to provide a comment and will update if they reply but it's unlikely they will in cases like this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The upcoming skate. from EA will be unsupported on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>skate. is an upcoming next-generation skateboarding game and it's now confirmed it will not support Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to anti-cheat.</p>
<p>This should perhaps be no surprise since it's an EA (Electronic Arts) published title. They've been gradually moving over older games to their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newer EA Javelin Anticheat</a> that completely blocks Linux platforms. Plus, how they also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blocked Apex Legends too</a> which uses Easy Anti-Cheat. And with skate. being an online game with no offline mode, it was a given that it would have anti-cheat and now it's fully confirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7495807271752616244gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - skate., credit: EA</em></p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3354750/view/636812613495292422" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> on Steam, these two key FAQ points should be noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How will we make sure players have all the appropriate safety/privacy controls? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At EA and Full Circle, we believe in the power of Positive Play. In skate, we want to ensure everyone has a great time, but if something goes sideways, it’s important to empower players to let us know quickly. We have EA Javelin anti-cheat monitoring for any unfair gameplay issues and in-game reporting for other issues like griefing. There are also numerous privacy options (blocking teleporting, spectating, and disabling the ability of others to move your Build Kit items).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will skate. be available for Mac OS, Steam OS, Proton/Linux systems (handle held PCs like the Steam Deck) for Early Access? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We want to bring skate. to as many platforms as possible and will continue to listen to feedback and look at the feasibility of adding new platforms in the future, but for Early Access launch, MacOS, SteamOS, Proton/Linux will not be supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really do hope Valve keep pushing SteamOS <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">so this anti-cheat problem can eventually be solved</a> as I wrote about before here on GamingOnLinux. It's such a thorn in the side of Linux gaming, one of the last true major hurdles for it to overcome.</p>
<p>At this point, it's also worth reminding people that any upcoming Windows kernel changes will mean nothing for Linux / SteamOS gaming. I wrote about it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in September 2024</a> due to various clickbait articles elsewhere. It's come up <em>again</em> recently due to another Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/26/the-windows-resiliency-initiative-building-resilience-for-a-future-ready-enterprise/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, which talks about new security solutions that work outside of the kernel (for people who don't read it - developers "can" use it, they're not being forced), but everything I wrote before remains the same. If developers want to block Linux, they will continue to do so.</p>

      <title>Popular free online shooter STRAFTAT just got a big content expansion with 4 player support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STRAFTAT is a free to play arena shooter that's quite popular, and it just had a big content expansion with support for 4 players. It has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>Originally a 1v1 frag-fest, it now supports teams along with free for all up to 4 players total. This can be a mixture of 2v2, 1v2, 1v3 and so on. While there's a lot of online shooters, STRAFTAT sets itself apart from the back-to-basics arena gameplay with each round being a completely different environment with a different set of weapons. It's complete chaos in the best of ways.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-F7PsHqJh_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d8ab54aa20d3bf523c824d016109f2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-F7PsHqJh_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Gamemodes : Teams, FFA (both : up to 4 players).</li>
<li>New lobby settings (Friendly fire, mid match joining, player outline).</li>
<li>Reworked and improved Main Menu interface.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements on Logs in killfeed.</li>
<li>Added 4 Player Spawn Points to each map.</li>
<li>Weapon Randomizer Improvements (Customize weapon pool, spawn rate…).</li>
<li>Native Map Playlists.</li>
<li>Added Speedometer (Enable in Graphics Options).</li>
<li>Map Playlists export/import (easy to share your playlists online).</li>
<li>Killcam improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair revenue model too for a free game. There's a DLC with more maps, weapons and cosmetics. The maps and weapons are enabled for any players as long as the host owns it. There's also a new supporter edition DLC with this update that adds more cosmetics.</p>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition has arrived and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition is now here from Aspyr Media, updating the classic from 2006. It arrives after multiple leaks rated by Valve as Steam Deck Verified, SteamOS Compatible and should work fine on Desktop Linux with the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Nice to see another oldie revived with a number of enhancements, but will it be enough to pull in some fresh players?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2N_7XaKuFLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/796b88cec525a9e1e2a6ec7c3536b965.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2N_7XaKuFLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gather Your Party</strong>: Assemble a team of your friends across any and all platforms with fully supported crossplay. Together, embark on an epic journey governed by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 ruleset.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Legend</strong>: Make your mark on the Realms as you play your way through over 100 hours of immersive gameplay and four unique campaigns, each as expansive as the Bag of Holding.</li>
<li><strong>Or a Dungeon Master</strong>: Bring your pen-and-paper campaign to life! Craft your own solo or multiplayer D&amp;D adventures or explore the creations of others.</li>
<li><strong>A Relic, Restored</strong>: Everything you loved about Neverwinter Nights 2 has been preserved. Enjoy smoother gameplay with refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not really nostalgic for the Neverwinter Nights series, so it's one frankly I'm skipping over entirely.</p>
<p>Are you going to be picking it up? Aspyr are doing a lot of these remasters now, so hopefully it's a good one. If not, hopefully they will get some updates out to solve any lingering issues.</p>

      <title>Wuthering Waves now Steam Deck Playable, and works on Desktop Linux with one tweak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Wuthering Waves launched on Steam, it was left broken on all Linux platforms including SteamOS and Steam Deck but now it works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/wuthering-waves-arrives-on-steam-another-with-anti-cheat-problems-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer noted on their Steam page</a> after release how they were working on it, and it seems they've recently updated their version of Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) to allow it all to work.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck / SteamOS, Valve have today <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3513350/history/?changeid=30069803" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">officially</a> bumped it up from Unsupported to Playable with Valve's testing using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>. I've launched it on my Steam Deck LCD, and it does indeed load up fine now and you can get in-game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7610375921752592512gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7610375921752592512gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Valve note a couple of issues though, preventing it being fully Verified:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This game's launcher/setup tool may require the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or have difficult to read text.</li>
<li>Some functionality is not accessible when using the default controller configuration, requiring use of the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or a community configuration.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does have an Unreal Engine 4 prerequisites installer that needs the touch-screen or emulated mouse input on Steam Deck. Same with agreeing to their terms of service on the initial first run. Then you get to the login, and agreeing to other terms of services. After that, gamepad controls works fine.</p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux, we saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/ge-proton-10-8-brings-fixes-for-doom-eternal-wuthering-waves-and-wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updates to GE-Proton</a> only recently that enabled it to work too. Currently, Proton 9 and Proton Experimental do not work for it out of the box. However, Proton Experimental <em>will</em> allow you to get in if you set this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamOS=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Otherwise, you can use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/ge-proton-10-9-released-with-ntsync-and-fsr4-upgrade-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest GE-Proton 10-9</a> that does it for you. <em>See my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full guide to installing GE-Proton for help</a>.</em></p>

<p>Since it's not supported on Desktop Linux, it could potentially break again. But it works for now. Check out more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page for Linux systems</a>.</p>

      <title>Shark Dentist looks a bit silly, tense, gruesome and I need to play it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't know who thought that it was a good idea to be a Shark Dentist, in what looks like a set from a cheap horror movie - but now I have to try it.</p>
<p>Coming from Alice Games who previously made two VR games Monster Rampage VR, Santa’s Letters VR and the non-VR Broventure: The Wild Co-op. Frankly, I had never heard of any of those until now. Perhaps this silly idea might be their first proper hit. They say it will appeal to "horror fans, streamers, and lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw". I just recently watched The Meg and The Meg 2 as well, so it's rather timely. I do love a bit of dumb monster horror like this.</p>
<p>Your main enemies in it will be: Shark Stress, bringing it ever-closer to waking up and snacking on you; Limited Resources, so don't use too much anaesthetic; and Random Event, where your equipment might fail on you and various "other surprises".</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Intense Gameplay: Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</li>
<li>Roguelike Mechanics: Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</li>
<li>Multitasking: Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</li>
<li>Realistic Tool Interaction: Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</li>
<li>Organic Balance: Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the press release the dev was inspired by viral sensations like Buckshot Roulette, with it blending dark humour and roguelike mechanics wrapped up in a creepy aesthetic.</p>

      <title>The Alters gets patched to replace AI generated bits, fix a Steam Deck crash and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Alters from 11 bit studios appears to be doing very well, apart from the controversy over the AI generated bits. A new patch is out to fix it up.</p>
<p>Back in June, there was a lot going around about players discovering some AI generated assets in the game, which were not disclosed on store pages like Steam. Not a lot, but enough that it caused a bit of an uproar. The developer posted on social media (like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) with a statement to clear it up noting that they were meant as placeholders. There were also some AI translations for a few licensed in-game movies in the social area that were done due to "extreme time constraints" they had planned to replace.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="965Km7t6KwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/363c3b32c727fb63b37c93538bb3a17a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/965Km7t6KwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/555747819912167772" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch 1.1.0</a>, this should all be cleared up now, as noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Localization and VOs: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple missing and wrong translations.</li>
<li>Occasional missing voiceovers.</li>
<li>Replaced LLM generated text on Command Center asset.</li>
<li>Replaced machine translated subtitles in Social Room movies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair amount of bug fixes came with this update too like a Steam Deck crash when progressing onto a new chapter. Nice to see direct fixes like that.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">The developer also recently revealed that less than a month after release it sold over 280,000 copies as well.</span></p>

      <title>RimWorld – Odyssey expansion is out now along with update 1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld has expanded in a massive way with the Odyssey expansion and the 1.6 update, now available for all players.</p>
<p>This is the fifth expansion to the hit sci-fi colony building sim. Pushing beyond a single map to allow your colonists to build a flying home and travel across the planet and even into space. With new biomes that introduce diverse landmarks and exotic wildlife, and dynamic quests include hunting alpha thrumbos and raiding ancient cryosleep bunker. And when you're done on land you can head into space where you'll find space stations, asteroids and something stirring in the dark.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FutmQwQ-O2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa8dae10770bd166202cd51e00f76a58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FutmQwQ-O2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The game has always created a whole world beyond the colony, but it was hard to get out there and actually explore it,” said Tynan Sylvester, founder of Ludeon Studios. “Turning the whole colony into a giant movable ship unlocks all that latent story potential. And once we did that I figured hell, why not go to orbit as well?”</p>
<p>With the new biomes there's distinct hazards and new opportunities, along with a new landmarks system that transforms the world generation. Giving you many new options to build colonies, there's also a lot of new animal species to find, fishing mechanics were added, multi-part story quests and then list of what's new goes on and on. With all of it coming to a new late-game threat with the machine hive mind.</p>
<p>The expansion also includes a whole new album from Alistair Lindsay, composer of the RimWorld soundtrack.</p>

      <title>Try the big demo upgrade for Demon Tides, an impressive looking open-world 3D platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An open world platformer where you express yourself with different movements, Demon Tides looks like a lot of fun and it just had a huge demo upgrade. It's in development by Fabraz. A name perhaps you might recognise from Slime-san and Demon Turf.</p>
<p>You navigate the open seas to find distant structures, which you then explore with a diverse set of moves. Beat challenges, find chests and go collecting. Some trinkets you find can even modify and expand you abilities and outfits. Looks really cool, check out the original reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BOqwY4H1d0Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/111598e28247bcef261298c0081c75b4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BOqwY4H1d0Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

It's a long list of what's changed, including lots of gameplay updates and bug fixes. Well worth a go now and should work fine with Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A deeply expressive platforming move-set that enables you to travel through the world in countless unique ways. Express yourself through your schmovement and get lost in the flow!</li>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition to release August 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Relic Entertainment have announced that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition is set for release on August 14th. Hopefully it will see a better reception than the recently released Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition, which is currently on Mostly Negative on the Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>At release it will cost $29.99, with a 30% discount if you own the Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pY_JzB0WxSA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d251e766aac3d585242b205b2964c4fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer has mentioned there will be no new content or post-launch DLC, as their focus is on "delivering the ultimate Dawn of War experience" to have everything from the original. As for multiplayer, they're aiming to keep everything mostly the same there apart from "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs that should help improve the multiplayer experience". However, they've also said "not all legacy bugs will be addressed for launch" and they're already planned updates at release.</p>
<p>They also have a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dawnofwar.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky account</a> you can follow too.</p>
<p>Will you be buying it?</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling Frame Gen gets a Decky Loader Steam Deck plugin but there&#39;s drama</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 14/07/2025 at 17:50 UTC - the developer of lsfg-vk, "Pancake", issued a new statement about the situation. This was <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1394368550583668736" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> into the Lossless Scaling Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update on Deck Wizard's video and the Decky plugin</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone! I'd like to clear up some things after the previous announcement, which caused way too much unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I've been talking to both Deck Wizard and Kurt (xXJSONDeruloXx on GitHub), who is the creator of the Decky plugin. The situation we got into was caused purely by poor communication, so we sat down and discussed the future of the plugin together.</p>
<p>Let's get into the news then.<br/>
The Decky plugin will remain unofficial and unsupported in this discord, not as a means to discourage using it, but rather to keep the growing load of support away from me, as I have barely anything to do with the plugin. Together with Kurt and Deck Wizard we've fixed the major labeling issues in the plugin, as well as created an update video on Deck Wizard's channel that you can watch here:<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhkCev9M6lM<br/>
Future support with the Decky plugin will happen in the Discord server linked in the video description and depending on which category your issue falls into, you may be forwarded to this discord instead.</p>
<p>In the future, some pretty big changes will be coming to lsfg-vk which will likely require a portion of the plugin to adapt. I will be working with Kurt to get the changes into the plugin as quickly as possible, however this warrants a whole other announcement and I can't promise any timeframe (it could be hours, days or weeks).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>There's some drama in Steam Deck land with a Decky Loader plugin, that works with Lossless Scaling Frame Generation from the new lsfg-vk project for Linux.</p>
<p>The lsfg-vk project itself was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lsfg-vk-aims-to-bring-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-to-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first covered here on GamingOnLinux on July 7th</a>, and the developer has recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scalings-frame-generation-for-linux-gets-upgraded-to-the-latest-v3-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">managed to upgrade it</a> with the help of the original Lossless Scaling developer. It's still a work in progress and a little rough but it does work.</p>
<p>Since there was a lot of excitement around it, a <em>different</em> developer decided to make a Decky Loader (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-set-up-decky-loader-on-steam-deck-steamos-for-easy-plugins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my Decky Loader guide</a>) plugin (<a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/decky-lossless-scaling-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) to make it easier to work with it on SteamOS / Steam Deck. It was then showcased by the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KCXxhD-Y8s" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deck Wizard</a> but now onto the drama…</p>
<p>The creator of lsfg-vk, "Pancake", <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1394103380787593277" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> this to the Lossless Scaling Discord server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important information regarding the Decky plugin and Deck Wizard's video</strong></p>
<p>A couple of hours ago Deck Wizard has made a video on Lossless Scaling in which they present a new Decky plugin for lsfg-vk.<br/>
On Reddit, the creator of that plugin claimed they had collaborated with me to create this, however this is incorrect and was likely the result of a language barrier.</p>
<p>I was asked to collaborate, but I instead requested them to wait with the plugin until the new configuration system was written, as otherwise a large portion of the plugin would have to be rewritten to account for it. They did not listen and pushed the plugin out without communicating with me beforehand.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the plugin already has many issues such as incorrect labeling of options and misleading descriptions of other options. Likely in collateral, the video created by Deck Wizard further spreads these wrong explanations. I want to clear up these things.<br/>
First of all, the settings recommended by Deck Wizard are 30% flow scale and no performance mode. I can not state enough how terrible these options are. With 30% flow scale, internal calculations are happening in 96x54 images with some going down to 2x1, producing extremely inaccurate results.<br/>
Instead, it is recommended to keep flow scale at 85-100% with performance mode enabled, as this gives a much larger performance boost while retaining immensely higher quality.</p>
<p>Clearly all of this is simply a result of poor communication and as such I will not support the Decky plugin. Do not ask about help with lsfg-vk when using the Decky plugin. Perhaps in the future an official lsfg-vk Decky plugin can be made in actual collaboration with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all seems a bit <em>dramatic</em>. But I don't blame the developer of the original Linux tool wanting things to be correct and ready for it to not be disappointing for users, and not to overwhelm them.</p>
<p>Hopefully this situation will have a happy ending.</p>

      <title>Open source Medal of Honor: Allied Assault adds better bots and a new master server for online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy some Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on modern systems with online play? OpenMoHAA is what you need to check out. Covered here initially on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/medal-of-honor-allied-assault-open-source-remake-gets-a-first-beta-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in November 2024</a>, the community project is quickly coming along with a whole lot of big improvements in the latest v0.82.0-beta release.</p>
<p>Some highlights of this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The navigation system has drastically improved for bots thanks to the Recast Navigation library. The mp-navigation pk3 file is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Docs have been reorganized and clarified. There is a new website for the documentation: <a href="https://docs.openmohaa.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.openmohaa.org/</a>.</li>
<li>On Windows there is now a setup file (MSI) to install OpenMoHAA.</li>
<li>Multiplayer server list has evolved!</li>
<li>Lot of fixes... Including some that address bugs present in the original game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bots are now a lot smarter and can navigate more difficult paths properly including those requiring jumping, falling or climbing ladders and navigating around obstacles. The most exciting addition though is the new master server powered by <a href="https://333networks.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">333networks</a>. With this update OpenMoHAA also now supports multiple master servers, and queries them all together to build the server list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9603253361752486752gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9603253361752486752gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMoHAA multiplayer on Linux</em></p>
<p>OpenMoHAA supports the full original game (including the campaigns) with support for modern systems. Along with plenty of modern enhancements.</p>
<p>You need the original game to work with it that you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy from GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>Running it on Linux is really easy. You can use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a> to download the game from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, then drop the release files from the OpenMoHAA GitHub into the installed folder and launch it.</p>

      <title>Split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS adds support for multiple keyboards and mice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PartyDeck is a free and open source split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS, and the latest release sounds great. I mentioned it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/partydeck-is-a-split-screen-game-launcher-for-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous GamingOnLinux article back in May</a>.</p>
<p>It allows you to run up to 4 instances of a game, supporting both Native Linux and Windows games via Proton. It sets it all up for you, with sandboxing to ensure each instance only sees the control inputs assigned to it and positions the game windows around your screen for you.</p>
<p>Pretty clever stuff, and now with the 0.5.0 release even supports multiple keyboards and mice. You can also now add multiple devices per instance, and there's been a few UI adjustments.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights from the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs up to 4 instances of a game at a time and automatically fits each game window onto the screen.</li>
<li>Supports native Linux games as well as Windows games through Proton.</li>
<li>Handler system that tells the launcher how to handle game files, meaning very little manual setup is required.</li>
<li>Steam multiplayer API is emulated, allowing for multiple instances of Steam games.</li>
<li>Works with most game controllers without any additional setup, drivers, or third-party software.</li>
<li>Now works with multiple keyboards and mice!</li>
<li>Uses sandboxing software to mask out controllers so that each game instance only detects the controller assigned to it, preventing input interference.</li>
<li>Profile support allows each player to have their own persistent save data, settings, and stats for games.</li>
<li>Works out of the box on SteamOS.</li>
</ul>

      <title>System76 reveal the new Adder WS laptop, their &#34;most affordable&#34; powerhouse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux hardware vendor and Pop!_OS Linux distribution developer System76 have revealed the Adder WS laptop, and it's quite powerful. If you're in need of new hardware and need something that has quite a kick, perhaps this may be what you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2981974521752484019gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's their "most affordable power-graphic's unit" but still with quite a cost attached at $2,099. Their press release noted it's a "light workstation laptop".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As standard it comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>15.6" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5050 (2560 CUDA Cores). Other options include:
	<ul>
<li>15.6" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5060 (3328 CUDA Cores).</li>
<li>17.3" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5060 (3328 CUDA Cores).</li>
<li>17.3" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5070 (4608 CUDA Cores).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, up to 5.4 GHz - 36MB cache - 36 TOPS - 24 total cores.</li>
<li>16 GB DDR5 5600 MHz.</li>
<li>1 TB PCIe4 (up to 5,000 MB/s read, 3,600 MB/s write).</li>
<li>WiFi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4.</li>
<li>Built-in Webcam &amp; Microphone.</li>
<li>1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type A), 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 (Type A), 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type C).</li>
<li>1x HDMI, 2x DisplayPort 2.1 over USB-C.</li>
<li>4 cell Polymer battery pack 73WH.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also made a rather silly Infomercial like the classics:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-9 released with NTSYNC and FSR4 upgrade support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 10-9 is out now with some exciting sounding new features like NTSYNC and FSR4 upgrade support for gamers on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is the community-made compatibility layer, not supported by Valve. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to install GE-Proton</a> for more.</p>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added ntsync support:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Enable with PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1</code></p>
<p>NOTES:<br/>
1. Your kernel must be patched with ntsync patches. If your system does not have /dev/ntsync then your kernel does not have the patches required to use ntsync.<br/>
2. Some applications, mostly 32 bit, may also need PROTON_USE_WOW64=1 when using ntsync</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added FSR4 upgrade support via PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=1 (auto upgrades from amd directly <a href="https://download.amd.com/dir/bin/amdxcffx64.dll" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://download.amd.com/dir/bin/amdxcffx64.dll</a>).</li>
<li>Added fixes from upstream for flicker/rendering issue when using wine-wayland.</li>
<li>Refactored a lot of the patches section and cleaned up outdated or merged patches.</li>
<li>Update wine-wayland patches.</li>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git.</li>
<li>Imported all upstream proton changes.</li>
<li>protonfixes: added a fix for winetricks wget gnutls failing inside fex.</li>
<li>protonfixes: add fix for sifu freeze (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10087377661752482846gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sifu</em></p>
<p>Before getting too excited about NTSYNC though, do note what Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned that I included in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux kernel 6.14 release post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already include fsync, which should be as fast or faster as ntsync. We developed ntsync as a general solution that'd be acceptable in upstream Wine, but there's no urgency in including it in the Deck / SteamOS kernel.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.12 brings EGL backend in the X11 driver, support for Bluetooth Low Energy services</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.12 is out now as the latest development release towards Wine 11, bringing new features and bug fixes for running Windows apps / games on Linux. <em>Wine is also a major part of Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as the highlights of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional EGL backend in the X11 driver.</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth Low Energy services.</li>
<li>More support for generating Windows Runtime metadata in WIDL.</li>
<li>ARM64 builds enabled in Gitlab CI.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a pretty old memory leak <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19561" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug</a> that was checked off with this release, from way back in 2009. Looks like it was actually fixed quite a few years ago. A fair amount of bugs that are noted with each Wine release aren't necessarily fixed with this specific version, it's just what bug reports they've gone over to see if they still happen. There's probably quite a lot of these older reports that still need checking given the size of the Wine project.</p>

      <title>DOGWALK is a free casual game from the Blender Studio out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Blender Studio team have now released DOGWALK, a free casual game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. A showcase of what's possible with free and open source tools.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://studio.blender.org/projects/dogwalk/production-logs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, their team put up various development logs you can read over to see how they got on with Godot. Originally they said "The goal of this project is to create a pipeline between Blender and Godot to make the asset and level creation process as seamless as possible".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gPENs56vfYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21dd1524375c087a7230460f37d4081f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gPENs56vfYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore - You are let loose to roam camping grounds, forest paths, idyllic creeks and a frozen pond in this miniature open world.</li>
<li>Bound together - Guide or drag around your little kid owner that you have in tow. Help each other out, be a menace or be a good boy.</li>
<li>Play your way - Dive straight in and have the game react to your play-style and choices. There are no fail states. Only player driven moments.</li>
<li>A paper craft world - Traverse an environment made of real-life paper crafted models, scanned and recreated to be played with.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code and various assets it's made with are also available, but you need to subscribe to Blender Studio to access all of it. The game itself is completely free though. You can also buy the Supporter Pack on Steam for the source code.</p>

      <title>Limbo and Inside are getting delisted from GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/limbo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/inside" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Inside</a> from studio Playdead are being delisted, so you might want to grab them while you can.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/delisting_limbo_and_inside/post1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> GOG made didn't go into details and just said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to inform you that Limbo and Inside will be removed from our store on July 17th, 2025, 3 PM CEST.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have any information on discounts yet.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could have better news for you, but grab it while it's still here!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? We can only speculate at this point but it's likely related to the ongoing legal spat between Playdead and co-founder Dino Patti.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5451388291752481194gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Inside from Playdead</em></p>
<p>Back in March, Patti <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dinopatti_dino-we-made-it-thats-what-he-told-activity-7303723474152230913-QJ9G/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on LinkedIn to note "My old partner has threatened me with an IP lawsuit because I used a publicly available picture, in a linkedin post 3 months ago, of the game LIMBO that we created at Playdead together" and that Patti would make it public if it continued (which it obviously did). The post showed the latest legal threat letter that Patti had received.</p>
<p>According to an article from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-playdead-has-filed-a-lawsuit-against-its-co-founder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>, Playdead followed up with an actual lawsuit against Patti in June.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated to fix the Epic Games Store and a few games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out a small update to Proton Experimental to begin the weekend, with fixes for the Epic Games Store and a few games for Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all the changes below for the July 11th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed experimental regressions:
	<ul>
<li>RiME should no longer exhibit weird windowing behavior when Alt+Tabbing on certain setups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed intro video in Warhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron - Flyboyz Edition having no audio.</li>
<li>Fixed Warrior Maiden Lecia and the Lost Fortress hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fixed video playback in Roboquest.</li>
<li>Fixed sending feedback not working in Cosmoteer: Starship Architect &amp; Commander.</li>
<li>Fixed Teardown hanging when publishing a mod to the workshop.</li>
<li>Fixed a recent update causing Epic Games Store not launching under Proton.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a></em></p>
<p>For anyone confused why Epic Games Store is noted it's because <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can install it using Proton inside of Steam</a>. I mentioned to Proton developers while working on that linked guide that it was broken, and it was fixed in the bleeding-edge Beta only a day later and now it's in Proton Experimental proper.</p>

      <title>Try having a shotgun for an arm in the demo for Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation is an upcoming retro-styled completely over the top FPS, it looks awesome and a demo is now live.</p>
<p>One I missed that was shown off during THE MIX event earlier this year. The game as a whole just sounds completely nuts. The developers own explanation of it is just ridiculous too. As they explain: "The hot pink-wearing, fish-chomping, cigar-huffing Captain Wayne refuses to let anything stand between him and his gory conquest to rob and humiliate every rich asshole around the globe."</p>
<p>You're also missing an arm, chomped away by a legendary "Vampire Whale" and so you replaced it for a shotgun. Now you're marooned, with your ship stolen and so off you set "annihilating everyone responsible".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3tNdGudqdCk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a9ca927e791002b2b3c9d6dba90df4e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3tNdGudqdCk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's actually using GZDoom, so you can most likely get it running in the Linux version of GZDoom. Otherwise, Proton is an option to try if you love your retro-fuelled shooters.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Witness an elaborately hand-drawn, action-packed epic inspired by the FPS greats!</li>
<li>Make use of the many devastating weapons in Wayne’s arsenal and achieve maximum destruction!</li>
<li>Explore dangerous locales through 8 humongous areas all across Orca Isle!</li>
<li>HALF GAME, HALF CARTOON! Delight in the Captain’s depth-defying tale in CAMPAIGN MODE as you view tons of animated cutscenes exploring his adventure.</li>
<li>Experience a high-octane soundtrack that emphasizes AGGRESSION and CHAOS!</li>
<li>Go for the gold in our ENDLESS MODE–how long can you survive the onslaught?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo is live on Steam now.</p>

      <title>SuperWEIRD is a co-op mixture of automation, tower defense and adventuring</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SuperWEIRD is the next planned game from developers Luden.io, merging together a few different genres into something thoroughly odd.</p>
<p>Even the developer is confused about it. As they said: "We want to cross tower-defense gameplay with co-op and automation, and see what comes out of this mix. You find yourself in a place that's obviously broken. The local store is closed, the robots are malfunctioning, and there are occasional golem attacks in the wilderness. This all sounds SuperWEIRD, so... Good luck?"</p>
<p>In the game you will open up your own store, and then gather resources to craft goods to sell to the locals. While also fending off thieving robots. The developer previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">while True: learn()</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1724140/Craftomation_101/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Craftomation 101</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150090/Learning_Factory/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Learning Factory</a> so of course there's a little programming involved with helper bots (but all simple - no coding skills required they say).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwIWbkia6V0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8012af773e8809f52ea034e232f81d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwIWbkia6V0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use flags to mark paths for an endless stream of mindless robots.</li>
<li>Make them harvest resources and craft stuff for you.</li>
<li>Arm your robots, or even better: make robots arm other robots.</li>
<li>Build and optimize huge and complex systems of robots.</li>
<li>Play with friends in co-op mode to make things better… or much worse.</li>
<li>Outsmart the madness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly educational too. It's being developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.carina.fund/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Carina Initiatives</a>, a nonprofit philanthropic foundation working on building a deep and connected math talent ecosystem.</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation for Linux gets upgraded to the latest v3.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The dev of the popular Lossless Scaling app has been helping the lsfg-vk project that brings Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation to Linux to get it upgraded. Quite exciting news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lsfg-vk-aims-to-bring-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-to-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux shared recently</a>, and progress on improving it has been ongoing.</p>
<p>Writing in the official Discord for Lossless Scaling, the developer behind the lsfg-vk project noted how they've had help from the original Lossless Scaling developer THS behind the scenes. Thanks to their help lsfg-vk has now been updated to support LSFG 3.1 (the latest version of LSFG).</p>
<p>As developer Pancake said on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1393003249224777858" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update to LSFG 3.1</strong></p>
<p>As promised the new version of lsfg-vk is updated to use LSFG 3.1, making it both faster and better!<br/>
When updating, make sure you change the branch on Steam back to the normal release branch.</p>
<p>This new release also brings with it the <code class="inline-code">LSFG_FLOW_SCALE</code> property, which can be used to override the flow scale from 1.0 (100%) down to 0.25 (25%). If you're encountering performance issues, you might want to consider lowering this option. Performance mode not yet supported unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the updates there's now a new LSFG 3.1 Benchmark you can use with instructions added to <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki/Configuring-lsfg%E2%80%90vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Installing it should be a little bit easier now too, as the developer also announced they've enabled a GitHub workflow to build binaries constantly. However, it builds on Arch Linux so will only work on Arch-based systems. They've also made an installation script too but it still needs further testing and expanding to support more distributions.</p>
<p>Over time, as more people use it and help with it, I expect it to get a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>You can get it on <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for Linux but you do need to own Lossless Scaling on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Craft-and-thrive adventure Squirreled Away tweaks the graphics for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Squirreled Away is a cute casual craft-and-thrive adventure that you can play solo or with friends, and now it should work great out of the box on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Checking off the last thing on the list to get it bumped up from Playable to Verified, the developers have implemented new graphics options with a default for the Steam Deck to perform better. Manually configuring it was why Valve gave it a Playable rating, so it's likely now it can be Steam Deck Verified with a big green tick. It's also SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>The developers also "significantly" lowered the CPU and GPU usage while in the main menu. As for content there's also some new stuff in this update. They added in the "Telly-porter", a TV that allows you to transport between places which sounds pretty great.</p>
<p>Not seen it before? It's super cute. Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Rotate and unfold the world in the wonderful 3D platformer PaperKlay - now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible! PaperKlay is a gorgeous 3D platformer collect-a-thon with a world made of paper, cardboard and clay.</p>
<p>There's so many great games releasing that I miss quite a lot of them. But, sifting through Steam Deck announcements helps me surface some real gems like this. It features a catchy soundtrack with tracks from composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee) and Steven Melin (Dark Dice, Moonlighter) along with a surprising voice cast. Some of the voices you might recognise from the likes of Sly Cooper, Five Nights at Freddy's, Attack on Titan &amp; more.</p>
<p>After the May 27th release, the developer WhyKev put out a bunch of patches and thanks to all the work it has been rated Verified by Valve as of July 8th.</p>

      <title>Stress-testing app OCCT switches to Vulkan by default dropping DirectX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular stress-testing app OCCT <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/stress-testing-toolkit-occt-arrives-on-steam-with-linux-and-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently landed on Steam</a>, and the first major update here swaps DirectX for Vulkan by default.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Explaining their reasoning they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3515100/announcements/detail/499451286721140342" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why?<br/>
- On Linux, OpenCL support is optional, and finding which OpenCL adapter corresponds to which in DirectX is particularly challenging, making it hard to tell which adapter from one API matches the one reported by another.<br/>
- On Windows, maintaining a separate DirectX rendering path added unnecessary complexity.<br/>
<br/>
And Vulkan gives us:<br/>
- A unified GPU detection algorithm across platforms<br/>
- A simpler, more robust codebase<br/>
- Slightly better performance and even more accurate results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like it makes sense for them, simplifies things overall since Vulkan supports both platforms they currently support. Nice to see Vulkan making inroads with more developers and not just in games. They explain a bit more in the video below:</p>

      <title>Unrailed! gets fixed for Steam Deck and an update for controllers on Linux / macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unrailed! from Indoor Astronaut is a great co-op multiplayer game that's good fun with friends, and now works properly on Steam Deck / Linux again.</p>
<p>Specifically, they fixed up the Native Linux version of the game, which was having problems crashing with the latest SteamOS release. Valve actually rated the game Verified with the Native version being the default. They've also updated the version of SDL they use which they said "should solve several issues where controllers could not get recognized".</p>
<p>I did a play-through only recently with family, and had to end up using Proton as the Native version just wouldn't work. Nice to see it properly fixed out of the box now. While it's good that the option was there it's still quite annoying to see a Verified game just suddenly broken like that. Once again, Proton saved the day. At least in this case, the Native version is still actively supported by the developer.</p>

      <title>First-person horror platformer Blessed Burden adds Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First-person platforming with a dose of horror? Sounds interesting! Blessed Burden recently added Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>In the game you play as the "last priest" as you descend deeper into "the deepest depths to destroy the very essence of evil" as you avoid traps, lava and fear itself. There's no need to rush in this one, how you play it is entirely up to you. You can go fast and aggressive or slow and steady while you take in the atmosphere and lore. With a skill upgrade system, you'll gradually get access to improve various movement skills.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LOQAs0XKFo0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0d8e23264b010ae914bbdc3cae046fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LOQAs0XKFo0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Originally released on June 18th, the Linux and Steam Deck support came in with the July 9th update. This update also added Steam Input support, the ability to race against your own ghost character and various quality of life improvements.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>10 levels – from mushroom caves to brutalist megastructures.</li>
<li>1.5 hours for a first playthrough.</li>
<li>Horror-infused religious atmosphere.</li>
<li>Deconstructivist, brutalist, and infernal architecture.</li>
<li>Retro visuals with a modern flair.</li>
<li>Unique soundtrack – a fusion of church choirs, ritual percussion, and industrial sound.</li>
<li>Devil’s suspenseful monologues.</li>
<li>Movement skill upgrade system.</li>
<li>Leaderboard – compete with other players in level completion speed.</li>
<li>Collecting infernal relics.</li>
<li>Sliding on colossal roots.</li>

      <title>Raid an abandoned Soviet R&amp;D Institute in the single-player extraction shooter Red Light</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With intense action, Red Light is a single-player extraction shooter not to be missed if you love your retro-styled shooters. It originally launched back in June which I missed and just recently had an update that should improve the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: "You are Max, on a mission to find your missing brother. Your only lead takes you to an old Soviet R&amp;D Institute, now taken over by mercenaries and creepy results of human experiments. Fight your way through enemies, complete quests, and go deeper underground with each level. The more you explore, the more secrets you uncover about what really happened here. Gear up, stay sharp, and get ready for a dangerous journey into the unknown."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fight against monsters, mercenaries and bosses as you head into an abandoned mega structure.</li>
<li>Search every corner for useful gear, supplies, and valuables. Everything you find can help you survive — or be sold later for profit.</li>
<li>Stock up on food, water, ammo, and meds. Once you are inside, you are on your own until exits open. Complete tasks, find better gear and upgrade your stats to improve your chances for the next raid.</li>
<li>Make it to the exfil point to keep your loot — or die and lose everything you found and brought with you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The developer sent over advanced access to the upcoming Steam Playtest, which you can apply for now to begin on July 17th. If you like a challenge and deckbuilders, this is one you're likely to find really interesting. The developer is planning full Native Linux and Steam Deck support too (which already worked great in my testing).</p>
<p>More about it: "Clear your fields, plant crops strategically, and protect them from wild weather. Combine quirky scarecrows and their powerful passive effects to create satisfying combos. Build your deck of plants — and don’t forget to pay taxes, because Sir Landlord always comes for his share! All wrapped in a wholesome and charming package."</p>

<p>What to expect in the Playtest? A small but "juicy slice" of what's planned for the full game. The developer said to expect about 2 hour of gameplay.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go to the Steam page and tap the "Request Access" button when logged in.</p>

      <title>Oblivion Remastered v1.2 gets a Beta with lots of fixes and optimisations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is getting quite a big update soon, with version 1.2 now in Beta on Steam.</p>
<p>As usual for a Bethesda game, it came with lots of issues but with their partners at Virtuos they've been clearly busy trying to make it a worthy game to fully play through. The majority of the update is fixing up bugs players have encountered, along with adding in some additional difficulty settings to tweak your experience. However, they've also done various optimisations to improve performance too - so perhaps it might actually deserve that Steam Deck Verified rating eventually.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6040624611752149542gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Try the big demo update for Dicey Bugs, a turn-based deckbuilder where you control both sides</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dicey Bugs is a roguelike, turn-based deckbuilder where you control both sides of the battles. A new demo is live now woth support for Linux and Windows. In the 2.0 demo update the developer has added in the ability to save, new content and various fixes but it only scratches the surface of what will be in the full release due out later this year.</p>
<p>I like the mixture of features this one has that blends genres together. It's a deck-builder, but your deck is built up from creatures that you can collect from the battles.</p>
<p>Check out their initial trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T3YD_Dest9U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30c5a040d6177c0bb06a574ec331b440.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T3YD_Dest9U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it, some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take command of turn-based battles by strategically deciding when to play both your dice and your enemy’s, shaping the outcome of each turn.</li>
<li>Capture weakened foes during battle to recruit them into your current party or save them for future runs.</li>
<li>Build your party from recruited units and modify your starting dice for countless strategic possibilities.</li>
<li>Optimize your party's effectiveness by chaining abilities and using complementary equipment.</li>
<li>Upgrade your units and customize your dice by unlocking rewards and spending coins at the shop.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Chilled dino ranching game Paleo Pines is crowdfunding for a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paleo Pines released back in September 2023 and it's set for a big free update, but the developer is gathering the needed funds on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Speaking about why they needed a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paleopines/paleo-pines-players-choice" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund it they said that while it has been a success in terms of reception and reach, the reality is that the financial benefits have "primarily gone to our publishers" — ouch. Most of their funding to keep going has been via merchandise like plushies. They go on to note how funding for "independent developers have been drying up at an alarming rate", with no other publishers jumping in to boost it.</p>
<p>And so they're trying a Kickstarter for the update. Seems it was a good idea with it hitting £101,143 at time of writing against their original £75,000 goal. So the free update is funded for all players of the game, with extra funding now going towards even more new features to come.</p>
<p>See the original launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pKD9XKRkiMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/060eb9d7540648ecdb8de410bccc6613.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pKD9XKRkiMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What will the update actually add in? They plan to add the Spinosaurus, more dream stones, a new shooting stars system and significant performance optimisations at a minimum. With other additions if they manage to pull in even more funding like a big new swamp biome. </p>
<p>The base game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>STEEL HUNTERS is another live service casualty as it&#39;s shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STEEL HUNTERS from Wargaming Group only arrived on Steam in April, and it's already going to be shut down by the developers.</p>
<p>The Early Access title from the developers of World of Warships and World of Tanks just didn't hit the mark. Looking at player counts on Steam, it dropped pretty rapidly after the initial release to well below 1,000 concurrent players in that same month. Its all-time peak was only 4,479, so for such a game it never really lived.</p>
<p>Writing in Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the servers will remain only for 90 days along with adding custom game support for the remaining time. They said it's simply "not sustainable" to continue developing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2517395081752057321gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They had some stiff competition with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/mecha-break-is-out-now-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-blocks-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mecha BREAK</a>, which sadly doesn't work on Desktop Linux but does on Steam Deck due to the annoying <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>.</p>
<p>STEEL HUNTERS was rated Steam Deck Playable and worked on Desktop Linux with Proton. </p>

      <title>MR FARMBOY is like Stardew Valley but with automation and optimization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming to Early Access later in July, MR FARMBOY blends elements of Stardew Valley with automation and optimisation. Sounds like it could be a fun idea and you can try this early too as there's a demo available.</p>
<p>It has all the usual elements you would expect from a more casual farming game like resource gathering, planting and selling crops, animal husbandry, constructing various buildings and more. Where it differs from others in the genre are the automation systems. You can hire workers to automate various tasks, as you build bigger and expand and eventually attempt to optimise and automate everything.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="45zSAIe7p0I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7326de35ad9ca42909dc0ea44f21e419.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/45zSAIe7p0I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Could be an interesting one.</p>
<p>The Steam release is currently planned for July 23rd to begin Early Access. According to what the developer said it will only be in there for a few months while they add some more content including more buildings, new crops, new resources, objectives and so on.</p>

      <title>Operation Octo is an upcoming frantic aquatic Tower Defense with big boss fights</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a fresh Tower Defense game to try out? Here's another tip for you! Operation Octo arrives in September with a chance to try it early.</p>
<p>One that should perhaps be a bit on the different side as the developer explained: "It is a Tower Defense Game that incorporates Bullet Hell and Plants vs. Zombies in terms of gameplay and aesthetics". You fend off hordes of skeletons by placing down sea creatures to fight them off. Over time your defense line may fall, resulting in turning into a game of survival when you're running for your life.</p>
<p>It just had a big demo update over the weekend too. Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oQ-3gOKMqNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bad5d06c3b91da8faa416c52b3d1d2c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oQ-3gOKMqNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock Turrets: Your arsenal is filled with mechanized sea lives! Those cool inventions (such as Pistol Shrimp, Navy Seal, and Death Ray) will handle the fight. You’ll discover new turret types one after another - Figure out how best to utilize each of ‘em!</li>
<li>Skeleton Enemies: Did you know that most humans who ever lived are dead? Tons of skeletons end up in the ocean, and are terrorizing local ecosystems. Fight sword-swinging pirates, poison-wielding chemists, and even skeletal dragons… Those skeletons are sure to shake up your playstyle at every turn!</li>
<li>Unique Biomes: As you adventure the seven seas, you’ll add more creatures into your turret collection, and face new and exciting dangers. Adapting to changing environments is key to survival: Don’t misstep into a toxic brine pool, or forget your light in the darkness of the deep sea.</li>
<li>Turret Upgrades: Skeletons will sometimes drop a variety of Elixirs. Use them to boost turrets into different forms! Will you turn a turret into a frosty ice machine, a powerful mutant, or a shadowy stealth weapon?</li>
<li>Boss Fights: Special levels featuring larger-than-life boss enemies with formidable abilities!</li>
<li>Awesome Upbeat Soundtrack: Seriously, the composers are amazing</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer mentioned they've mostly made it solo too while in College.</p>

      <title>Vehicle No. 4 has you build your own vehicle in this horde survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo live on Steam, Vehicle No. 4 could be one to watch if you love your horde survival games with you building your own vehicle. So it's perhaps a little like a top-down 2D version of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/terratech-legion-could-be-the-best-survivor-like-ever-with-vehicle-building/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TerraTech Legion</a>.</p>
<p>You get to freely place weapons and upgrade them with unique models as you face ever-increasing challenges. There's no points for style in this one, it's all about building the ultimate horde-smashing machine. Nice to see more slightly unique takes on this whole genre explosion thanks to Vampire Survivors. With the smaller areas, it looks much more like an arena-battler like Brotato too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i_BYd_VKbks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ce67f11f0267040e68be33485a28bde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i_BYd_VKbks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Vehicle No. 4  is coming sometime soon in August to Early Access.</p>
<p>I'll be keeping an eye on it for the Early Access release as I continue my quest to play everything in this horde smashing genre. Something about it has me hooked, much like Pokemon I have to <s>catch</s> play them all.</p>

      <title>In Silence Waits is an upcoming modern take on classic graphical adventures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Older readers might be interested in this one. Silent Shoals Software announced In Silence Waits, a modern take on classic graphical adventures.</p>
<p>They previously released The Aching back in 2023. With this being a follow-up in the same setting. With the game driven by a combination of arrow keys and parser input, In Silence Waits continues The Aching‘s "precedent of a methodical approach to adventure games".</p>
<p>More about it: "Having been dropped off before a forgotten landmark in the midst of a sheltered canyon, you’ll guide this bard through dangers untold as he searches for a passage to this rare city of peace. You’ll meet several creatures along the way, both friendly and fearsome: some looking for kinship, others for a quick meal. So be wary, traveler! Aid comes in all shapes and sizes, but so does danger. In this world, not all monsters must be feared, and not all friendly faces should be trusted."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5312396201752052205gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This isn't just a retro looking adventure, it's built to be retro too but with some modern touches. Talking about the software behind it they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine behind <em>In Silence Waits</em>, first developed for <em>The Aching</em>, is 100% backwards compatible with PCs all the way back to the original IBM 5160 and the Tandy 1000, with optional support for CGA 4-color graphics, VGA 256 color graphics, and a variety of era appropriate audio devices including the Roland MT-32, General MIDI, and even the Sound Blaster and Adlib sound cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the PC release (with Linux support) they noted it's using DOSBox Staging.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered gets a new way to play - chronologically</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the developers of The Last of Us Part II Remastered still suggest you play it the original way, now you can play it chronologically.</p>
<p>Originally and as the default, the game is told in a non-linear way with it mixing together various flashbacks and present-day story-lines. They said the structure of it is "very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II’s themes and narrative beats to impact players". This new mode instead sticks it all along a linear timeline so it flows a bit more naturally together that they believe "players will gain even deeper insight into Part II's narrative".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20580189071752051457gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Available as a free update there's also UNCHARTED-themed skins of Joel and Tommy added as well, which you can unlock by playing the new Chronological mode.</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the new Chronological mode.</li>
<li>Introduced UNCHARTED-themed skins for Joel and Tommy as reward for completing Chronological mode.</li>
<li>Implemented achievements and trophies related to Chronological mode.</li>
<li>Dynamic blood drips now appear as expected for higher framerates up to 160 FPS.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where dynamic blood drips would stop appearing upon restarting an encounter.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that stopped dynamic blood drips to appear when disabling the Full Screen Effects setting.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where animations of some gore effects were missing when using a finishing melee attack on human enemies.</li>
<li>Hair and cloth movement physics now also function correctly at framerates above 100 FPS.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the weapon HUD would occasionally not appear at a framerate of 80 FPS or higher.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused players to be unable to shoot with a bow on their first attempt after clicking "Restart Checkpoint" with the mouse.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Permadeath Completion or Speedrun Recap to not appear after completing the Story in Permadeath Mode or Speedrun Mode.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where the boat’s haptic feedback was missing during a cinematic of ‘The Island’ chapter.</li>
<li>Added a new credits sequence specific to PC release.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes related to ultrawide cinematics.</li>
<li>Various localization text related updates and corrections.</li>
<li>Various accessibility bug fixes.</li>
<li>Stability improvements.</li>
<li>Performance optimizations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam now has a UI scaling slider and accessibility menu on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Valve continue updating Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-update-brings-accessibility-settings-and-proton-enabled-by-default-to-make-linux-gaming-simpler/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with better accessibility options</a>, the latest Beta makes it super easy to make Steam bigger (or smaller). The single change for the July 8th Steam Desktop Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545613182900637815" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> it "Added a UI scale slider to desktop accessibility settings".</p>
<p>Nice to see for those who need to adjust the Steam UI:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7965105351752049696gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's still some quirks they need to work out. One I found is that when you increase the UI size, the settings page window pictured above expands to fit all the text. But when you reduce the size, the window <em>stays</em> bigger. Minor issue I'm sure they'll solve soon.</p>
<p>A day before on July 7th, that Accessibility menu on Steam Desktop was added as part of a slightly larger set of fixes and improvements for the desktop client. A lot of it focusing on the new In-Game Overlay that doesn't have proper Linux support yet (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you should use MangoHud</a>).</p>
<p>July 7th <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545613182900637419" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added an accessibility settings menu to desktop, featuring high contrast and reduced motion settings.</li>
<li>Added accessibility annotations to many UI components.</li>
</ul>
<strong>In-Game Overlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed fonts and UI in the overlay being somewhat fuzzy, aligned unevenly, or appearing over anti-aliased for users with Display Scale (DPI) &gt; 100%.</li>
<li>Implement DPI scaling of Performance Monitor display (if you have &gt; 100% display scale, your size will change on update and you may need to adjust it again, this should be a one time inconvenience).</li>
<li>Fixed a case where FPS vs DLSS numbers could be incorrect in some games loading DLSS modules.</li>
<li>Fix some cases where numeric labels in the Performance Monitor display could cut off their last digit when drawing.</li>
<li>Fixed Performance Monitor hot-key changes while in-game not immediately taking effect.</li>
<li>Performance improvement for Vulkan overlay rendering (most obvious when Performance Monitor FPS chart rendering).</li>
<li>Performance improvement for Open GL overlay rendering in games using the Open GL shader pipeline (again most obvious when Performance Monitor FPS chart rendering, this fix doesn't impact old games using the Open GL fixed function pipeline).</li>
<li>Fixed Performance Monitor rendering on macOS if certain fonts are not available.</li>
<li>Fixed overlay background not extending to full game window dimensions at some aspect ratios.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed 8BitDo controller guide button showing the Xbox logo.</li>
<li>Fixed page shift when scrolling through link buttons on game details page.</li>
<li>Fixed achievement presentation in app activity feed and post-game summary panels.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added support for analog activators on d-pad modes for joysticks and trackpads.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced stutter when a Remote Play client with many shortcuts becomes available for streaming.</li>
</ul>
<strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix game info panel not animating open on game details page.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For SteamOS / Steam Deck these are the latest updates across the two Betas:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added accessibility annotations to many UI components.</li>
<li>Show screen reader shortcut in accessibility settings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed 8BitDo controller guide button showing the Xbox logo.</li>

      <title>AMD CPU Transient Scheduler Attacks security flaw revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made public today is a fresh round of security issues, this time for AMD CPUs with Transient Scheduler Attacks. It affects quite a lot of processors including desktop, mobile and data centre.</p>
<p>From AMD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD discovered several transient scheduler attacks related to the execution timing of instructions under specific microarchitectural conditions while investigating a Microsoft report titled "<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/enter-exit-page-fault-leak-testing-isolation-boundaries-for-microarchitectural-leaks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Enter, Exit, Page Fault, Leak: Testing Isolation Boundaries for Microarchitectural Leaks</a>".</p>
<p>AMD has debugged these patterns and identified a speculative side channel affecting AMD CPUs . In some cases, an attacker may be able to use this timing information to infer data from other contexts, resulting in information leakage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some CPUs will not be getting updates for any of the issues or only for some, as AMD note some issues do "not result in leakage of sensitive information" but that depends on the exact processor series.</p>
<p>The CVEs are noted below:</p>
<div class="scrolling-table">

<td>5.6 (Medium) AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N</td>

<p>Some of the updates for the Linux kernel were merged in recently, so hopefully distributions will get the changes out for updates quickly.</p>

      <title>Rhythm of Resistance is the &#34;world&#39;s first&#34; rhythm metroidvania</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not entirely sure if their announcement of it being the "world's first" truly holds up, but I can't say I've seen anything like Rhythm of Resistance.</p>
<p>The game is expected to arrive sometime in 2026 so it's a while away but the trailer grabbed my firm attention. The way you use the tunes as your weapon to change your surroundings, enemy behaviour, reveal hidden paths and solve puzzles certainly sounds like music to my ears.</p>
<p>With music being the key feature here they've pulled in the Swedish bands ABU NEIN along with Underground Fire. With more to be announced as the game development goes on. Joel Fjällsby, Founder &amp; Creative Director at Nethermoon Game Studio said, "I wanted the music to be real songs with lyrics and everything. Like an old track you could actually find on a forgotten cassette tape. With this in mind, I reached out to bands that felt like a great fit — and everyone so far has fallen in love with the project."</p>

      <title>The big Diplomacy Update for X4: Foundations is now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Diplomacy Update for X4: Foundations is now in Beta bringing some huge new features to the popular space sim. It's an opt-in Beta with a password, details on accessing it are available on <a href="https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&amp;t=405397" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their forum</a>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Diplomacy is the biggest feature addition in this upcoming release. You get a whole new Embassy Room to deal with various faction diplomats. There's also the new Agents class of NPCs to hire to help with negotiation or espionage that you can send off on a range of operations. Starting off with two agents, they have their own experience system to level up and specialise.</p>
<p>Egosoft say the biggest most game-changing addition is that you can "now trigger and influence dynamic diplomatic standing between NPC factions" which can have an "extraordinary impact on the galaxy, as alliances, trade partners and supply chains shift".</p>
<p>Sounds like a sweet update.</p>

      <title>Bazzite gets a new app store, newly supported devices, improved WiFi and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular Linux gaming image Bazzite has a July 2025 update out with some interesting new features and expanded device support.</p>
<p>For new devices the ASUS ROG Z13 2025 is now fully supported along with the ONEXPLAYER X1 Mini Pro too. There's also a Linux kernel version bump to 6.15.4, with a few of their own fixes added in for hardware support.</p>
<p>One addition that sounds quite interesting is the new WiFi service IWD (iNet Wireless Daemon) from Intel, which can solve various issues they listed including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic WIFI scanning causing latency jumps/freezes while streaming games (e.g., Sunshine).</li>
<li>Slower WIFI compared to Windows on mesh networks.</li>
<li>Network dropouts in busy areas or under dense mesh networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not enabled by default though.</p>
<p>A big change for Bazzite's Desktop Mode is the new app store named Bazaar. It has a pure focus on Flatpak, so it's a good fit for projects like Bazzite. They said it allows them to directly curate recommendations too, it has better performance than other app stores and they've tweaked it to remove certain Flatpaks like Steam that would cause problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20114925781751967960gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20114925781751967960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>I definitely need to personally get Bazzite installed on something soon. I've been planning to build a living room SteamOS box for a while, I just need to push myself to actually do it.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31.1.0 released with Multitrack Video for Linux, explicit sync support for PipeWire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio 31.1.0 is out now with various new features and improvements, and it's a nice release for Linux users too.</p>
<p>This release finally includes support for Multitrack Video on Linux, otherwise known as Enhanced Broadcasting on Twitch. This feature enables you to send multiple video qualities to your streaming platform, since they don't guarantee they will do it for you to give viewers different quality options.</p>
<p>For Linux this release also adds explicit sync support for PipeWire Screen Capture, this should ensure all graphics drivers get good capture performance and accuracy. There's more goodies for Linux to like a hardware accelerated browser source (not supported on NVIDIA yet) and a few bug fixes.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.14 Beta brings wake-on-bluetooth back to the Steam Deck LCD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released SteamOS 3.7.14 Beta, which for Steam Deck LCD owners is probably going to be popular as it brings back wake-on-bluetooth. This is still experimental though, after it was entirely disabled in the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steamos-3-7-13-update-gets-fixes-for-more-handhelds-fixes-wifi-regression-on-steam-deck-oled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7.13 release</a> following from being enabled in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial SteamOS 3.7 release</a>.</p>
<p>That is the only change for this SteamOS Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD, including support for LE peripherals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/529850584204840829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve</a></p>
<p>To try it out you need to be in the Beta or Preview channel. You can opt in via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3628861261751918948gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Even Valve appear to be getting confused by their own version numbers at this point too. As we had the SteamOS 3.17.3 stable release and the SteamOS 3.7.13 Beta that were somehow separate, but now we're up to SteamOS 3.7.14 so back to normal.</p>
<p>My LCD Steam Deck since the 3.7.13 Beta has also been doing the repeating issue of showing me the same update available again, which Valve were <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-deck-steamos-will-now-stop-bugging-you-to-install-updates-multiple-times/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supposed to have solved</a> previously. Hopefully with the 3.7.14 Beta it will stop doing it again.</p>

      <title>Adorable Adventures is a gorgeous upcoming adventure featuring a mischievous baby boar</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aww. Adorable Adventures is just the kind of game I needed to see today, one that's going right up on my wishlist. From French developer Wild Sheep Studio, who previously worked on the VR orchestra conducting rhythm game Maestro.</p>
<p>More about it: "Adorable Adventures is a cozy third-person exploration game where you play as Boris, a curious baby boar who has to learn how to use his nose to reunite his family after a forest fire. From peaceful forest meadows, rocky highlands, dark caves to sun-dappled paths, use your nose to follow trails, uncover secrets, make friends and expand your library of smells."</p>
<p>Reminds me a bit of the Shelter series. Check out the announce trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a mischievous baby boar.</li>
<li>A deep and innovative scent-tracking mechanic.</li>
<li>An interactive herbarium to complete.</li>

<li>A collection of playful activities to compete in.</li>

      <title>shapez 2 is aiming for the 1.0 update in November with a new game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is a wonderfully chilled factory building sim that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/chilled-factory-builder-shapez-2-gets-a-massive-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a huge upgrade</a>, and hopefully in November it will be ready for the full release.</p>
<p>The developer put out a new devlog going over some plans which includes an aim for the 1.0 release in November, but they're not currently guaranteeing that date. That 1.0 update is planned to have achievements and modding support, along with a new game mode that might replace the current default.</p>
<p>For the new game mode they're aiming to address a common player complaint - needing to tear things down that are no longer needed. Their focus with the new mode is to make things more permanent, where the early building still has a place in the later stages of the game. Even when this gets added, the original mode will still be there but possibly renamed "Classic".</p>
<p>Check out the previous update trailer if you missed it:</p>

<p>Even when the hit the 1.0 and leave Early Access, updates won't stop. They "already have a lot of plans and ideas for post 1.0".</p>

      <title>Palworld is now Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the latest updates to the popular Palworld, Valve have now bumped it up to Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>The rating has been a bit up and down with it going <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/while-palworld-enjoys-a-resurgence-valve-dropped-the-rating-to-steam-deck-unsupported/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsupported in January</a>, and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-set-palworld-back-as-steam-deck-playable-but-with-multiple-listed-problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back to Playable</a> a day later. Now that it's rated Verified, Valve appear satisfied it no longer has any of these problems below that they listed previously:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some functionality is not accessible when using the default controller configuration, requiring use of the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or a community configuration.</li>
<li>This game sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
<li>Some in-game text is small and may be difficult to read.</li>
<li>This game requires manual configuration of graphics settings to perform well on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>This game does not default to external Bluetooth/USB controllers on Deck, and may require manually switching the active controller via the Quick Access Menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they do note one issue it still has, which is that it doesn't default to external controllers on Steam Deck so you need to change the controller order from the Quick Access menu.

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers adds real-time Steam shortcuts and teases upcoming Steam integration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is a tool you can use on Linux / SteamOS to automatically set up various third-party stores. A new release brings new tricks.</p>
<p>The app works with Epic Games, GOG, EA, Amazon, Battle.net and lots of others. It uses GE-Proton to install the Windows version of all the apps you pick and then adds it to Steam for you to easily launch (useful for SteamOS / Steam Deck).</p>
<p>NonSteamLaunchers v4.2.2 is out now adding real-time shortcuts, so you no longer need to reload Steam to have things actually show up. The developer has also teased that proper Steam integration is coming in Desktop Mode with this image:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2688251571751907010gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's useful but it does bundle everything into one single Proton prefix, which could cause issues but should mostly work fine.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s now easier to get Mesa 25.1 on the latest Ubuntu 25.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to upgrade Mesa on Ubuntu, Kubuntu and other Ubuntu-based distributions? It's now a bit easier thanks to a PPA update to get Mesa 25.1 installed. <em>See more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my Linux graphics driver guide</a>.</em></p>
<p>One of the best ways for a while now has been the PPAs from kisak, like the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kisak/+archive/ubuntu/kisak-mesa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">kisak-mesa fresh PPA</a>. However, until recently it was not supported on the latest Ubuntu distros due to storage limits on PPAs.</p>
<p>Recently, kisak retired support for older Ubuntu versions like Bionic (18.04), Focal (20.04) and Jammy (22.04). So now if you're on a more recent version like Ubuntu 25.04 you can finally use it and get Mesa 25.1. Specifically, it has the very latest bug-fix release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/mesa-25-1-5-brings-more-bug-fixes-for-linux-graphics-drivers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mesa 25.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>This is going to be needed too, because the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/direct3d-to-vulkan-layer-dxvk-v2-7-released-with-performance-improvements-and-intel-support-upgrades/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest DXVK update</a> actually now recommends Mesa 25.1. So soon a Proton update that pulls in that DXVK version will run better with it.</p>
<p>I do suggest you read the PPA page first as it notes Oracular (24.10) and Plucky (25.04) have not been tested locally by kisak. Using it on an Ubuntu distro is easy by running these terminal commands below:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa</code></p>
<p>And then:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt update</code></p>
<p>I've tested it myself this morning using this PPA on Kubuntu 25.04 running around in Dune: Awakening and it's all looking good.</p>

      <title>lsfg-vk aims to bring Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Lossless Scaling</a> is a very popular application for Windows, and the new lsfg-vk project aims to bring Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation to Linux.</p>
<p>It's a new project and very much in-development, so parts may not work as expected. The developer has been rapidly fixing issues as they come in.</p>
<p>The installation process is a bit involved though, so you need to be pretty Linux-comfortable right now to actually make use of it as it's quite a manual process. You also need to have purchased Lossless Scaling on Steam, and it makes use of a legacy version.</p>
<p>Hopefully now it has been revealed, more Linux hackers can jump in and improve the process for everyone.</p>
<p>On the GitHub Wiki the developer posted up on how they actually achieved it, which is really interesting if you love the technical side of how people do things. Like the "<a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki/Porting-LSFG-to-native-Vulkan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Porting LSFG to native Vulkan</a>" article that mentions the "psychological torture" the dev went through "to make this project work".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">find it on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Video Games Europe release a statement on Stop Killing Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Video Games Europe, a trade association that represents a bunch of major game publishers, have issued a statement pushing back against Stop Killing Games. We just recently had the news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/stop-killing-games-consumer-movement-hits-some-major-milestones/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games has been seeing a huge surge</a>, so a lot more are taking notice of it.</p>
<p>VGE represents the likes of Activision Blizzard King, Bandai Namco, Epic Games, ESL FACEIT Group, Netflix, Nintendo, SEGA, Roblox, Ubisoft, Riot Games and many others.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's their full <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly<strong> </strong>and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>
<p>We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>It's perhaps <em>no</em> surprise they're not in favour of it. It is their job to serve the interests of game publishers and other companies they're involved with.</p>
<p>The thing is, from a consumer point of view you are paying for something that can just be taken away whenever a publisher moves on from it. Stop Killing Games is <em>not</em> asking for publishers to infinitely support games, as shutting off their own direct support is not something that's trying to be stopped. But simply giving players an option to continue it themselves is the main argument.</p>
<p>Complicated though, since every store (yes, including GOG) are just giving you a <em>license</em>. You <em>don't</em> own the games you buy.</p>
<p>When it comes to private servers, I can somewhat understand what they're saying. They can be a minefield of legal issues, and with all the new regulations coming in from various countries like the UK's Online Safety Act, running a private server is getting a <em>lot</em> more complicated too. Because yes, games that have chat and interactions are in scope of it and regulations from other countries too.</p>
<p>This comes in around the same time as EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcing</a> that Anthem is going to be shutting down, with players no longer able to jump in from January 12 2026.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan layer DXVK v2.7 released with performance improvements and Intel support upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK v2.7 was released over the weekend with lots of improvements for the Direct3D to Vulkan layer. Here's what's new and improved.</p>
<p>For driver support, you now need to ensure you have a GPU driver that supports the <em>VK_KHR_maintenance5</em> Vulkan extension, as it is now required. The DXVK developers having been relying on some guarantees from it since version 2.5 but now it's required to "remove some maintenance burden". For AMD and Intel they now recommend Mesa 25.1 and for NVIDIA 575.51.02.</p>
<p>The "Descriptor management" was "largely rewritten and modernized" to make use of the <em>VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer</em> Vulkan extension for newer AMD and NVIDIA cards. They said it "significantly reduces CPU overhead compared to the legacy binding model" and for CPU-bound games like these below it should improve performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy XIV.</li>
<li>God of War.</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio.</li>
<li>Watch Dogs 2.</li>
<li>And others.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's disabled on older GPUs due to performance issues. They're also "strongly" recommending enabling Resizable BAR now on supported systems.</p>
<p>For modern Battlemage and Lunar Lake Intel GPUs, "Memory defragmentation" is now enabled by default.</p>
<p>On discrete GPUs they're now enforcing driver-reported VRAM budget and will "dynamically evict unused resources to system memory when under memory pressure". The result should be improved performance for many Unity Engine games on VRAM-constrained systems, along with potentially allowing higher texture quality settings in some games. However, it doesn't currently work on AMD GPUs due to "kernel driver issues".</p>
<p>Some legacy features were removed in this release like the state cache to reduce maintenance burden. Plus these other bug fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for planar video output views. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4872" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4872</a>).<br/>
	This is required for video playback in <strong>JR EAST Train Simulator</strong>.</li>
<li>D3D11 shaders will now zero-initialize all variables and groupshared memory by default in order to work around game bugs resulting in undefined behaviour. The <code class="inline-code">d3d11.zeroWorkgroupMemory</code> option was removed accordingly.</li>
<li>Optimized D3D9 <code class="inline-code">StretchRect</code> in certain multisample resolve cases encountered in Source Engine. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5023</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an instance of invalid Vulkan usage in <strong>Modulus</strong>, and possibly other Unity Engine games that use the D3D11 video API.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the <code class="inline-code">ID3DDestructionNotifier</code> interface.</li>
<li>Vulkan devices that lack the required feature support to run DXVK will no longer be listed as DXGI / D3D9 adapters. This may fix crashes in case an outdated graphics driver or an unsupported integrated GPU are present on the system.</li>
<li>Trying to build DXVK in a MinGW environment with AVX enabled will now result in a compile-time error.<br/>
	We cannot support AVX builds due to toolchain issues, nor is it expected to be beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Astebreed</strong>: Fixed crash when changing graphics options. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5034" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5034</a>)</li>
<li><strong>GTR - FIA GT Racing Game</strong>: Worked around a game issue that would cause it to not start. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5072" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5072</a>)</li>
<li><strong>LEGO City Undercover</strong>: Worked around a game issue that would cause the intro video to be broken. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4997" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4997</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5000" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5000</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Star Trek: Starfleet Command III</strong>: Worked around resource leak in GOG build. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5056" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5056</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Test Drive Unlimited 2</strong>: Worked around alt-tab issue causing input loss. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5057" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5057</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Wargame: European Escalation</strong>: Worked around gamma issue when the game detects an Nvidia GPU. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/5055" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5055</a>)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Happy Birthday, GamingOnLinux - 16 years today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time really flies huh? GamingOnLinux has now been around officially for 16 years.</p>
<p>Over the last year or two we've seen a good few other sites shut down, some had big layoffs, others got sold and turned into gambling sites, and various got sold off to the owners of IGN but we're still here to keep reporting on everything related somehow to Linux and the wider gaming industry. A big thank you as always to everyone reading, commenting and sharing our articles. An extra big thank you to all our supporters for keeping us going!</p>
<p>Right now, things are pretty great. But, all that could change. With the continuing rise of AI being shoved into our eyeballs at every opportunity, the web is going to look quite <em>different</em> a year from now. With Google, Bing and others determined to get you to use AI that barely credits the writers that actually power all their responses (like me, hi).</p>
<p>What this does is remind everyone that the big search engines are <em>not</em> your friends. They want your data and for you to never click away from them. The longer they keep you, the more data they can grab and the more adverts they can show you.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, Microsoft also back in May decided to just remove us from Bing News and massively deranked us, following 1 single hour downtime due to a data centre problem and show no signs of putting us back in - which was a bit of a blow (so we barely appear in anything like DuckDuckGo now). I've tried explaining this to Microsoft, and they just don't care.</p>
<p>Following GamingOnLinux <em>directly</em> is now more <strong>important</strong> than it <em>ever</em> has been before. How you can help: be sure to share your favourite articles to social media, Reddit and wherever else.</p>
<p>It's not <em>all</em> doom and gloom though, fear not, GamingOnLinux has no plans to go anywhere. Web traffic is still currently somehow the <em>highest</em> it has <em>ever</em> been! And we have no plans to use any AI generation for anything. It's all hand-crafted spelling errors and terrible grammar here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our Steam Tracker page</a> also recently expanded to begin to include the top Linux distributions used on Steam over time. It's a manual process and will take a while to fill up, but I thought it would be interesting to see for the trends.</p>
<p><em>Oh, and for those who liked it, our PC Info system is coming back. Stay tuned, it needs some work though to modernise it and fix a lot of issues it had in the background.</em></p>

      <title>OpenMW 0.49 arrives to enhanced Morrowind and they&#39;re looking to support later Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whew, this one took a while. Around three years of development went into OpenMW 0.49.0 which is now available to play Morrowind with lots of enhancements.</p>
<p>An absolutely massive update for the open source game engine reimplementation, with so many things new it would be impossible to list them all here. Easily one of my absolute favourite projects because Morrowind is such a classic it deserves to be kept alive and well.</p>
<p>Should look better than ever too with many new graphical updates like water ripples, water transparency, specular lighting, improved post-processing and more. There's physics improvements, upgrades to the scripting system for modders, UI improvements, a faster launcher, translations support in the launcher, animation blending support, pathfinding improvements and it feels like the list goes on forever. The list of bug fixes is also rather long.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21034970371751624932gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>General gameplay was a focus for this release too, like getting melee combat to actually look and feel correct. As they said "Nobody knows how it works, and if you think you do, you don’t. Even if your name is Todd Howard. Nevertheless, trying to get it right was a focus for this release, and we replaced the physics-based hits of previous releases with Morrowind’s more simple scanning of the player’s surroundings based on a hit cone defined by the game settings". The result is that it should feel better and hitting flying enemies is now much easier. But it's also now easier for flying enemies to actually hit you too.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more exciting is that they've begun prototyping work to support Oblivion (2006), Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4. What they said about it: "You’ve read that right. Leveraging community research, we’ve begun prototyping support for Oblivion (2006), Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4, games based on later revisions of Bethesda’s open-world game engine. Their game files can be enabled as “mods” for Morrowind or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/example-suite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenMW Example Suite</a> in the launcher. The console can then be used to teleport to their locations. As we’re picking the low-hanging fruits, early support includes very basic “walking simulator” functionality".</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://openmw.org/2025/openmw-0-49-0-released/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their release announcement</a>. You need to own Morrowind to play it which you can grab on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_goty_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>There's no exact word on when Proton 10 will arrive officially and not classed as a Beta, Valve will set it live properly once they feel it's ready. Eventually, it will then replace Proton 9.0-4 as the main stable default version of Proton.</p>

      <title>Blue Archive from NEXON arrives on Steam and works on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blue Archive is an incredibly popular anime gacha RPG from NEXON that has made its way from mobile to Steam, and it works on Linux too.</p>
<p>Quite surprising, since it's another anti-cheat enabled game with Nexon Game Security, but it works completely out of the box with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. I went through the whole prologue and there wasn't an issue at all. To be sure I also went through the account linking process, which also worked fine.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> now has it listed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4661444721751619832gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Begin Your Story with the Girls of This Epic Anime Fantasy RPG Blue Archive's world immerses you in a detailed fantasy journey, following the stories of the girls in Kivotos. This title blends anime visuals, action, relationships, and RPG strategy. Embark on a journey filled with emotion, adventure, and unforgettable moments.</p>
<p>A Fantasy-Filled Anime RPG You’ll Never Forget!</p>
<p>Step into the role of a teacher in Kivotos, a fantasy city with magical schools and thrilling adventures. Guide students through school experiences and military operations. Each girl's story is part of the Kivotos adventure, creating a vibrant RPG world with heartwarming moments and unforgettable stories.</p>

<p>If you're curious why it has anti-cheat, that's pretty simple. It's a gacha game, one where you spend money to gamble on getting more content. Similar to loot boxes in the basic mechanics of it. The anti-cheat is to protect their revenue for that. These games have proven to be incredibly popular, so even if you're not the target audience — seeing it work out of the box on day 1 on Linux systems is really good to see.</p>
<p>Not just desktop Linux, but it also works just fine on Steam Deck too. There's no controller support, but thanks to Steam Input you can arrange the keybinds however you want and it still feels just fine since the controls are incredibly simple. You're mostly using mouse input and one button and that's it. So right thumbpad and the trigger is pretty much it, no issues.</p>

<p>For Steam Deck players, hopefully some audio troubles will be resolved with this update! There's also now AMD FSR 4 and other general improvements.</p>
<p>The full listed changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Various performance optimisations.</li>
<li>Various crash fixes and stability improvements.</li>

      <title>GeForce NOW on Steam Deck really can be a game-changer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that NVIDIA GeForce NOW actually has an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/geforce-now-app-for-steam-deck-has-arrived/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official dedicated app</a> for the Steam Deck, I've taken it for a spin and came away impressed. <em>Disclosure: NVIDIA gave me access to the Ultimate subscription.</em></p>
<p>It's no secret I'm a fan of Cloud Gaming, after covering plenty of Google Stadia (R.I.P) previously before Google shut it down. The tech was <em>great</em> and it worked well, but Google's business plan <em>sucked</em>. GeForce NOW on the other hand has the best of all worlds. You can play games on various devices, and those games are actually yours from various other stores. So if NVIDIA ever shut it, you haven't lost those games.</p>
<p>One of the major benefits of course is how you can run games that the Steam Deck struggles with. You'll get to see better visuals and better performance from pretty much anything that's available on GeForce NOW. That's just icing on the cake though, as GeForce NOW is a fantastic choice for games that have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat that blocks Linux platforms</a>, so it also opens up a whole lot of extra possibilities there too filling a nice gap. </p>
<p>Until this new dedicated app arrived, I had only really used GeForce NOW in passing. Whenever it was needed for work, like how in March 2022 I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/chrome-on-steam-deck-now-supports-the-deck-controller-with-geforce-now-working/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported on it being easier to get it running on Steam Deck</a> via the browser. And a bit of occasional gaming but not a regular amount as the experience just wasn't the best overall.</p>
<p>Now though? It's actually quite <em>amazing</em>. The app is so easy to use and setting it up is a total breeze (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here's a guide for it</a>). A friend wants me to jump into Fortnite? Yeah, okay — not a problem! I've been repeatedly shocked at just how good it feels overall, 99% of the time I truly cannot tell that the game is being beamed from somewhere far away through the internet. At times, it feels a bit like magic.</p>
<p>The battery life you get on the Steam Deck OLED with it is simply amazing. Over 7 hours playing Fortnite. I think that's enough in one sitting for anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14357184771751557027gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14357184771751557027gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7964518941751557028gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7964518941751557028gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And gosh, visually, it looks absolutely magnificent on the Steam Deck OLED screen.</p>
<p>What truly makes my mind get into a mess is just how the input is just so good. I cannot tell the difference between playing a local game and playing via GeForce NOW. This game is being beamed through various wires across vast distances, and yet — I can very rarely tell.</p>
<p>Pricing is perhaps is an issue though, but that very much depends on how you look at it. Free for one hour to test, £9.99 a month for the 1440p Performance sub and £19.99 a month for the Ultimate sub with 4K HDR and 240FPS. Both the subscriptions support RTX too. However, you can also buy a 6 month subscription at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>If we take the £9.99 monthly rate across let's say 3 years, that's about the price of a reasonable modern GPU. Not taking into account all the other components. So even thinking about it like that, the cost is actually pretty reasonable for what you get access to on lower-end cheaper devices.</p>
<p>One major issue I've come across is that the Steam integration is just at times — rubbish. It will get stuck on "Loading user data..." and nothing happens. This is not a Linux / Steam Deck issue, it's a clear problem with the service that has lots of reports from even a quick Google search. It seems to happen on specific games with no clear cause even on Windows. Sometimes games won't load either, jumping in again today before publishing, it took Dune: Awakening 4 attempts before it actually launched.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17893838301751558027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17893838301751558027gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's one element I really dislike about it though in terms of features, which is the 100 hour a month playtime limit. Even if you're paying for the highest tier, you get a static 100 hours per month (with a 15 hour rollover). Across 31 days that's less than 3 and a half hours a day. To some, it might still seem like a fair amount overall, but it could be pretty easy to go over it and have to pay more. I get why they added a limit (nothing is truly unlimited), but I still don't like it.</p>
<p>Another obvious downside to note is that developers need to actually opt into GeForce NOW and not every developer does, and even then it still needs NVIDIA to accept the game onto the service. The list of what you can play on it is quite long, but still has plenty of limits. Games also do get removed from it now and then when agreements expire.</p>
<p>It's not a one-size-fits-all solution for those reasons above, and add to that the issue of your internet service and your home networking. You need a reasonably good ISP to make the most of it in terms of speed and bandwidth, plus your home network has to have a strong signal. Small bumps in latency can be felt quite clearly at times in random visual quality drops and controls suddenly lagging. For me, that has been an extremely <em>rare</em> thing, only happening a couple of times in a lot of hours testing but it <em>does</em> happen.</p>
<p>We're coming to Summer now in the UK, and GeForce NOW has actually been a huge benefit for me here too. My office gets way too hot with my PC running, <em>unbearably</em> hot at times and being able to escape with the Steam Deck and play various games that I wouldn't be able to usually in a cooler environment (and with vastly better battery life) is such a nice double bonus.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be doing my duty at this point if I didn't <em>moan</em> about something though. NVIDIA now support the Steam Deck which is great, but what about other Linux distributions? SteamOS as a whole? Traditional desktop Linux?</p>
<p>They've shown very <em>clearly</em> they can make it work to the point that it feels fantastic. It's currently limited to 1080p in the browser on Linux, so either removing that restriction, or opening up the Steam Deck app properly to desktop Linux would be the next step. I'll be bugging them about this regularly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7487550691751554756gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7487550691751554756gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - GeForce NOW Fortnite, Desktop Linux</em></p>
<p>Overall, when it actually works properly, GeForce NOW is truly <strong>awesome</strong> on Steam Deck. But there's still quite a number of annoying issues with all their integrations at times.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS to get new kernel-based anti-cheat, devs say it will still work on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 03/07/25 13:58 UTC</strong> - According to their community manager they will still maintain Linux platform support. As they said in their Discord server:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Hey guys! There are no plans to drop support for SteamOS/Proton/Wine and/or SteamDeck, despite us not officially supporting the platform, we will do our upmost best to maintain your ability to play!" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1131419261751551200gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Even better, a developer of Embark followed up to note:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Just to add to what Dusty just said, we're working pretty closely with CodeWeavers to QA every release we put out there since about Season 5, and I don't see a reason to stop that. It's not exactly a collaboration, but we do catch issues with SteamDeck early because at the very least they do a pass on the game before we release a patch. Do we miss some things once in a while, absolutely. It's not our primary platform after all, but we understand there is a pretty passionate and growing playerbase on SteamDeck.  Please keep reporting issues here, to our support, or report them to the Proton devs directly, and we will investigate what we can do to fix things..." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18455982851751551345gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That's really nice to see, and far more than a lot of developers do. So we can expect to see THE FINALS continue working on Linux with Proton.</p>
<p><em>The article title was updated to reflect the updates.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Embark Studios announced they're working on a new anti-cheat system for THE FINALS, which sounds like bad news for players across Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here we go again huh? We've had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends blocked</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online blocked</a>, all modern EA online games blocked, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox blocked</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/crsed-cuisine-royale-devs-confirm-end-of-linux-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CRSED: Cuisine Royale blocked</a> and various others. This is why we have a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> so you can see at a glance what will work.</p>
<p>Buried at the bottom of the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2073850/announcements/detail/541109583272218051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update notes</a> posted today, the developer said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><strong>Security</strong><br/>
With every big update comes a renewed commitment from our Anti-Cheat team:</h5>
<p>Cheat makers operate in a low-risk, high-reward world. They profit by selling cheats, oftentimes packing them with malware that harms their own customers, and they face very little consequences for their actions. Meanwhile, players who use their cheats risk losing everything: their accounts, their money, their time, and their chance to participate in events and competitions.</p>
<p>Our strategy for combating this is simple: raise the cost, difficulty, and time required to develop and distribute cheats.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the 7.0 patch notes, a lot of cheats these days use a kernel-driver to read and write memory to gain an unfair advantage. This means that they run in a privileged mode in the Windows operating system, making it unlikely and in some cases impossible to detect via Anti-Cheat in the game client. The technical solution to combat this is kernel-driver Anti-Cheat. We believe that this is, and will be, a requirement for every competitive multiplayer game for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>We’re also using machine learning to analyze player behavior, and we have been doing so since the launch of THE FINALS. Machine learning provides valuable insights, especially when detecting cheats such as aimbot usage.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will also begin an incremental rollout of a new kernel-based anti-cheat solution, intended to significantly raise the bar for cheat makers.</p>
<p>Cheat makers exploit everyone: players, developers, and the community itself. We’re committed to protecting fair play and adapting to new threats.</p>
<p>Despite claims from cheat developers that they’re “undetectable,” every cheat leaves breadcrumbs and we’ve been following them. Closely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7815545061751546680gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Currently, the game uses Easy Anti-Cheat which is already Kernel Level on Windows, but user-space is enabled on Linux platforms so it does currently work. Once they force this new Kernel Level anti-cheat they're working on, that's likely to change and cause the game to be unplayable on Linux.</p>

      <title>POSTAL 2 Redux gets a Steam page</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/postal-2-redux-announced-a-full-remake-of-the-unhinged-classic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">POSTAL 2 Redux was announced recently</a> and now it has a Steam page ready for you to follow along for this upcoming Linux game. I've never really gotten far into the original so I'm looking forward to getting into a modern version of it.</p>
<p>As a reminder it's dropping Unreal Engine and going with Unity, with plans for Native Linux support too. Bringing with it the ultimate chaotic sandbox with enhanced visuals and physics, new weapons and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12518195881751545418gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>High-res Textures &amp; Dynamic Lighting: Paradise’s warped billboards and puddles of questionable fluid finally get the razor‑sharp grime they deserve.</li>
<li>No-load Streaming World: Sprint from one end of town to the other without a single elevator, door pause, or immersion‑breaker.</li>
<li>Smarter Crowds and NPCs: Civilians still snitch, cops still overreact, but improved path‑finding means riots spark faster and messier than ever.</li>
<li>Updated Arsenal: Weighty ballistics, rag‑doll dismemberment, and rounds that punch clean through unlucky bystanders.</li>
<li>Fully Propped and Destructible Environments: Stores, arcades, and alleyways are stuffed with physics‑enabled junk begging to be destroyed.</li>
<li>Champ 2.0: Pet him, sic him, or let him photobomb your next headshot; Paradise’s goodest boy finally earns his kibble. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“POSTAL 2 Redux is equal parts love letter and update to a certified gaming classic,” said Eric Masher, COO, Impact Inked. “We’re thrilled to play a part in bringing such an iconic and infamous game to modern audiences!”</p>

      <title>CarX Street developers are optimising for Steam Deck and &#39;adapting the game for Linux&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently CarX Street added in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/carx-street-added-easy-anti-cheat-and-fixed-it-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat which has been causing issues</a>, but they're working on improving it for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1114150/announcements/detail/511836185696404797" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, they made it clear that EAC is here to stay but there's some good news for Linux players. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why were there issues with Linux and Steam Deck?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<p>Initially, CarX Street was not positioned as a game with Linux or third-party emulator support. However, given your interest, we have already started adapting the game for Linux systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Partial Deck support, which existed before version 1.7.0, was restored in patch 1.7.1. We are aware of complaints about unstable performance and are actively working on optimizing the game for Steam Deck. Note that full official Deck support was never previously announced, but we are striving to achieve it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they've added in Easy Anti-Cheat, the player count has actually more than doubled. But we're talking only a 24 hour peak of 1,657 players. Nice to see another developer actually think about improving their Linux support though, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat being a real problem</a> for Linux platforms.</p>

      <title>Stop Killing Games consumer movement hits some major milestones</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> has seen a massive surge recently and it has hit some vital milestones.</p>
<p>What is it? A consumer movement, pushed initially by YouTuber Accursed Farms, that aims to stop game developers and publishers just removing video games they've sold. A big part of it comes from what Ubisoft did with The Crew, shutting it down completely so no one could access it, even if you had only purchased it a few months prior.</p>
<p>It has a noble cause but has struggled a bit until very recently, where the campaign has just absolutely exploded.</p>
<p>In the UK, the <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">newer petition</a> has flown past the 100K signatures (126,066 at time of writing) needed for it to be considered for a debate in Parliament. That doesn't mean it will happen, just that it now needs to be considered by the UK government to potentially have it mentioned. A good step though, with signatures still flowing in until July 14th, showing there's demand for change.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EU side</a>, things are also going well there now too. Against the needed 1 million signatures, it's now hit 977,864 (at time of writing). According to the official Accursed Farms X account, they've had <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940499343137706437" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> of "non-citizens spoofing signatures on the EU initiative" so it may be a little inflated.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I do miss the days where you could easily host an online game with developers just providing server builds. We do still have a fair amount of games that do that, but along with the rise of micro-transactions, some bigger publishers really want that complete control over it. Still, for a game that's no longer being sold, it would make sense then to release it.</p>
<p>Even better - open source. Yeah, I had to get that in here. More developers and publishers just should open source their much older games to let them live on. It's such a waste of all the time and effort put into it and such a loss for gaming history each time these games just vanish because a publisher moves onto something else.</p>

      <title>Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for June 2025 is out - here&#39;s the latest for Linux and SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the data for the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for June 2025, here's the usual GamingOnLinux run over it - with a little extra.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The operating system stats for June were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.67% +0.22%</li>
<li>Linux 2.57% -0.12%</li>
<li>macOS 1.76% -0.09%</li>
</ul>
<p>The drop for Linux can generally be associated with the increase in Simplified Chinese as a language option on Steam. Pretty much every time it increases, Linux overall drops. Same again here English dropped to 36.31% (-1.93%) and Simplified Chinese rose to 26.73% (+2.61%).</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a> here's the current course for Linux on Steam:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194101631751532568gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Those with an eagle eye (or who bother to look) at our Steam Tracker page might notice something entirely new. We're now tracking the Linux distro share on Steam over time here at GamingOnLinux too! I thought it might be interesting to see for trends for certain distributions. It's a manual process and will take time to backfill, but it's already proving to be quite interesting.</p>
<p>It looks a bit like this below, but far <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more interesting to look at properly</a> as our charts are interactive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15841549101751533448gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Overall Linux distro share for June 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 31.04% +0.09%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.49% +0.40%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.90% +0.14%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.62% -0.80%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.40% -0.23%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.21% -0.09%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 3.18% +0.64%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.46% +0.03%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.40% -0.04%</li>
<li>Bazzite 42 (FROM Fedora Kinoite) 64 bit 2.37% +2.37%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.06% -0.11%</li>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) 64 bit 1.98% -0.01%</li>
<li>Other 20.87% -2.40%</li>

      <title>ProtonPlus makes managing Proton versions on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck simple</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonPlus is a useful tool for managing compatibility layers like Valve's Proton, GE-Proton and more on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While many will likely know of the popular ProtonUp-Qt app <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ProtonUp-Qt&amp;title_only=on&amp;type=anything" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that I've covered here a lot</a> on GamingOnLinux, ProtonPlus has been steadily building up a real nice list of features and it might even be time to switch over. In fact, I actually vastly prefer the UI design in ProtonPlus - it's a lot cleaner and super simple to use it. Not that ProtonUp-Qt was hard, but options are great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/153900131751474906gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/153900131751474906gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The app supports managing Proton for Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher and Bottles. With support for various different community versions of Proton along with other tools like Luxtorpeda, Boxtron and Steam Tinker Launch.</p>
<p>With a recent update to the app in June, it now has a page where you can view all your Steam games and individually change the Proton version used for them.</p>
<p>On this page there's various sorting options, you can also adjust launch options, and there's a button to go right to ProtonDB too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12822492701751474907gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12822492701751474907gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/Vysp3r/ProtonPlus" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>Confused on all the different versions of Proton? We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a guide here on GamingOnLinux to help clear that up</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods to get Age Verification in UK / EU for adult content, plus a new cross-platform app upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/nexus-mods-is-under-new-ownership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus Mods recently changed ownership</a>, and some major changes have been announced in regards to some of the naughtier mods.</p>
<p>In an official news post from July 1st, the Nexus Mods team noted they have to comply with the UK government’s new Online Safety Act and the EU’s Digital Services Act. As part of that, they're going to be introducing age verification for people in the UK / EU "for the majority of adult content hosted on the site" but they're not going into the specifics of what just yet. This does not affect people outside the UK / EU — yet.</p>
<p>Additionally they're tightening the rules on "illegal content" along with introducing an "automated detection for Child Sexual Abuse Material".</p>
<p>This is something they absolutely <em>have</em> to do, or end up potentially facing huge fines.</p>
<p>On top of that there's new community controls like a new "Ignore" feature hiding content from people you don't like, they're also adding a way for mod author to block specific users too.</p>
<p>Read more in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the news post</a>.</p>
<p>Jumping into the discussion, the previous owner of Nexus Mods commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the people who think this is the fault of the new owners of Nexus Mods, please either read the news post above properly or read up on the laws around child safety online that are coming to every major western country either this month, or in the coming year (including most states in the US).<br/>
<br/>
We did not write these laws, we have no control over these laws. Nexus Mods is not an underground website operating on the dark web - it's a legitimate business that has to follow the laws of the countries it operates in. If we don't follow these new laws then we will get fined out of existence (the fine in the UK alone is 10% of worldwide revenue or £18 million ($25 million USD) - whichever is higher).<br/>
<br/>
Whoever owned Nexus Mods, whether it was still me or the new ownership, would have had to have dealt with it this year no matter what. Frankly, I'm relieved that it is not me who has to deal with this or be responsible for the content on the site directly because I have some big misgivings about how it is being enforced. However, if it was me, I would still have followed the letter of the law, and I'd have been doing what is written above. Because I'd have to.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, you can be worried or angry with the direction the internet is taking and the amount of control governments are enforcing on it around the world, but the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's something even GamingOnLinux has to be aware of, and we had to make various changes to ensure we comply with laws like the UK's Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>On top of the above news, they also recently released version <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.13.4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">0.13.4</a> of their in-development open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app. It includes the ability to now easily set a location where mods are installed, there's some new artwork and various bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8387887311751462949gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Their team mentioned in a app <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15313" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> that they're currently working on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Further progress on collection creation and curation.</li>
<li>Continued improvements to mod updates.</li>
<li>Ongoing support for Baldur’s Gate 3.</li>
<li>Epic Games Store support.</li>
<li>Custom mod storage locations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mecha BREAK is out now on Steam - works on Steam Deck but blocks Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pretty much as expected, Mecha BREAK is out now and it's Steam Deck Verified but the anti-cheat is a real nuisance.</p>
<p>I reported here on GamingOnLinux recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/mecha-break-now-steam-deck-verified-and-steamos-compatible-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">about it becoming Steam Deck Verified</a>, and also back in February about how it's using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which blocks Desktop Linux</a>. The situation is unfortunately exactly the same now it has released. If you're on a traditional Linux desktop like Ubuntu or Fedora, the game simply won't progress past the launcher. You can hit Play and then it will wait a moment and do nothing. It's noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our curated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Kz2e0AOXxsA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc0be94e7e878fc696d93828f4094433.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Kz2e0AOXxsA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it being Steam Deck Verified, I decided to take it for a spin just to see if it deserved the rating. The testing was done on my Steam Deck LCD with the default <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> that it was verified with. Testing the online mode it all worked out of the box, including bringing up the on-screen keyboard automatically for entering in my nickname.</p>
<p>Mecha BREAK mainly focuses on online play with team battles in 3v3 or 6v6, and there's also a PvPvE Extraction mode.</p>
<p>As for performance, sticking with the defaults since Valve's rating of Steam Deck Verified notes the default graphics "performs well on Steam Deck" and it does appear to run reasonably well. Performance is usually around 30-40FPS even during intense action. It looks pretty <em>rough</em> due to the scaling on it but that's the price you pay to have a playable modern bigger game on Steam Deck a lot of the time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20210353881751450294gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20210353881751450294gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11071874421751450292gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11071874421751450292gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It appears to actually deserve the Steam Deck Verified rating, if you can handle the rather blocky visuals.</p>
<p>I did have the game crash and quit to the launcher once during my testing, which might not be a Proton problem. It's a brand new game, it's expected to have a few issues here and there.As expected with a free game, it's proving to be quite popular with a 24 hour peak player count of 97,006. It has a Mixed user rating on Steam with players noting the monetisation is pretty expensive, customization has been reduced, technical issues and more problems.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-8 brings fixes for DOOM Eternal, Wuthering Waves and Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another smaller update to the GE-Proton compatibility layer for running more Windows games on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck. We only just had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/ge-proton-10-7-out-now-with-fixes-for-wuthering-waves-anno-1800-wine-wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-7 / GE-Proton 10-6 with a bunch of fixes</a>, and now we get second helping. </p>
<p>Here's all that's <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton10-8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix DOOM Eternal black screen regression when using wine-wayland</li>
<li>Disable steam input and xalia in wine-wayland (they dont work with it) and enable sdl instead</li>
<li>Add protonfixes for Blade &amp; Soul NEO -- game is now playable but there is a known crash in-game when you open the settings. Opening the settings at character select works fine</li>
<li>Add protonfix to set SteamOS=1 for Wuthering Waves --game is now playable</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<em>Pictured - Wuthering Waves</em></p>
<p>Confused on all the Proton versions? Be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide</a>. Also see my guide on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to install GE-Proton</a>. My usual advice is to stick with Valve's official Proton, unless there's something specific you need in GE-Proton as there's less support and testing with it.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 575.64.03 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA are really doing the meme of incredibly helpful mobile app store changelogs with this one.</p>
<p>On July 1st, NVIDIA put out the 575.64.03 stable driver for Linux and their incredibly descriptive and useful changelog told us all this was new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep — that's the entire <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/249055/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>However, looking a bit further, the supported products tab has changed to now include the recently announced GeForce RTX 5050 for desktops and laptops. A little odd they didn't bother to actually note the newly supported GPUs in the changelog directly.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, NVIDIA also recently announced the upcoming 580 series <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-confirm-upcoming-driver-will-be-the-last-for-maxwell-pascal-and-volta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">will be the last for Maxwell, Pascal and Volta</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source PS2 emulator PCSX2 v2.4 brings SDL 3, Wayland support, lots of compatibility fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2 v2.4 has been released, bringing with it many enhancements to game support and improved Linux support too.</p>
<p>Their new blog post also goes over the updates in the previous version 2.2 from October last year, as it turns out they never properly put up a blog on what was new with it. Projects like this are simply awesome. Emulation is key to keeping the history of gaming alive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14592648961751382013gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Hitman: Contracts on PCSX2</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's new? A lot! But in short to save you a bit of time here's some cherry-picks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huge fixes to a wide variety of games. Some had black screens or incorrect rendering that have been solved.</li>
<li>Custom real-time clock settings available per-game.</li>
<li>HDR texture optimization resulting in some big performance improvements.</li>
<li>A new automatic fix applied to ~100 games for some upscaling issues.</li>
<li>Wayland by Default on Linux.</li>
<li>SDL 3.</li>
<li>Various other small optimizations and improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all for June's top 50!</p>
<p>What have you been playing recently? I'm still completely hooked on REMATCH, I really do love it and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/rematch-is-the-perfect-competitive-game-for-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's perfect for the Steam Deck</a> so I was surprised to see it all the way down at #64 for June. But I've also finally picked up It Takes Two, playing it with my partner with the Steam Deck docked to my main TV and so far it's been great fun.</p>

      <title>Sunshine game stream host for Moonlight gets security fixes, Linux improvements and more features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LizardByte released the latest major update to Sunshine, the game streaming host platform for Moonlight to stream games from one system to another. It's a popular solution, and often works far better than Steam's own Remote Play, and supports various devices.</p>
<p>More about it: "Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Offering low latency, cloud gaming server capabilities with support for AMD, Intel, and Nvidia GPUs for hardware encoding. Software encoding is also available. You can connect to Sunshine from any Moonlight client on a variety of devices. A web UI is provided to allow configuration, and client pairing, from your favorite web browser. Pair from the local server or any mobile device."</p>
<p>Sunshine v2025.628.4510 is the first bigger release for a while, an <em>essential</em> one to upgrade too since it includes fixes for two major security issues to do with the web UI not being secure enough.</p>
<p>Main changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release contains critical security updates. For more information see the following:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Please update as soon as possible!</p>
<p>This release also contains many new features and bug fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encoder probing fixes.</li>
<li>Display automation is now disabled by default, you can re-enable it in the Sunshing config UI.</li>
<li>RestAPI improvements.</li>
<li>Async encode added for NVENC.</li>
<li>Native DualSense support on Linux.</li>
<li>Headless monitor support on Wayland Linux.</li>
<li>Minimum FPS is now be based on client framerate.</li>
<li>New languages and updated translations.</li>
<li>Many behind the scene updates to the build, ci, and dependencies.</li>
</ul>
