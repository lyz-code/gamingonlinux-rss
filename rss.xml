      <title>System76 launch multiple new powerful Linux laptops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not one, not two but three product announcements from System76 today as they're launching a range of new Linux powered laptops. First is the Serval WS that will be getting a refresh but they're also bringing back the Adder WS and the Bonobo WS.</p>
<p>System76 said all of them can be configured with up to 64GB RAM, have at least a 144Hz display and up to 8TB of storage. In the case of the Serval WS it has a 165Hz screen, and the Bonobo WS can have up to 12TB of storage. So there's something that will hopefully fit every need.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8088464511682014864gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adder WS — Starting at $1599!</strong>
<ul>
<li>For the first time, System76 offers a laptop with NVIDIA 40 Series graphics — up to the GeForce RTX 4070. The new Adder WS is also equipped with an i9 13900HX CPU (24 cores, 32 threads) and DDR5 RAM. The NVIDIA RTX 4070 has more VRAM and a 54% higher clock speed than the previous generation. With its formidable speed, the Adder WS is perfect for budding professionals setting out on the next phase of their career.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serval WS — Starting at $1799, shipping mid-May</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to an i9 13900HX CPU, DDR5, and NVIDIA 40 Series graphics, the 17” Serval WS brings a 4K display option back to the System76 line. A 15” option is also available with a 1080p matte display at 165 Hz. Serval WS provides high-speeds ports like USB 3.2 gen 2, Thunderbolt 4, and 2.5GbE ethernet, and can power up to 5 displays (4 external). If you’re going to be downloading and uploading lots of data, this laptop is for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coming Soon: Bonobo WS — Starting at $3299!</strong>
<ul>
<li>With an i9 13900HX CPU, DDR5, and up to an NVIDIA RTX 4090, the Bonobo WS once again returns as System76’s most powerful laptop. Amazingly, it’s also one pound lighter and 43% thinner than the previous Bonobo WS. Like the 17” Serval WS, the Bonobo WS features a 17” 4K display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they have a few laptop models back now, they've also launched a <a href="https://system76.com/laptops-powerful" target="_blank">comparison page</a> (which actually died as soon as it went live due to the demand). Clearly System76 are doing well, and they recently teased work on their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/system76-ceo-teases-in-house-linux-laptop-code-named-virgo/" target="_blank">upcoming custom laptop</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 23.04 is out now with GNOME 44 and a stable Steam Snap </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has today released Ubuntu 23.04, their latest short-term new-feature release (it's not an LTS) that will be supported until January 2024.</p>
<p>One of the big user-facing additions is the new installer that they say offers a "streamlined and more intuitive user experience". While it offers up a refreshed look the code behind the scenes is the biggest change - since it now shares the code-base with Ubuntu Server so they can give a more consistent experience.</p>
<p>This release also has GNOME 44, so you get all the latest enhancements there but Canonical also updated Ubuntu font, and they mentioned some big Snap update behaviour changes too. Instead of notifying you an update for a Snap was available and then making you go somewhere to update it, you will now get a background download and then it will be applied when the app is closed. You can also now pause Snap updates for as long as you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17882932881682006886gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17882932881682006886gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's plenty more like their Snap of Steam being promoted to stable. Canonical said over 150,000 people downloaded the preview version, so there was plenty of interest in it. This Snap bundles a bunch of dependencies needed allowing you to run new and old titles without messing with PPAs.</p>
<p>On top of that Ubuntu Cinnamon and a resurrected Edubuntu join as official flavours.</p>
<p>Canonical also did a video about their new installer:</p>

      <title>Stellaris 3.8 will add two co-op modes now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can safely say co-op is not something I ever expected for a strategy game like Stellaris but it's coming. You can even test it now. Version 3.8 is now in Open Beta on Steam, you just opt into the 3.8 version in the Properties -&gt; Beta window.</p>
<p>The two modes it will add in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative PvE can be initiated from the main menu - all players that hotjoin the hosted game will join the primary player’s empire. This mode is primarily intended for teaching new players or for lower intensity cooperative gameplay.</li>
<li>Cooperative PvP can be allowed by the host of a standard multiplayer game. When enabled, empires can open themselves up to allow other players to help control their empire. We expect this game mode to be useful for competitive team play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These actually sound really great. I can think of numerous games I've had where a helping hand would have made things a lot easier, especially in the late game where you're controlling so much and there's constantly things happening. Great stuff from Paradox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79WxfMJSzWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c77d58a750d4d5793abd5bb8745a68ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79WxfMJSzWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the other improvements coming in Stellaris 3.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added unique textures for Mercury, Venus, Neptune and Uranus for the Sol system.</li>
<li>Added unique textures for Earth and Mars when terraformed based off of available heightmap data.</li>
<li>Added new anomaly The Orb</li>
<li>Added a special solar system protected by the Lone Defender.</li>
<li>Added a decision to clear the wreckage on a Broken Shackles starting planet in the event that they are conquered before they enact the Memorial to the Unshackled decision.</li>
<li>Improved accuracy of tooltips on the galaxy setting screen and implemented experimental nested tooltip functionality.</li>
<li>The mind-wiped species from On the Shoulders of Giants will now have the Forcefully Devolved trait.</li>
<li>The Observation Insight Situation now remembers what approach you had when it last finished.</li>
<li>There is now a 1% chance that a pre-ftl civilization will spawn with the Forcefully Devolved trait.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus all the usual bug and balance fixes that Stellaris updates bring.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Minecraft Legends working on Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Legends just recently released on Steam and sadly at release it just wouldn't run, a quick bug report later and Valve has already <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1648890302621683712" target="_blank">solved</a> it with Proton Hotfix.</p>
<p>Initially trying through any Proton version tested it just wouldn't load, and it was the exact same problem on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop. It would just bring you right back to your Steam Library. I opened a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6696" target="_blank">bug report</a> and now thankfully it's solved. So now as long as it's set to Proton Hotfix, you're good to go. Valve have set Proton Hotfix on it, so as long as you're not forcing a different version, it will pick it up automatically.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S58JyK-lXck"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3169862688b668401478236e3bcd429b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S58JyK-lXck" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once again, Valve and their developers working on Proton have reacted very quickly to a brand new release, which is really good to see. I have found that sometimes it will just randomly crash though. Not overly often but it does happen.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, you'll want to drop it from High to Medium in the graphics settings, which seems to give overall a rather stable 60FPS and it's very smooth apart from minor loading hiccups. On High settings on Steam Deck, it will dip down to 40FPS and sometimes below, so still doable but honestly it's perfectly fine on Medium and looks great.</p>
<p>Another issue I noted, specifically on desktop Linux with the Stable Steam Client, is that the Microsoft Account login was just a blank window in the Steam browser that pops up. However, if you simply resize the window, it then renders correctly. There's an existing <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9014" target="_blank">bug report</a> for this for the main client. The login there worked fine.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, the login may seemingly not work getting stuck after entering a password, but reloading the game showed me logged in just fine. You can also try the login on Desktop Mode on Steam Deck but for me in Gaming Mode simply restarting after waiting a minute after entering password worked.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10023681001681994731gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10023681001681994731gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ultra settings on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>So a few quirks but overall once you in, it performs great and looks great with Proton Hotfix.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928870/Minecraft_Legends/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>If You Like… Slay the Spire</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When Slay the Spire launched, back in January 2019, it represented the pinnacle in what became a well recognised genre - Deck Builders. Let’s delve into that genre and see lies beneath the surface.</p>
<p><em>IYL (If You Like) will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>Note: I did a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/deck-builders-round-up/" target="_blank"><u>very similar article last year</u></a>, so there will be serious overlap! Future IYL articles will of course cover different genres!</p>
<p>Before we start, let me be clear that while Megacrits’ game “represented the pinnacle” on its launch, it didn’t define the genre exactly. There were many predecessors that led to its creation and it would do several fine games a disservice to suggest that StS was first.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/208485801681923722gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/208485801681923722gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you fancy a dip into what must surely be the inspiration for StS, you could look at Deep Sky Derelicts, The Guild of Dungeoneering, Ironclad Tactics or even the excellent Hand of Fate games. But it was Megacrits’ game that rolled all the elements into a compelling package. It sold 1.5M copies at a recent count, half a million in early access alone.</p>
<p>I’m not going to pick bones about “Deck Builders” vs “Engine Builders” vs “Card Battlers” here. Let’s just dive in.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>A direct clone - Neoverse [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/994220/NEOVERSE/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h4>
<p>What happens when you take Slay the Spire’s three wonderfully constructed character choices and replace them with scantily clad female alternatives? Well, if the developer is Tinogames, you get an original take on StS with well thought out unique decks and mechanics, but with gorgeous, fully animated graphics thrown in. Playing Neoverse is very similar to playing StS, but sometimes feels more like a Final Fantasy game due to the gorgeous wind-ups and cinematic take downs.</p>
<p>Whether you play as Naya with her radioactivity, Clare with her shield and blocks, or Helena with her summons, each fight feels fair and crucially, just like StS, some enemies are easy as one character, but brutally difficult as another.</p>
<p>It might be unfair to call this a StS clone, since Neoverse launched only around three months later, so presumably started development pretty much alongside its famous rival, but I can’t find any developer retros and later is later, so here we are.</p>
<p>Should you buy it? Mostly yes - it has a lot of nuance that grows on you over time, like the parry, combo and precision systems that reward careful gameplay. Just be aware that it’ll look like you’re playing a dodgy porn game while you’re taking down those demons.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Games that do it better - Roguebook (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076200/Roguebook/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/roguebook" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>) and Breach Wanderers (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1394130/Breach_Wanderers/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Oh boy, this’ll get me into trouble, I’m sure. But what it boils down to, for me, is that I’d rather play either of these games, than even one more run of StS.</p>
<p>Roguebook is set in the world of Faeria (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397060/Faeria/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general_archive/faeria_an_amazing_strategy_trading_card_game_scg" target="_blank"><u>GOG</u></a>), by Abrakam Entertainment, a game I couldn’t get into. But other than tapping into the Faeria lore, the two games are very different. Roguebook takes the StS formula, then gives you two characters to play with. Block is shared, only the first character takes damage (usually), and cards have a simple mechanic to swap your characters around - if you block, or play a <em>charge</em> card, you go to the front. And it works amazingly well, opening up a huge series of tactics around positioning, blocking and healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4846536321681925186gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4846536321681925186gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15536601561681925188gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15536601561681925188gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17879619341681925189gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17879619341681925189gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But that’s not all - each of the four characters have their own decks and own unique capability which means that the synergies between these decks can be amongst the most game-breakingly satisfying that I’ve ever come across. Like in StS when you get your Ironclad to 999 block and draw a <em>Body Slam</em>. Seriously. Endorphin city.</p>
<p>The overworld map is beautiful, the sound design is endearing, enemies are diverse and (for the most part) fun to battle, and the attention to detail is just wonderful. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>As for Breach Wanderers, the recommendation is just as heartfelt, but… murkier. Launching at Steam Next Fest back in Q3 2020, and still in Early Access today, the developers are two friends in Montreal with a vision. That vision is that their unique take on the Deck Builder puts the emphasis on the building. In Breach Wanderers, you can choose (with a few well considered restrictions) what your opening deck will consist of AND what will be in the pool of available cards throughout your run.</p>
<p>Having grown up on first edition Magic the Gathering, the ability to customise your opening deck is simply wonderful. After 110 hours of Slay the Spire’s opening four or five fights being absolutely identical in nearly every way, here was a game that gave me a choice of four opening fights with a custom deck tailored to <em>exactly</em> how I wanted to play the game. Throw in around 8 characters, interesting new game mechanics and a very grindy (in a good way) meta game and it’s plain that this one has some serious longevity beyond simply throwing Ascensions at you until you fall over.</p>
<p>It’s early days for me with the game, but so far the combination of the familiarity of StS, but with the freshness of actual deck building is an absolute winner. Highly recommended.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Something a little different: Hadean Tactics (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260590/Hadean_Tactics/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>) or Monster Train (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/monster_train" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Remember Dota Underlords (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046930/Dota_Underlords/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a>)? God I loved that game. Until I didn’t anymore, but that was after 150 hours, so not bad for a freebie! Anyway, so did the developers of Hadean Tactics, a husband and wife team from Brazil. So much so, that the base game involves choosing your core hero, recruiting two to four followers, then throwing them into a grid-based auto-battler which could be easily mistaken for Valve’s PvP timesink.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155545701681929992gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3155545701681929992gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2738531461681929991gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2738531461681929991gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>The differences wrack up pretty quickly though. To start with, this is PvE. Also, every 7 seconds, the game pauses and you have the familiar three mana to spend playing a choice of five cards. These can be straight up damage dealers, but the most interesting cards reposition the board, or can buff or debuff a few seconds of the fight. There’s a StS-style progress map, and of course, relics and upgrades for each of your units along the way.</p>
<p>It’s slick, it’s different and it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Next up, Monster Train - often cited as one of the best deck builders out there, I was excited to finally give it a try a few months ago. And yep, it’s excellent. The basic format is almost like a tower defence, as enemies enter your four-level train at the bottom and work their way upwards toward the train’s core on the top level. That gives you three levels to place your “heroes” and buff them with your deck options.</p>
<p>The graphics are absolutely stunning, the overworld map is simple but fun and the fights are usually very fair. Variety is bolstered by having around 5 or 6 factions that you can play, each with their own deck, and each run is a combination of two of these factions to further mix up possible synergies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19748689721681932986gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19748689721681932986gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/757381731681932984gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/757381731681932984gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But while it is a truly excellent game, I have a similar problem with Monster Train as I do with Slay the Spire - after a certain point, the only replayability is in Ascensions, which simply rank up, introducing harder bosses and more punishing runs. That’s fine to a point, but it feels a little bit lazy, especially compared to Roguebook’s excellent mix-and-match challenge system which affects not just difficulty, but even how the core game is played.</p>
<p>I have no regrets though, as my nearly 60 hours in the game will attest.</p>
<h4><strong>And the rest</strong></h4>
<p>And wow, this is a big list. I’m too lazy to link all of these to their various stores, but if you’re serious about your deck builders, you don’t want to miss out on…</p>
<p><strong>Griftlands</strong> - two decks, one for fighting, one for diplomacy, all wrapped up in a story-driven series of missions. It’s out of Early Access now, and highly rated on Steam, but something didn’t quite click for me on this, particularly odd since it’s made by the awesome Klei team.</p>
<p><strong>Nowhere Prophet</strong> - guide your fledging army across the wasteland to find them a new home. Hints of base building in this one, with a Darkest Dungeon vibe at times.</p>
<p><strong>Across the Obelisk</strong> - Four heroes, four times the fun, with a story-driven overworld map. Some complicated mechanics on show here, but it’s highly-rated on Steam. I only played a handful of hours during Early Access and it’s one I’ll be going back to, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Trials of Fire</strong> - One of my favourites due to the lovely table-top feel the fights have. A really interesting open-world over-world map and a loose set of mission objectives to drive you forward. More tactical than the others, since the fights factor in position, range and line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Sky Derelicts</strong> - one the daddies I mentioned earlier, this is a sloooow starter, but worth sticking with as you build your team to take on the sci-fi themed enemies. Your deck is defined by a combination of your equipment and your character, giving some nice customisation.</p>
<p><strong>Card Hunter</strong> - a freebie, and like Trials of Fire, this introduces tactical positioning and elements like area of effect. Gets a bit naggy about buying a subscription eventually, but there’s tens of hours of enjoyment to be had first and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons vibe is hard to resist.</p>
<p><strong>Inscryption</strong> - part deck builder, part escape room, this dark, creepy adventure will keep you guessing throughout its three story-driven acts. I can genuinely say that it’s the first game in which pulling out your own tooth with a pair of pliers is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Tainted Grail</strong> - some unique takes on familiar mechanics and a 3D third-person overworld based around the idea of a torch slowly burning down gives this one great tension. I need to play more, as there are heaps of characters to unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Hellcard</strong> - only a couple of months old this one, but already showing promise as you put three adventures up against the army of darkness. It’s co-operative, apparently, but I don’t know how effectively that works. In single player, each character takes a slice of “pie” on the battlefield as the enemies surge towards you, each character playing their own decks, with their own special capability. One to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Room for one more? Check out Liam's recent article on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/takara-cards-is-a-unique-space-sci-fi-deckbuilding-tactical-strategy-game/" target="_blank">Takara Cards</a>, a new Early Access, space-themed deck builder.</p>
<p>And that’s it for deck builders. Did I miss any? Is Slay the Spire still the king for you? I haven’t mentioned its various excellent mods, such as Downfall, so perhaps you’re all still enjoying the champion of deck builders through its total conversions, or fan-made characters &amp; decks! Let me know in the comments!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>POSTAL 2 from Running With Scissors just had a big upgrade for the 20th anniversary and there's lots of improvements to this classic violent first-person adventure.</p>
<p>Quite possibly one of the most ridiculous games ever made, there's so many terrible things you can do in it which is great if you love a bit of dark humour. Not me of course, you would never find me laughing at the ability to give yourself the middle finger in a mirror.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17069294231681918390gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17069294231681918390gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Takara Cards is a unique space sci-fi deckbuilding tactical strategy game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fusing together the best elements of deckbuilders and tactical turn-based battles, Takara Cards is a little unusual to get into but full of charm to keep you wanting more. It feels like an evolved idea from their previous game, NEXT JUMP: Shmup Tactics, which was also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It's showing a huge amount of promise for the rather quirky story to it, one that sees you chasing Dragons through space as you build up your deck of abilities, progress through various turn-based battles and encounter various strange events. The combat is certainly interesting, with your deck being both your pilot and your ship and the battles are you travelling through space with your aim to destroy as much as possible and survive to continue on.</p>

<p>Currently in Early Access and available now on Steam, it comes with full Native Linux support and the developer mentioned they're ensuring it works nicely on Steam Deck as well. It's made with Godot Engine and other open source tooling as well.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play cards in a <strong>DEEP tactical turn-based Combat.</strong></li>
<li>Over <strong>70 cards</strong> and 34 unique units (so far).</li>
<li><strong>Create your character</strong> by choosing Cards and Reputation, among other things!</li>
<li>Your Deck is your Pilot and your Ship: <strong>Build it by venturing </strong>through the Cosmos and Events.</li>
<li><strong>Exoteric Karma System</strong> that influences your Character and Ship.</li>
<li><strong>Synergize between</strong> dozens of UNIQUE cards to <em>clear</em> the board of enemies <strong>in one Turn.</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.1 to get FSR 2.2, better 3D support for OpenGL, shader improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like the next update for Godot Engine is going to be a nice one for game developers, with multiple graphics enhancements on the way. Detailed in a new <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/rendering-priorities-4-1/" target="_blank">blog post</a> they revealed some of the focus for Godot 4.1, now that the dust has began to settle on the huge Godot 4.0 release that provided Vulkan support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1266249911681911728gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1266249911681911728gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Godot 4 with the <a href="https://github.com/perfoon/Abandoned-Spaceship-Godot-Demo" target="_blank">Abandoned Spaceship demo</a>.</em></p>
<p>With the 4.1 release planned for this year, now they're moving to more regular releases, some of what they have planned to add includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify bottlenecks in 3D rendering to improve performance.</li>
<li>Time slicing DirectionalLight3D shadows to reduce GPU pressure for shadows.</li>
<li>Background pipeline compilation to improve shader loading times.</li>
<li>Finishing the 3D renderer for their OpenGL compatibility that targets lower-end and mobile devices.</li>
<li>FSR 2.2 for their Temporal AntiAliasing solution, along with integrating a bunch of effects with it like SSAO, SSR, shadows and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Godot Engine is a free and open source game engine for developers, you can see more on the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed added a slick story campaign</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed is a shooter all about toys, a bit like the classic movie Small Soldiers and back in late March, it had a huge free upgrade. Honestly, this would have been my dream game to play through growing up. With movies like Small Soldiers and Toy Story, I probably would have had a tiny heart attack of excitement seeing this.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support, it's Steam Deck Verified and I checked it out a bit today in the new mode with all the improvements and it feels great! Looks fantastic too, they really have the toy style down nicely. With the new update that landed on March 27th, they really put the work in on this one with it filled full of cartoon-strip 90s inspired cutscenes, lots of voice over and overhauls to multiple parts of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7720567981681909910gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7720567981681909910gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All the major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the new Story mode to the base game. Cinematics and missions!</li>
<li>Added Primary and Optional missions to all levels. Some missions are completable in Free Roam for extra time.</li>
<li>Added new Boss enemy. The big man himself: Major Evil.</li>
<li>Added new Max Damage and Major Evil unlockable characters with multiple skins for characters and weapons!</li>
<li>Added new level (Rental Lair), the final stand against major evil in this upscale fancy apartment.</li>
<li>Added Story Cinematics menu to Extras so you can rewatch the cutscenes.</li>
<li>Added Max Ammo minigame playable Arcade Machine to the new Apartment map.</li>
<li>Added Max Ammo minigame button to the Extras after completing all objectives on the new map.</li>
<li>Added new Map selection and Campaign lobby for offline Singleplayer/Splitscreen to a better view of enemies and objectives.</li>
<li>Added Objectives list to the ingame Pause menu so you can more easily check your objective progress.</li>
<li>Added new random poses to characters in the Lobby menus.</li>
<li>Added new music tracks. Some music in earlier levels has been moved around for a more fitting gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Added level specific Bots that match the cutscene characters!</li>
<li>Added Options &gt; Controler slider for adjusting the Aim Damping effect.</li>
<li>Added a system to detect a corrupt save file and to restore a valid one from a backup.</li>
<li>Added objectives to end of round screen.</li>
<li>Added spectator-death mode to track enemy that killed you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A shooter that blends in tower defence, with you facing off against many different types of enemy toys, what's not to love about it? You can play it solo or in co-op with up to 4 people with local and online multiplayer supported.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hypercharge-unboxed?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Domination is the latest expansion for the popular strategy game from Paradox Interactive and there's also a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"Centered on the most popular and powerful nations in Europa Universalis IV, Domination revisits and revises once familiar pathways while adding more historical context and challenges to great nations like China, England, France and more. In some cases, branching missions will force you to make a choice that will irrevocably change the course of your nation, focusing your priorities in a particular direction."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x9tkAlvUXQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d28c136338e57dfba4b82bd2f739b2f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x9tkAlvUXQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Domination includes new national mission trees and features for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Ottoman Empire: A revised conquest tree with new rewards for pushing Ottoman dominance, including expansion through the new Eyalet system, and new internal changes, such as the new Janissary estate, the new Ottoman Decadence mechanic, and the ‘Ottoman Power Struggle’ disaster.</li>
<li>China: Different mission trees for the Han Ming and invader empires like the Qing. Choose between expansion and Inward Perfection, and counter the power of the Eunuchs to build a more stable empire.</li>
<li>Japan: Unite Japan as you deal with the power of the Shogun and the independent Daimyos. Choose to open the country to foreign influence or keep it isolated, while deciding upon different paths of expansion and reform.</li>
<li>Russia: Free your country of the Tatar yoke, and transform it into a Great Empire. Choose the path of Peter’s reforms to modernize the state, so your mission tree as well as your mechanics will change and evolve as the game progresses. Use the power of Cossacks and Streltsy to expand your Empire to East and West.</li>
<li>Spain: Expanded mission trees for Castile and Aragon, with different paths to form Spain, a new mechanic available for the new ‘System of Councils’ government, and decisions about the Army and Navy to get the mighty Tercios and Spanish Armada.</li>
<li>France: Fight the end of the Hundred Years War, centralize France into an absolute monarchy while dealing with the Wars of Religion, expand into Italy and the Holy Roman Empire, and lead the Revolution through an expanded mission tree.</li>
<li>Great Britain: Separate paths for either a British Empire or an Angevin Britain, as well as a deeper internal gameplay, with unique features for the English Parliament and changes to the English Civil War disaster.</li>
<li>Minor nations: Mission changes, new government mechanics and expanded flavor for Prussia, Portugal and Korea.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's also the v1.35 "Ottomans" update, which along with a ton of fixes it brings in these extras:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 3 new sets of Ideas (Infrastructure, Court, and Mercenary), and further rebalanced all the Idea Groups.</li>
<li>Added 27 new events related to the new idea groups.</li>
<li>Added a new Tier of Government Reforms, Related to Military Doctrines, with 7 reforms.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Estate Privileges, to estates that did not have a privilege that exempts them from seizing land.</li>
<li>Added more Ruler, General and Admiral personalities.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Parliament bribes and National Bribes, which are more expensive versions of bribes, but cover multiple parliament seats at a time, to Common Sense DLC.</li>
<li>Added 21 new Imperial Reforms, 21 new Decrees, and reworked special Age Abilities for Mandate of Heaven DLC.</li>
<li>Added 11 new Naval Doctrines to Rule Britannia DLC.</li>
<li>Added 11 New Iberian Holy Orders to Golden Century DLC.</li>
<li>Added the Latin Empire as a tag which can be formed through the Crusader mission tree to Emperor DLC.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Great Projects to Leviathan DLC.</li>
<li>Added 9 new Achievements.</li>
<li>Re-Added the Trade Protectorate subject type, available for countries that confirmed Thalassocracy.</li>

      <title>Fedora 38 is out now with GNOME 44, official Budgie desktop spin and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora has a big new release available in version 38 which came a bit early. As usual lots of new features and fixes, plus a fancy new Budgie desktop spin.</p>
<p>You can grab it as the main Fedora Workstation which includes an upgrade to GNOME 44 that's filled full of new features like the thumbnail view in the file picker, a new lock screen, enhanced quick settings with a "background apps" section, improvements to accessibility settings, better Flatpak support along with the new unfiltered view of applications on Flathub and so on. The Fedora team also made an adjustment to make shut downs faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14124217601681837433gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14124217601681837433gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Fedora Workstation 38</em></p>
<p>This release also brings with it new official spins (alternative desktop environments) like the Budgie Desktop, "Sericea" that comes with the Sway window manager in an rpm-ostree version and a Phosh image for mobile devices. This is in addition to the existing spins with KDE, Xfce and more.</p>

<p>Various other upgrades like the inclusion of the updated dnf5 package manager for testing that has performance improvements, a smaller memory footprint, and a new daemon that can provide an alternative to PackageKit.</p>

      <title>Survival game Vintage Story set for a huge update with a big story event</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a survival game that I simply love to watch and casually dive into now and then, and it's probably one of the most impressive indie open-world survival games around, if you like things hardcore.</p>
<p>Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's often thoroughly uncompromising and it has a ridiculous amount of depth in some areas. The soon to release v1.18 update is going through the last release candidates right now and there's absolutely loads new including the first major story event, where you discover and go through a vast underground structure.</p>
<p>Another major change is the upgraded world generation with various new land forms, a geologic activity system, large scale mountain regions and more additions to world gen. Loads more added including a butterfly net and 160+ new types to collect, a glider to flow down from high altitudes, rafts, treasure maps, a writing system and bookshelves, an overhaul to doors, angled beams for construction, an improved tutorial system, ruined weapons, improved chiseling (one of my favourite features to craft!) and the list goes on and on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zD_Ui1dq-FU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4a01f40891a38f9afc4de47d3e03cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zD_Ui1dq-FU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seriously impressive stuff from a tiny team, especially for a game not sold on Steam. All the changelog details can be seen in their <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/" target="_blank">News forum</a> for 1.18.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, they're also working to update from .NET Framework 4.6 to .NET7 concurrently, which will be in a future release. They're hoping to see "smoother performance, some future-proofing, and potentially broader stability on Linux and MacOS".</p>

      <title>Zoria: Age of Shattering now skipping Early Access to release in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of the upcoming squad-based tactical RPG Zoria: Age of Shattering have changed their release plans, and they're now going to skip Early Access entirely with a small release day.</p>
<p>Originally they planned to release into EA in April, but now they're instead doing a full release on September 19th. Why? They said "We evaluated our latest milestone and realized that Zoria is so close to being completed that putting it on Early Access would only water down our progress. Launching Zoria in EA would mean launching an incomplete game for a few months when in reality, we only need a few months to finish the game.".</p>
<p>You can check out the previous trailer (now with the wrong date) if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xiaxUtG0KbI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3daae76b1a7a3e7969dbaa07abdebba8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xiaxUtG0KbI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Zoria is a squad-based tactical RPG with fluid turn-based combat, outpost, and follower management, set in an expansive fantasy world. In the game, you will lead a team of four heroes at a time with their unique skills and perks. Every team member will contribute to the battles you will undertake.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are the Commander </strong>- Lead your diverse team through the fantasy lands of a Uram continent and challenge countless groups of monsters and bosses.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the world of Zoria</strong> - Zoria has now fallen prey to the sheer brutality of the hellspawn that roams its land. Its lush forests, mysterious caves, and majestic buildings have transformed into haunting locations. Explore these mysterious lands to uncover the mysteries within.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Turn Based combat </strong>- Use the unique skills of all of your party members to fight your way through the land. Attack from close range or distance with different attack patterns and directions; heal or shield allies with various spells and commands and use your surroundings to your advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Craft, rest and survive</strong> - Keep a keen eye on your equipment and vitality as they both deteriorate over time. A bonfire in Zoria's provides a safe spot to restock your resources and prepare for the next battle.</li>
<li><strong>Class based accessibility </strong>- Take care of each of your warriors' skill development, and it will repay you on the battlefield. Having an individual with the right skills can get you into previously inaccessible places and quests. Specific characters interacting with various objects in the world of Zoria may lead you to discover hidden treasures or make your travel easier, so explore all the options!</li>
<li><strong>Base management </strong>- You have to be wise in and out of the battle. Players can regularly update the base by unlocking new wings to the buildings, which will reward you with resources, quests, or items.</li>
<li><strong>Follow missions</strong> - In your outpost, you can plan and assign tasks to your companions. Send selected party members on an autonomic mission, in which you won't participate but will receive what they find along the way. Never forget that their lives are in your hands!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available with Native Linux support on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/zoria_age_of_shattering?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1159090/Zoria_Age_of_Shattering/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Valheim is getting extensive difficulty options including a creative mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim continues to be one of the most popular survival games on Steam, and it seems in an upcoming update there's going to be much more extensive customization of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Teased in <a href="https://twitter.com/jsmars/status/1647968860711145481" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post by developer Jonathan Smårs, there's a quick video and a follow-up gif to show off some of the new options coming. After watching the quick video here's a breakdown of the modes shown off (all subject to change of course):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy</strong>: Combat is easier and there are less raids on your base.</li>
<li><strong>Hard</strong>: Combat is harder and monsters will raid your base more often.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore</strong>: Combat is a lot harder and monsters will raid your base more often. When you die all items you are carrying and skills are lost forever. You have no map and you may not use portals.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive</strong>: In immersive you have no map and you may not use portals so you will need to use your wits to keep track of where you are in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Hammer Mode</strong>: In Hammer mode you can build all buildings for free. There are no raids on your base, and monsters will not attack you until you provoke them. Other difficulty settings are normal.</li>
<li><strong>Casual</strong>: In casual mode monsters will not attack you until provoked, there are no raids on your base, resources are plentiful, you will not drop equipped items or lose skills on death and combat is a lot easier and events are based on your individual progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just the <em>preset</em> levels though as there's sliders and tickboxes for various things underneath you can change like: the combat difficulty, death penalty, resources, raid rate, portal items, no build cost, player based events, no map, no portals and passive enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7656789351681820678gol1.jpg"/>Source - Jonathan Smårs on Twitter.</em></p>
<p>In replies Smårs clarified you will be able to change them whenever you want, and it will be set per-world for all players and can be changed on current worlds.</p>
<p>When to expect it? Smårs said it is planned to come with the "Hildirs Quest update coming soon".</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Picma - Picture Enigmas gets a free Steam release, lots of Picross styled puzzles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your Picross? Check out Picma - Picture Enigmas, a new Steam release with Native Linux support and it has a lot of content. It's also free to play, to a point. </p>
<p>I'm sure most of you know what Picross and related games are? You match up tiles in a board, based on the numbers at the sides and it eventually reveals a picture. They can be a great way to unwind and test your brain at the same time. </p>
<p>"Uncover hidden pictures using your logic skills. With a library of over 100,000 community-created puzzles, distributed across multiple puzzle types, you are unlikely to run out of challenges. So, have a seat at the Moonberry Café, let Charlotte bring you a cup of your favorite drink, and relax as you sip and solve through Picma - Picture Enigmas." — Moonberry Arcade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-LdJx_2fLrc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fff4475df8331b269d12d81213f88d51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-LdJx_2fLrc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Much more than Nonograms</strong> - Find your favorite picture logic game from our selection of three puzzle types (more coming soon).</li>
<li><strong>Quality despite quantity</strong> - Our user content is curated by the community and only a fraction of the submitted images become puzzles.</li>
<li><strong>True logic puzzles</strong> - All of our puzzles are machine-verified to have a single logical solution.</li>
<li><strong>Massive puzzles</strong> - Our puzzles range from the tiny 5x5 all the way to the gigantic 50x50.</li>
<li><strong>True multi-color puzzles</strong> - What you solve is what you get, with up to 8 colors per puzzle.</li>
<li><strong>Play for free daily</strong> - Create and rate images to earn Coins and play at no cost.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The monetization might put some people off though. It does come with ~72 free puzzles split across three different modes, so there is quite a decent share of free content but the rest you need to pay for in some way. You can either buy coins, or buy a ticket for a length of time to access everything (like $5 for a full month), you can create puzzles to earn coins, or vote on other's designs to also earn coins. So there's multiple ways. </p>
<p>An interesting way to do monetization on a free game, although I can't see that being overly popular. I went to earn some free coins by rating what people had made, and it just instantly said there weren't any left. Still, the free stuff that's there was all pretty good. <u><strong>Update</strong></u>: the developer messaged to mention you still get a coin reward for going to rate images if there's none left (and they're right, I missed the coins it sent). They said they're going to make that clearer.</p>

      <title>MangoHud performance overlay gets a few needed fixes in v0.6.9-1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the previous release of v0.6.9, <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> has another nice update out that fixes up a few lingering problems for the Linux performance hud that's also used on Steam Deck for the built-in performance info.</p>
<p>Here's the changes in v0.6.9-1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that applied picmip without option being set.</li>
<li>Reverted x11 poller that was causing segfaults <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/06edee407159f9c52cc060fa5ba135539d4c909a" target="_blank"><tt>06edee4</tt></a>.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with horizontal and legacy_layout.</li>
<li>Fixed amdgpu APU power and temperature reading.</li>
<li>Fixed certain hud elements displaying incorrectly in horizontal.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing segfault when using <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_CONFIG</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue with some elements not being in the right place with the horizontal layout was a little annoying, which I reported, so I'm really glad to see such a quick fix there so we can cram in more details. Here's a fresh example on the latest version on Fedora KDE with Everspace 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7407494031681817597gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7407494031681817597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you're interested in this layout you can use this below, place it into your MangoHud configuration file. The main one can be found in: <code class="inline-code">~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf</code></p>

      <title>Iris and Sodium for Minecraft move to Modrinth away from CurseForge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you use the popular <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/iris" target="_blank">Iris</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium" target="_blank">Sodium</a> mods for Minecraft? Well there's been a bit of an issue lately, so the developers have dropped support for CurseForge and fully moved over to Modrinth.</p>
<p>What are the mods? Sodium is a free and open-source rendering optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves frame rates and stuttering while fixing many graphical issues. While Iris is an open source shaders mod. Both rather well-known for Minecraft fans.</p>
<p>What's going on? Well, according to the official <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisShaders/status/1647359296584417280" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account for Iris, they explained they were having technical issues with CurseForge along with difficulty in actually uploading anything. Apparently the newer CurseForge is quite broken and according to the Iris team CurseForge are "prioritizing modpacks that rip off out mod's branding in search results" and their revenue from CurseForge has been declining "despite the fact that the number of downloads has been increasing month-over-month". In a later Twitter post, the Iris team <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisShaders/status/1647702711771725824" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that "Effective immediately, Iris and Sodium have been pulled by Overwolf for encouraging users to download from Modrinth and archiving files. Modpacks will be broken.".</p>
<p>So now they're recommending all users move over to <a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a>, an open source mod hosting platform, that works directly with many popular Minecraft launchers like <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism</a> that work great. Here's a shot I took with Iris, Sodium and Complementary Shaders v4:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4455812901681749976gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4455812901681749976gol1.jpg"/></a>OOOoo pretty!</em></p>
<p>Seems like a messy situation, hopefully the move to Modrinth will go well. Modrinth overall seems like a good platform for Minecraft modding, putting the power more in the hands of everyone.</p>

      <title>Publisher of King under the Mountain backs out so it&#39;s re-releasing as Mountaincore</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>King under the Mountain was a pretty nice colony-building game from Rocket Jump Technology, and it was going through a huge upgrade. Sadly, their publisher cancelled on them so they're having to re-release as Mountaincore.</p>
<p>It's a bit of an odd one this. The developer went from working on it solo, to having a publisher come along to help fund further development allowing them to build a small team. The plan was to continue working solidly on it for 9 months, then do a brand new release under the publisher. Just as work was coming to an end the publisher backed away.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they've been allowed to just carry on, including with all the work funded by the publisher (who they won't name). So it's getting re-released anyway now independently as Mountaincore and all original owners will get the newer game too, so no one needs to re-buy anything. Sounds like a win-win for all involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9XP3rGsGBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20264c023daebedd90b4a257920d1d53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9XP3rGsGBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Originally inspired clearly by Dwarf Fortress, it also mixes in elements from other games like The Settlers, Prison Architect and Dungeon Keeper with an aim to be more approachable. Some of the new features due to arrive in the updated and renamed release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely redesigned UI - no more placeholder UI.</li>
<li>Skill levels so your settlers can develop over time.</li>
<li>Weapons, military management and a detailed combat system.</li>
<li>Monsters to deal with in the caverns of the mountains.</li>
<li>Invasions by hostile Orcs (other races to come soon).</li>
<li>Trading with merchants to plug the gaps in your industry.</li>
<li>Animations and general graphical improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370310/Mountaincore/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It's due to release into Early Access on May 18th.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley set for another update in v1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular games on Steam (and one of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/heres-the-top-steam-deck-games-for-march-2023/" target="_blank">most played Steam Deck games</a> too), Stardew Valley is coming back for another update in version 1.6.</p>
<p>The developer, Eric Barone who goes by Concerned Ape, mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1647638975568568320?cxt=HHwWgIDTjea6y90tAAAA" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "There is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier &amp; more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HC".</p>
<p>Looking back on it, this was actually already announced back in February where it was mentioned at the bottom of the 7 year anniversary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/3644012366894749557" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam. Seems the scope has expanded a bit though to include new content, as only modding changes were mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5244091971681740201gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5244091971681740201gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The modding scene around Stardew Valley remains as popular as ever, with all kinds of mods big and small like the extensive <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753?tab=description" target="_blank">Stardew Valley Expanded</a>. Plenty of the modding scene is thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI" target="_blank">SMAPI</a>, an open source modding API for Stardew Valley.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stardew_valley?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stardew-valley?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><em>Great to see it being supported for so long.</em></p>

      <title>MineClone2 v0.83 out now, the sandbox game for Minetest inspired by Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired might be pushing it a bit eh? MineClone2 as the name suggests really is a clone of early Minecraft, although this is free and open source powered by the Minetest game engine. A big new release is <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=423766#p423766" target="_blank">out now</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/minetest-570-out-now-with-graphics-improvements-performance-upgrades/" target="_blank">recent Minetest upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>MineClone2 v0.83 "Safe and Sound" is full of new features and honestly it sounds really great. You will find new and updated music, new sound effects, biome coloured foliage and water, mobs can ride minecarts, hoppers can put items in minecarts, new and improved /clearmobs commands, Iron Golems now protect themselves and villagers, various performance improvements, improved translations, lots of bug fixes and the list goes on.</p>
<p>You can see their latest release video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="F-Lai53_Ry4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f05edd2f7dd886b2a4b06a112619509a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/F-Lai53_Ry4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see this great free and open source Minecraft alternative coming along so nicely.</p>
<p>You need <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a> to play it, and then you can download it via the in-game content downloader.</p>

      <title>Lueur blends city-building with survival from a former Ubisoft developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Darenn Keller previously worked on the likes of Assassin's Creed and Ghost Recon, but now they're going indie with their city-building survival game Lueur.</p>
<p>Inspired by their love of 4x and city builders, but specifically a free little game called <a href="https://poppants.itch.io/lost-settlers" target="_blank">Lost Settlers</a>. Lueur is a minimalist tile-based city-builder, where you discover more as you explore and go through it. Developed to be cozy while building, but just a little challenging with the survival aspects of it — all with really simple controls. A key point here is the length, most games will only be around 40 minutes or so. You also build across various different levels, each with their own story and challenges to overcome.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19918943791681728711gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19918943791681728711gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tiles have little mini-games inside them too, so you'll play a tiny arcade game to do various things. It sounds so thoroughly unique I feel like I have to play it. A fun fact for you here: not only will it support Linux, the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/DarennKeller/status/1644344494194675713" target="_blank">told me</a> they're creating it on Manjaro too and they're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>There's also different modes available depending on your preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settlers: A cozy and relaxing experience. You are not completely safe, but you'll have time to experiment, learn and build your beautiful city. </li>
<li>Survivors: It's gonna be a real challenge to survive. Your choices matters and time is of the essence. </li>
<li>Deity: A fast-paced unforgiving experience very close to an RTS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer gives a fun overview of what to expect below and it seems full of surprises:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xCB-JrcixkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d3d44738be07ae9ffa7ffc1239181d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xCB-JrcixkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm very keen to give this a go, it looks great!</p>
<p>You can wishlist / follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Lueur/" target="_blank">directly on Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One I missed recently that you should check out: Black Reliquary is a free total conversion mod for the original Darkest Dungeon, and it's available now with a whole lot of content to play through. While it's completely free, it will need you to own the full game of course but it also needs the The Shieldbreaker DLC, and the Crimson Court DLC since it pulls features from them.</p>
<p>More about it: "Black Reliquary is a complete overhaul mod for Darkest Dungeon that harnesses the original systems whilst building upon, refining, or transforming nearly every single aspect of them. This mod features an entire new story and campaign in an exotic new desert locale, with fully voiced narration and an original soundtrack. Venture into The Valley, reach the Black Reliquary, and reveal its ancient secrets."</p>

      <title>Try out a free prologue of Shogun Showdown right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shogun Showdown: Prologue is a demo of the upcoming turn-based combat game with rogue-like and deck-building elements. It will have full Native Linux support at release, with a version available in the Prologue now too. From Goblinz Publishing, Gamera Games and Roboatino, the Prologue has so far been gathering some rather positive user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>For those of you who like repeatable games, it looks like a fun concept where positioning really counts during combat and you'll unlock plenty more as you go through it. Another game where you get that tasty "just one more run" feeling, before you realise it's 1AM and you really should be going to sleep.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rZHtTQP5FR8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5347de93467a071193999afa94067311.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rZHtTQP5FR8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available in the Prologue:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play The Wanderer: a lone warrior haunted by her past who travels the land seeking redemption through battle.</li>
<li>3 combat locations: The Bamboo Grove, The Waterfall Caves and The Port City.</li>
<li>14 attack tiles.</li>
<li>8 quests and 2 challenges.</li>
<li>10+ skills.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2316330/Shogun_Showdown_Prologue/" target="_blank">Steam right now</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/shogun_showdown_prologue" target="_blank">GOG too</a> if that's what you prefer. The full game is due out later this year.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us has more Steam Deck improvements and lots of other fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fires continue to be put out by Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy as they fix up The Last of Us, with a new patch landing with lots of fixes.</p>
<p>Available in v1.0.3 are these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/3730711090586078092" target="_blank">changes</a> just for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the native UI overlapped the ‘Look’ prompt.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the DualSense™ motion sensor function may not register the player shaking the camera to fix the flashlight when prompted.</li>
<li>[Left Behind] Increased the size of the Arcade’s mini-game button user interface.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance hasn't really been fixed up yet for Steam Deck, with it still pretty messy in lots of places and it's currently rated as Unsupported by Valve through Deck Verified. As Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1643305179901739008" target="_blank">previously</a> "Getting VERIFIED isn’t a priority. Optimization &amp; stability (on the Steam Deck &amp; other pc platforms) is!".</p>
<p>So eventually, once it's had more optimizations and fixes across the whole game, it might eventually be a reasonable experience on Steam Deck. At least on desktop Linux last I checked it worked reasonably well and this patch does include numerous crash bug fixes, texture problems and lots of other fixes.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>MangoHud performance overlay version v0.6.9 is out now as a nice update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a while since the last release but a nice update to the performance hud and benchmarking tool MangoHud is out now. This is the tool used for the performance stats on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Something I'm a big fan of, because I use it plenty on desktop Linux too, it's one of the most useful open source projects for gaming. An example of a pretty basic layout for performance:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14976972521681555066gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Version 0.6.9 brings these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for it8603 sensor</li>
<li>Conform to <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html" target="_blank">VUID-VkDeviceCreateInfo-pNext-00373</a></li>
<li>Add GalaxyClient, RedLauncher, Amazon Games and gamescope to blacklist</li>
<li>Add Artix and Nobara to build.sh</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using zink, and certain games using DXVK e.g. FarCry 3/4</li>
<li>Fixed reporting amdgpu clock speed</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with <code class="inline-code">exec</code> causing certain games to crash</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect metrics for ryzen 7000 series iGPUs</li>
<li>Fixed discovery of wine binary when using wine64 build</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also the addition of additional options to further tweak the experience how you want it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">exec_name</code> - Display current exec name.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">hud_compact</code> - Display compact version of MangoHud.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">hud_no_margin</code> - Remove margins around MangoHud.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">horizontal</code> - Display Mangohud in a horizontal position.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">toggle_hud_position</code> Toggle MangoHud postion. Default is R_Shift + F11</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_limit_method</code> If FPS limiter should wait before or after presenting a frame. Choose <code class="inline-code">late</code> (default) for the lowest latency or <code class="inline-code">early</code> for the smoothest frametimes.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">picmip</code> Mip-map LoD bias. Negative values will increase texture sharpness (and aliasing). Positive values will increase texture blurriness (-16 to 16)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">af</code> Anisotropic filtering level. Improves sharpness of textures viewed at an angle (0 to 16)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">bicubic</code> Force bicubic filtering</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">trilinear</code> Force trilinear filtering</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">retro</code> Disables linear texture filtering. Makes textures look blocky</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">position</code> new option: <code class="inline-code">bottom_center</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of a nice clean horizontal layout I tested today with Everspace 2:</p>

      <title>Ubisoft hiring Linux developer talent for XDefiant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XDefiant is an upcoming free-to-play, first-person arena shooter from Ubisoft and it seems they need a bit more Linux talent. In an advert on their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/743999879479053-linux-systems-engineer-xdefiant" target="_blank">careers website</a> there's one noted for "Linux Systems Engineer - XDefiant", with the option to work remotely too.</p>
<p>The placement reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a highly talented, motivated, and experienced person to work with us on XDefiant, a new multiplatform online multiplayer action game based in our San Francisco studio. XDefiant is a free-to-play, fast-paced arena shooter that combines intense gunplay with personalized loadouts and specialized factions, as teams of gunfighters battle for domination.</p>
<p>You’ll be working to extend and improve our game’s services running on Linux. You’ll be adding functionality and features, improving performance, and improving the Snowdrop engine’s support for Linux. As we all know, Linux is an extremely stable and performance-oriented OS, and you’ll be able to make XDefiant really shine there. You will work on a small, collaboration-oriented team where you will have the opportunity to contribute in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>You’ll also be part of the diverse Ubisoft San Francisco team. We embrace a variety of work situations based on what is best for the team, and we welcome people working in our SF office, <strong>remotely within the continental US</strong>, or some combination of the two. We put a priority on supporting our team members and what makes them happiest and most productive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you'll be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand and improve the Snowdrop engine’s presence on Linux.</li>
<li>Optimize engine and game code.</li>
<li>Debug and refactor systems as needed to take the best advantage of Linux.</li>
<li>Work with the rest of the engineering staff to help them expand their cross-platform mindset.</li>
<li>Coordinate with other developers to ensure smooth roll out of new features.</li>
<li>Create and maintain technical design documents and best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Could be a good one to try for some of our more experienced readers perhaps. Who knows, maybe it will even result in getting it working on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</em></p>

      <title>Landnama gives a non-violent exploration city-builder roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending features from city builders and dungeon crawling roguelikes, Landnama sounds pretty unusual, especially with the non-violent theme too.</p>
<p>You control a band of Vikings, as they set out to settle Iceland. There's no combat here though, as the game focuses on the farmers, explorers and builders. So the challenge here is the exploration, and the count-down to Winter and with a single resource of Heart you'll need to weigh up every possible decision.</p>
<p>So far they've only released a very brief teaser along with info about what it is, plus a bunch of screenshots:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bEAtDYrGoRI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dce3cdadd317ae33f49d8d4610cb6492.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bEAtDYrGoRI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly has me curious to try it.</p>
<p>Developed by indie team Sonderland, three dads and close friends from Germany, France and Canada with different backgrounds and perspectives on gaming, united by the desire to make beautiful, minimalist games they love to play. It will have Native Linux support at release. Their plan is to release it sometime this year, and there's a Playtest on Steam you can request access to try it.</p>

      <title>The latest Steam Survey had a huge surge of Simplified Chinese</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After waiting a while to see if Valve issued any corrections, it seems that the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for March 2023 is staying as it is, with a huge surge of Simplified Chinese. The last time we saw such a thing, it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-steam-hardware-survey-had-some-flaw-causing-cyber-cafes-to-be-over-counting-users.11711/" target="_blank">was an error</a> in the Steam Survey, as it was over-counting cyber cafe customers. This time, maybe not then.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">latest details</a> it shows users with Simplified Chinese as their language now at 51.63% (+25.35%), knocking down English to 22.83%. That's the kind of increase that certainly raises a few eyebrows. </p>
<p>Due to the influx, it also caused the Linux user share to go from 1.27% in February to 0.84% in March. Quite a stark drop, since Linux isn't particularly popular in Asia and again, we've seen that happen before a few times when Simplified Chinese as a language choice on Steam goes up, the Linux share goes down with it.</p>
<p>The biggest winner on the survey is Windows 10 64 bit, which went up to 73.95% (+11.62%). Filtering it over to just the Linux details, these are the most popular distributions for March 2023:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 21.20% + 0.15%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.36% + 0.19%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 9.61% + 9.61%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.10% - 0.17%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.95% + 0.45%</li>
<li>Other 44.79% + 8.33%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is of course: what's going on? What do you think has happened? </p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-55 released with an essential fix for Easy Anti-Cheat issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-55" target="_blank">version 7-55</a> was released a few days ago, and it's an essential update for those of you preferring it to the official Valve Proton on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>It appears that when releasing version 7-53 a few weeks ago, which included a fix for Star Citizen, it ended up causing problems for other games using Easy Anti-Cheat. Here's what's changed in GE-Proton 7-55:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a hotfix for EAC. In 7-53 the star citizen hotfix broke EAC compatibility for other games, this has been fixed now.</p>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to git.</li>
<li>nvapi enabled for final fantasy stranger of paradise.</li>
<li>legacy xactengine winetricks protonfix removed as it's finally no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>LIVE A LIVE from Square Enix is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LIVE A LIVE originally released in the 90s for the Super Famicom, and now it's being revived with the same style as OCTOPATH TRAVELER and it's already Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It doesn't actually release on Steam until April 27th, so it's another nice example of Valve getting some early pre-release testing of a bigger upcoming game. Hopefully we'll be seeing more of this to come, as the popularity of the Steam Deck continues to rise, it would be good to have more developers work with Valve before release to ensure their games are in a good state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LIVE A LIVE, originally only released for the Super Famicom in Japan, is being revived on Steam! Experience this legendary RPG, brought to life in the same HD-2D visual style as OCTOPATH TRAVELER.<br/>
<br/>
Meet seven heroes, each with their own unique abilities and lives to live across different time periods. Experience their stories in any order you choose, uncovering shocking developments along the way:<br/>
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Prehistory: A tribesman comes of age in a world without words.</li>

<li>Present Day: A martial artist strives to become the strongest there ever was.</li>

      <title>Microsoft experiments with a handheld Windows 11 mode for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 13/04/23, 17:11 UTC</strong>: the developer involved is playing it down noting it didn't go anywhere and it's not a recent thing, mentioning in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12kjgkh/comment/jg3lsvm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post ("this article" is referencing The Verge):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started this hackathon project and it didn’t go much of anywhere, but this article uses wording to make it seem like it’s something under development. Problem is - We just didn’t have the right engineers to do a lot of what we wanted to do in the short hackathon project timeframe. Maybe this odd article can help me pitch this to Microsoft again. Phil Spencer was very nice and tried to drive me to some people that could help, but everyone was tied-up at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>This is interesting, it seems Valve have lit a small fire under Microsoft once again, as they've been experimenting with a handheld mode for Windows 11 to help devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>To pre-empt complaints from some comments: yeah, I know, this isn't specifically Linux news but things happening in the industry are important.</em></p>
<p>With thanks to Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1646339289230483458" target="_blank">@_h0x0d_</a> noticed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23681492/microsoft-windows-handheld-mode-gaming-xbox-steam-deck" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, they shared what seems to be an internal video from Microsoft developers talking about a Hackathon they did to optimise Windows 11 for handhelds. The important point here, is that it's largely due to the popularity and success of the Steam Deck which ships with SteamOS Linux.</p>
<p>You can get Windows on Steam Deck but it's not exactly supported, with Valve just throwing up the drivers for download that they occasionally update. Valve's focus of course is on SteamOS, where they have all of the control they want for their own device.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8187086201681390575gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8187086201681390575gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured Credit - @_h0x0d_</em></p>
<p>During the Microsoft's developers testing they also worked with another developer to work on <a href="https://github.com/mKenfenheuer/steam-deck-windows-usermode-driver" target="_blank">a project</a> that gives a "windows usermode controller driver for the steam deck internal controller".</p>
<p>It's interesting to see Microsoft developers react to a change in the market like this, although it might never actually become a real thing, it would depend on them gathering more support inside Microsoft to make it happen. Competition is good though, and it might even give Valve perhaps a few ideas or even the KDE team to improve the Plasma Desktop experience.</p>

      <title>Grounded from Obsidian adds Steam Deck support in v1.2.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The survival game Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios is gearing up to launch version 1.2.0 that's now available to test. With it comes Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>It seems that Microsoft / Xbox published titles have been seeing some attention lately, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-gets-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> also recently boosting its Steam Deck support. A sign of more great things to come?</p>
<p>Grounded <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/131791-public-test-patch-notes-for-update-120/" target="_blank">version 1.2.0</a> has hit the stage where it's ready for people to opt-into the Beta, so you can give it a try right now. The patch notes show quite a lot being added and Steam Deck got a special mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Steam Deck Support</h3>
<p>Grounded has been updated to include official Steam Deck support. Fixed issues and improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game now boots past the initial loading screen.</li>
<li>The Xbox log-in window properly displays.</li>
<li>Tuned the default graphics settings for Steam Deck to provide an enjoyable experience. Also includes some Steam Deck-specific optimizations.</li>
<li>Steam Deck virtual keyboard pops up when selecting any input text field in the game (entering a multiplayer game password, naming your trail marker / storage, pet, etc.)</li>
<li>Control prompts no longer flip flop between displaying gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls when using the touch pad or gyro.</li>
<li>Note: <em>The Steam store page will not reflect this official support until after the 1.2 Public Test period is complete.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, you needed various workarounds to be able to actually play the game, as it would freeze on the intro and after that the Xbox login screen also wouldn't work. This patch solves that. Testing it with a fresh install on Proton 7.0-6 (the current main Proton) and yup, it works without an issue getting into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17073059671681388561gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17073059671681388561gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16116363611681388562gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16116363611681388562gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Once version 1.2 is released properly, this will quite likely get Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Testing it on desktop Linux (Fedora KDE), sadly I couldn't reproduce it working with either Proton 7.0-6 or Proton Experimental through repeated runs and trying a few different things but on Steam Deck it was without issues. So hopefully Valve and their Proton developers will figure out what the differences are and get it working, or perhaps even Obsidian can look into why that is.</p>
<p>You can buy Grounded on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi puzzle game Photon Engineer out now, made with open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love puzzle games like Portal and The Talos Principle? Photon Engineer might be one for you to have a look at.</p>
<p>An interesting note about this one and why it's being highlighted: the developer behind it created their own <a href="https://github.com/petitg1987/urchinEngine" target="_blank">open source game engine</a> with Vulkan, and then made this game with it. Seems like quite an impressive feat, while a lot of developers go for an off the shelf game engine. Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>40 levels/platforms to discover.</li>
<li>95 puzzles (45 puzzles with lasers and 50 sliding puzzles).</li>
<li>15 puzzle achievements that extend the game experience.</li>
<li>Each puzzle is unique and provides a new idea.</li>
<li>The further you go, the more complex mechanisms you'll encounter.</li>
<li>Lasers are all marked with symbols for colorblind players.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>X4: Kingdom End and free major upgrade out now, making it Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Egosoft have just released the next major expansion for X4: Foundations named X4: Kingdom End, plus a major free upgrade is also out now that brings full Steam Deck Verified support.</p>
<p>While the game had been given a Steam Deck Verified rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/5309220324014797184" target="_blank">back in March</a>, this was <em>specifically</em> for the Beta of the 6.00 update that only launched today. Confusing really, to have a public store page rating for something people would have to know about and manually opt into, a part of Deck Verified I hope Valve make clearer in future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enjoy a long-awaited reunion with the Boron in X4: Kingdom End, the fourth expansion for X4: Foundations, which completes the collection of the main factions in the X Universe. Discover the unique Boron ships, and fly them through distinctive systems, on a journey of discovery. Visit fascinating places, uncover old secrets and make new acquaintances. Embark on an immersive new chapter of X4!</p>

<p>There's absolutely loads new in the game update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Feature: Updated graphics engine, with Parallax Occlusion Mapping, Reflection Probes, enhanced lighting, improved shadows, and more.</li>
<li>New Feature: Jolt Physics engine.</li>
<li>New Feature: Live Stream camera mode.</li>
<li>New Feature: Position Defence for carrier-led fleets.</li>
<li>New Feature: New Construction Vessel designs for Paranid, Teladi, Split and Terran factions.</li>
<li>Added new bombardment assignment for subordinates.</li>
<li>Added command to order ships to attack surface elements on designated targets.</li>
<li>Added Salvage at Position and Deliver Salvage commands for use with repeat orders.</li>
<li>Added self-destruct command for player-owned satellites, resource probes, nav beacons, lasertowers and mines.</li>
<li>Added detection and penalty for theft from station build storage.</li>
<li>Added more gamestart information, indicating whether they are Tutorial, Guided, Assisted or Sandbox, and adjusted order.</li>
<li>Added option to edit Buccaneer relations in Custom Gamestart Editor under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Added Custom Gamestart Editor story states for Tides of Avarice stories.</li>
<li>Added player HQ to Station Design Simulator.</li>
<li>Added Supervised Mining missions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Driver updates for AMD RADV to give nice boost for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming Mesa driver 23.1 release is sounding like it's going to be pretty great, with the Graphics Pipeline Library ("GPL") being enabled by default, plus we're looking at smaller shader cache sizes too.</p>
<p>We're still around a month away from the release of Mesa 23.1 but that doesn't stop me being excited by it. Going by the current <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/release-calendar.html" target="_blank">roadmap</a>, the estimated release date is May 3rd. When you will get the update will depend on the usual update times for whatever Linux distribution you're on, and for Steam Deck — likely for the next <em>major</em> upgrade.</p>
<p>Merged into the AMD RADV driver in Mesa a couple of days ago, was <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22362" target="_blank">a change</a> to enable GPL by default. What this should do, is much improve the stuttery situation that many games on Linux and Steam Deck face when they don't have a shader cache. You can read a whole lot more about how it works in the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">original announcement</a> post from The Khronos Group who oversee the Vulkan API.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22030" target="_blank">recent addition</a> that was merged into Mesa only a day ago, "re-implements the RADV pipeline cache based on the common vk_pipeline_cache", and as a result the developer noted they saw a <em>reduction</em> in the cache file size by "~60%" for single-file disk-cache and "~2%" <em>increase</em> for multi-file disk-cache "due to the overhead from additional small files".</p>
<p>All this and more was summed up in my recent Steam Deck overview news video:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 announced, plus RTX Remix released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have revealed the GeForce RTX 4070 as the latest in their Ada Lovelace architecture lineup. Plus, there's an initial release of RTX Remix.</p>
<p>For the RTX 4070, NVIDIA claim it gives the ability to "run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution" (although this is when using DLSS). Specifications in comparison to the 4070 Ti, mostly highlighting the bits that are different between them (from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4070-4070ti/" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>

<p>From what NVIDIA say it gives "on average 2.6x faster with DLSS 3" when compared with the RTX 2070 SUPER and "on average 1.4x faster" than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3. NVIDIA also said that in games not using Ray Tracing or DLSS the RTX 4070 is "on par" with the RTX 3080 while "running at nearly half the power — and offering an additional 2GB of memory" plus they've given it 36MB of L2 cache.</p>
<p>When will you be able to get one? The GeForce RTX 4070 will be available from tomorrow priced at $599 / £589.</p>
<p>At least on pricing, it seems a fair bit more reasonable than what NVIDIA has been putting out previously, although it still feels quite inflated. Do mention in the comments what you think to the value of it. Do you think it's worth it?</p>
<p>NVIDIA also additionally just recently tagged the first public release of <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix" target="_blank">RTX Remix</a>, their software to add path-tracing to classic games. It's available under the MIT license, making use of DXVK with their own <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/dxvk-remix/" target="_blank">fork</a>. More about how it works can be read on their <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix/wiki" target="_blank">GitHub Wiki</a>, it's what they used to create <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012840/Portal_with_RTX/" target="_blank">Portal with RTX</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Connect is getting some upgrades for easy file-transfers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Connect is up high on my list of my favourite open source apps, because it makes transferring files between devices (PC / Steam Deck / Mobile) and more real easy. It's been around for a while now and the good news is that it's going to keep getting better.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://albertvaka.wordpress.com/2023/04/11/the-road-to-kde-connect-2-0/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, developer Albert Vaca announced they've been given a grant from the NLnet foundation as part of the NGI Assure fund, which will enable them to work on it full time.</p>
<p>Some of what they have planned includes adding in a mDNS backend for KDE Connect on all supported platforms, to improve device discovery and connections. Beefing up the security is going to be another area they're focusing on with dropping older encryption (that was used for older Android), upgrading various dependencies and ensuring all the latest security patches are in.</p>
<p>Plus they're also going to be looking at accessibility, to ensure the interface is as easy to use as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17465440141681320781gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17465440141681320781gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall it sounds like the future of KDE Connect is looking great.</p>

      <title>Half-Life: Alyx fully playable without VR even on Steam Deck thanks to a mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a few efforts to get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" target="_blank">Half-Life: Alyx</a> playable without VR and the latest is <a href="https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR" target="_blank">HLA-NoVR</a>, out now and it's now possible to play it through, even on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>All you need to do is download it from <a href="https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/downloads/half-life-alyx-novr-script-update-6" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>, and place it into your Alyx install folder, overwriting the existing files and then set "-novr -vsync" as a launch option and yup — it works. The screenshot below is it running on my Fedora KDE desktop, with Proton 7.0-6 and MangoHud as well. I've only tested with Proton, as the Native Linux build hasn't work for me for some time now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1896782131681241500gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1896782131681241500gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking in an <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/news/full-campaign-playable-without-vr-update-out-now" target="_blank">update</a> on Mod DB the developers of the mod said: "This is our biggest update yet and we have no plans on slowing down! With thousands playing Half-Life Alyx NoVR we are happy to announce our largest update yet! As the titles state the entire game can now be played from start to finish, with the Gravity Gloves fully implemented along with combine fabricators providing weapon upgrades. Also since we are now updating the final parts of the game there may be spoilers! We will do our best to not spoil anything while ensuring we communicate these late game areas have been updated along with their gameplay mechanics."</p>
<p>They do still have a whole bunch of stuff left to do, but it's quite impressive what they've been able to achieve. You're also not currently able to get some of the Steam Achievements but it seems a lot of them are possible now (33/42). Even some popular mods for Alyx are playable with this including Levitation, Extra-Ordinary Value, Belomorskaya Station and Overcharge.</p>
<p>You can see in the shot below of Alyx running on my Steam Deck too, and there's even a Steam Input configuration ready for it and it felt quite playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260461811681243024gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260461811681243024gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Half-Life: Alyx in VR is one of my all-time favourite experiences, so it was thoroughly weird going through a little bit of it with this mod.</p>
<p>You can see some of their videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gb_2_" target="_blank">YouTube</a> full of spoilers of course.</p>

      <title>Popular survival roguelike Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead gets a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a rather popular roguelike, quite possibly one of the best, and now it's available on Steam.</p>
<p>This is an official release from the developers too, with the Steam release being handled by one of the developers most involved with maintaining it. Although it's free and open source, the Steam release is paid to hopefully keep development on it going even further.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15341913281681221408gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15341913281681221408gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex and diverse enemies from ever-mutating legions of the undead, to giant insects, to existential horrors from between worlds.</li>
<li>Unparalleled vehicle building and customization system.</li>
<li>Immersive, exquisitely detailed crafting system covering everything from smithing and soldering to keeping your sourdough starter fed.</li>
<li>Build almost anything you can imagine, from a wattle-and-daub shelter in the woods to a tower of reinforced concrete and living alien resin.</li>
<li>Populate your base with NPC allies that help you craft and keep you company.</li>
<li>Explore one of the most detailed and immersive skill and proficiency systems in any RPG.</li>
<li>Ever expanding content, with new major updates released regularly.</li>
<li>Challenging, rewarding game balance that forces you to evaluate every step, or pay the price. You'll soon see why most of the world's population is dead!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you played it? What do you think to it? I know plenty of people who love it and it's in the top 30 survival game list on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc" target="_blank">RPS</a> even. Hopefully the Steam release will make it more accessible than ever, and bring a new audience to it, it's a game that deserves to be played — if the style is your cup of tea. We even had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/cataclysm-dark-days-ahead-is-a-sprawling-foss-apocalypse-roguelike/" target="_blank">contributed article</a> a while ago talking about it.</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2330750/Cataclysm_Dark_Days_Ahead/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development, or via the <a href="https://cataclysmdda.org/" target="_blank">website</a> as before.</p>

      <title>Open Hexagon gets new content plus Linux and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open Hexagon is very much Super Hexagon hyped up to max, open source and just absolutely nuts to play. A fresh upgrade is out now and it sounds great, especially for Linux desktop and Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>In version 2.1.7 the developer mentioned it "adds three new ranked packs, significantly optimizes various aspects of the game's performance, and finally provides a native Linux build that works great out of the box on Steam Deck, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux".</p>
<p>For those that don't know it the idea is simple: survive as long as you can. With only a few buttons to press it's simple enough but incredibly hard to master as you try to avoid all the obstacles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13630854691681218577gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13630854691681218577gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While the game on a basic level was taken from Super Hexagon, the developer of Open Hexagon takes it to a whole different level with multiple new game mechanics to melt your brain like curving and accelerating walls, you really need concentration for this one.

      <title>Minetest 5.7.0 out now with graphics improvements, performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free and open source voxel sandbox game engine <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a>, largely known for comparisons to Minecraft, has a big update out in version 5.7.0. Sounds like a really great release too with plenty of new features and upgrades to the engine.</p>
<p>There's some new graphical features that have been added with post-processing implemented, like bloom and dynamic exposure. The developers said they do plan to add more effects in future like depth-of-field, volumetric lighting and others. Mods and Games will have full control over it all too.</p>
<p>A big performance win is the changes to make better use of your GPU, which they said gives "vastly improved performance on modern hardware at 500+ view ranges". As an example of it they showed a screenshot of it running on Steam Deck with a 600 view range that gives 53FPS whereas before the optimisation it would get 10FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14105411131681217462gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14105411131681217462gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's also been other optimizations done too like the occlusion culling, for not rendering areas that cannot be seen and some more multi-threading has been added too. A nice adjustment for modding is that worlds won't load if a mod doesn't have all of its other content dependencies, instead of just loading with them disabled causing confusion and other problems.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I got a juicy patch with Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's certainly no secret that The Last of Us Part I had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-last-of-us-on-steam-deck-is-not-great/" target="_blank">really bad launch</a> overall and the developer is now trying to improve things. This new patch goes over crash bugs, does a little optimization of texture streaming to reduce CPU usage, some textures not rendering correctly was fixed and a whole lot more. So we're slowly getting closer to the state it should have released in.</p>
<p>Nice to see the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> getting some dedicated attention here too, with it seeing these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where PSO Caching may freeze at 50% completion.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where plugging in a DualSense controller while viewing cutscenes from the Cinematics menu may force a player into gameplay.</li>
<li>Adjusted the user interface to show Steam Deck controls in the Screen Magnifier menu.</li>
<li>Adjusted positioning of the Weapon and Health HUD elements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Full patch notes <a href="https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/14662356357908-The-Last-of-Us-Part-I-v1-0-2-0-Patch-Notes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to playing it through again, either on my Steam Deck or Linux desktop, once it's had a bit more time in the oven. I will be happy when it's sorted, as it's still one of my all-time favourite stories. If you're jumping in again, do let me know in the comments how you find it now.</p>

      <title>EVERSPACE 2 out now, devs focus on Proton for Linux - Steam Deck optimizations planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ROCKFISH Games have now launched EVERSPACE 2 and it looks awesome! One of their original Kickstarter promises did not make it though, with Native Linux support being cancelled as they will support it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> instead.</p>
<p>Despite repeatedly mentioning a Native Linux build would come, even as recently as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/everspace-2-gets-a-steam-deck-and-linux-release-update/" target="_blank">mid February</a>, they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/3695807559244833672" target="_blank">decided not</a> to go through with it. Why? They said Vulkan support in Unreal Engine 4 is "broken and incomplete" and it gave between "50% - 80%" of the performance compared with just running the Windows version in Proton. There were other issues, like VRAM leaks causing crashes. After they spoke with Epic Games, they said it's clear Unreal Engine 4 won't get fixed up with the focus now on Unreal Engine 5 and ROCKFISH don't have the time to fix up the game engine.</p>
<p>They shared a screenshot as a quick example showing the Native build with Vulkan, their Windows build with DXVK and the Windows build with VKD3D-Proton and the performance difference speaks for itself really:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16093829431680863195gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16093829431680863195gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The good news is they plan to ensure it does work well with Proton and they will continue to optimize it there. Any Kickstarter backers not happy can request a refund too which is good to see.</p>
<p>As for Steam Deck, dedicated optimizations for it are also still planned.</p>
<p>For players on other stores like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/everspace_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>, it does make things more complicated, since Steam is the only store to officially support a translation layer like Proton. However, you can try with <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>Report: Steam Deck to pass 3 million sales during 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new <a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2023/04-apr/omdia-steam-deck-installed-base-to-surpass-three-million-during-2023" target="_blank">report</a> from Omdia currently doing the rounds is that the Steam Deck from Valve is set to hit 3 million sales during 2023.</p>
<p>We already knew it had hit at least <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">1 million in 2022</a>, when a KDE developer gave away the figure but Valve actually hasn't talked about the sales figures yet. It's easy to see why Valve aren't announcing any figures — but it seems others will do it for them anyway like this. The report estimates Valve hit about 1.6 million during 2022 and will ship 1.9 million in 2023.</p>
<p>So why don't Valve give out any figures themselves? Valve has always been pretty tight-lipped about details, and this is really no different to their normal operation. They don't need to give out figures either, they're a private company and don't have anyone to please but their own pockets. If they did release regular figures, can you imagine the wider headlines from the major gaming press (and likely other media too)? No doubt it would be instantly talked down like a failure because it's not hitting the levels of the Switch or Xbox.</p>
<p>As we know, it doesn't <em>need</em> to shift multiple millions per month for Valve, since it's part of a single ecosystem where they continue to print money with their 30% cut of Steam games. It doesn't really help though that it's sold in very limited places (mostly via Steam or Komodo), with the only actual retail presence <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">recently announced in Asia</a> and even there it's limited. So when you think it's shifting this many with no traditional retail store presence outside of the previous link talking about a few Asian regions, and still only being available in select countries officially worldwide, it's doing well overall. </p>
<p>Realistically speaking, the Steam Deck is a niche device, especially considering a lot of people using Steam would already have a PC or Laptop to play their games. That said, it does seem to be hitting above its weight, as Valve devs noted over around 42% of people buying one ended up spending the majority of their gaming time with it. Plus, with a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/no-trunext-gen-steam-deck-for-a-few-years-valve-say/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2 likely years away</a>, there's no reason to hold off on picking one up now if you want to play PC games on the go that it enables.</p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It took quite a while for the issues to be figured out but Halo: The Master Chief Collection (MCC) now has improved Steam Deck support. This should also mean it works better on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>While the game did somewhat work for a while, you weren't able to play fully online with others due to problems with Easy Anti-Cheat. Whatever the issues were have been <em>partially</em> solved now so players on Steam Deck can jump into EAC enabled games in multiplayer matchmaking and the Custom Game Browser. In a <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14589112499348" target="_blank">support post</a> on the official site, the developers said that future updates will "continue to improve Steam Deck compatibility as well".</p>
<p>Testing it myself and yup — playing online works just fine:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3426247311680725846gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3426247311680725846gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's some known issues though, like the launch options being <em>backwards</em>, that you need to keep in mind for now until future updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When launching Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam Deck, selecting one of the available Anti-Cheat launch options will result in the game launching with the opposite launch option. For example, selecting “Anti-Cheat Disabled” will result in MCC launching with Anti-Cheat enabled.
<ul>
<li>Until this issue is resolved in a future update, players on Steam Deck must select the “Anti-Cheat Disabled” launch option to access multiplayer matchmaking and the Custom Game Browser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shortly after being removed from or leaving a party with other players via the Roster menu, players on Steam Deck may experience Halo: The Master Chief Collection freezing or crashing.</li>
<li>Players on Steam Deck are unable to play <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403583912084" target="_blank">Campaign Co-op or Spartan Ops</a> with players on PC or Xbox consoles. Attempting to do so may result in players accessing gameplay, however, all sessions will eventually experience a “Connection Interrupted” error or a similar disconnection.
<ul>
<li>Campaign Co-op and Spartan Ops will function as expected if all players in the group are playing on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>By "PC", they of course mean specifically Windows in the above quoted list.</em></p>
<p>For people trying it on Steam Deck for the first time, just be aware it won't automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard to sign in. You need to press STEAM + X to have it appear, and it may take a few taps in the input box to have it actually get focus from the keyboard. Hopefully they work on that too.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky gets another huge update with Interceptor</title>

<p>Some of what's in the update includes: the new procedurally generated Sentinel Interceptor ships you can salvage to add to your collection, corrupted planets to visit full of strange things to discover, VR interface improvements, system authority ships now get procedurally generated, multiple new special corrupted enemies to fight, some enemies can now use cloaking, a new type of jet-pack, new ship components, Sentinel quadruped combat units got a big scary overhaul, new multi-tools, new sentinel capital ship battles and the list goes on…</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the Stellaris 16 (Gen5) for people with money to burn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some spare cash and in the market for a pricey and powerful Linux laptop? TUXEDO would like a word with you for their Stellaris 16 (Gen5). For those of you who want desktop-class performance in something easier to move around, perhaps it might be interesting.</p>
<p>This upgraded model now includes the ability to spec it up to a RTX 4090, which is pretty ridiculous to have in a laptop. It also has a Cherry MX ULP keyboard for much improved typing, although they offer a cheaper silent option too. It has a 240Hz G-SYNC 2560 x 1600 screen and 16GB DDR5 RAM at a minimum too. When it comes to the base configuration you'll get an Intel Core i9-13900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2 x 8 GB DDR5-5600-MHz and a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1195649991680708672gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1195649991680708672gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Connectivity plenty too according to the specs sheet as it comes with a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, Microphone-in, Headpone-out, a SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4 Gen 3, HDMI 2.1, 2.5Gbit LAN and even space to hook up their TUXEDO Aquaris water cooling system.</p>
<p>They seem to be especially hyping up the cooling system on this one, noting it has "6 heatpipes" with a "liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU and GPU" that allows it to hit top performance and stay there claiming it's "superior to the one of typical thin-and-light gaming notebooks and allows for comparatively higher performance or alternatively quieter operation" to provide "outstanding performance for content creation or gaming".</p>
<p>Pricing starts at €1763.87 EUR (excl. VAT). They expect it to become available at the end of April, with pre-orders live now.</p>

      <title>Fanatical and JSAUX team up for Steam Deck game and dock discounts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fanatical and JSAUX have done a little <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1643526757461512192" target="_blank">teaming up</a> between a Steam Deck bundle of games and and some Docking Stations. What's the deal? Well if you shop with either of them, you'll get a voucher for the other.</p>
<p>On the Fanatical side it's on their <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3DPTW" target="_blank">Play On The Go Bundle</a> where you can buy 3, 5 or 8 games together from a selection and get them cheaper and then you'll get a discount voucher to use on a JSAUX Docking Station (models HB0604 or HB0702). The game bundle has these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>198X</li>
<li>Creepy Tale 1 &amp; 2 Double Pack</li>
<li>Cyber Hook</li>
<li>Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Door Kickers: Action Squad</li>
<li>Evan's Remains</li>
<li>Ghost 1.0</li>
<li>Gone Home + Original Soundtrack</li>
<li>Horizon Chase Turbo</li>
<li>Hunted: The Demon's Forge</li>
<li>Iconoclasts</li>
<li>Legends of Kingdom Rush</li>
<li>Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix</li>
<li>PC Building Simulator</li>
<li>Pile Up! Box by Box</li>
<li>Snooker 19</li>
<li>Speed Limit</li>
<li>Splasher</li>
<li>Thunder Wolves</li>
<li>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</li>
<li>Youtubers Life</li>
</ul>
<p>The other side is JSAUX where you can grab either the <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604" target="_blank">HB0604</a> or <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">HB0702</a> Docking Station, and then you'll get a discount voucher to spend at Fanatical (both sides give 10% off). So if you're in need of new games and potentially a Docking Station for the Steam Deck, this might be a good little deal to grab.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently? I've been blasting through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" target="_blank">DOOM</a> (2016) and I'm very close to finishing it. The Steam Deck has been great for getting me to go back through my vast Steam Library. Going to need a break after that though, it's quite intense so I'll perhaps jump into something a bit less full-on for my next game.</p>

      <title>System76 CEO teases in-house Linux laptop code-named &#39;Virgo&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux hardware vendor and creator of the Pop!_OS distribution, <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a>, have made their own desktop for a while now but they're moving onto a custom laptop next. Something they've been planning for some time, as they've gradually scaled up their in-house manufacturing. </p>
<p>On <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141037787618107" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, System76 Founder and CEO Carl Richell, showed off two photos of the panel for the LCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Virgo” is the code name for the laptop we’ll manufacture at our Denver factory. This is the LCD “A” panel milled from thin 6061 aluminum bar stock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12049056341680633701gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12049056341680633701gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14465118761680633703gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14465118761680633703gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click above to enlarge the photos - credit to Richell</em></p>
<p>Clarifying some more details in a reply to a <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@serebit/110141401345257994" target="_blank">question</a> from Budgie desktop developer Campbell Jones, Richell <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141775241580126" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There wouldn't be an ODM or OEM involved in this case but some outside suppliers would make parts for us that we design. We don't have SMT machines for PCBs for instance but we do the EE work. We have laser, mills, brakes, 3D printing, paint, fastener machines and other machines and techniques in the Denver factory. There's a video on our desktops page that shows some of them. <a href="https://system76.com/desktops" target="_blank">https://system76.com/desktops</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, they'll be <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141779272995706" target="_blank">going with</a> the keyboard design from their <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch" target="_blank">Launch</a> keyboard too, so the Launch must have been quite popular for them to stick to the rather different layout.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments releasing May 11th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive confirmed today the Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments DLC will release on May 11th along with a major free update for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ATwJhpy_FQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4737c3f817906b7ddede7299a897f9cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ATwJhpy_FQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main highlights of the DLC include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Grand Tournaments: Host a grand demonstration of feats of arms, attracting nearby nobles and wandering knights. Choose the events, set the destination and use the tournament to improve your social standing or military prowess.</li>
<li>Grand Tours: Take a trip through your realm to take stock of your vassals, gifting them with your benevolence or extorting them for higher taxes.</li>
<li>Grand Weddings: Save your gold for an elaborate ceremony that centers the real meaning of marriage - politics. Honor your in-laws, cater to your vassals and demonstrate your power.</li>
<li>Travel System: Plan your route to these great activities, choosing safety through civilized lands or risking everything for a more direct route through dark forests or dangerous mountains. Ease your way with a large entourage that marks your importance or travel light so you can get down to business.</li>
<li>Knightly Accolades: Honor your best knights with special titles and accolades that will give bonuses to them and the armies they lead.</li>
<li>New Armor Designs: New historical armor designs from across the centuries, integrated with the new Tournament and Accolade systems.</li>
<li>New Western Clothing: New art for clothing designs will show how fashions changed and evolved in Western Europe from the time of the Carolignians to the closing of the medieval era.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Paradox have also given out some info about "Chapter II", a planned series of extra content coming which you can purchase that will include all of these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments</strong>: Join great adventures and activities. Take a tour of your realm to check in on your vassals face-to-face. Host grand tournaments to demonstrate your wealth or military prowess. Impress your friends and rivals with great royal weddings. But, no matter the activity, keep an eye out for schemes, as nothing is better than a party to cloak ill-intentions.</li>
<li><strong>Wards and Wardens</strong>: In this pack, new events add greater depth and interaction to the challenges of raising and educating children. Whether parent, tutor or warden, the personalities of the child and the adult may clash as headstrong or determined children resist the knowledge of their betters. Strong guidance, however, can lead to a lifelong bond across the generations.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Persia</strong>: This forthcoming addition for Crusader Kings III lets you relive the dramatic struggle for survival and empire in the lands between the Euphrates and the Indus. With special attention to the culture and history of medieval Persia, Legacy of Persia introduces new systems for Clan government rulers, and expands on the Islamic and Zoroastrian religions dominant in the region at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Elegance of the Empire</strong>: You can dress your Central European characters in the finest of finery with this clothing pack exclusive to owners of Chapter II for Crusader Kings III. Inspired by the historic regalia of the 11th century rulers Emperor Henry II and Empress Cunigunde of the Holy Roman Empire, this pack includes not only new robes and dresses, but historically appropriate crowns and other regalia.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By itself Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments costs $29.99 / £24.99 / €29.99 or you can buy Chapter II for $34.99 / £29.50 / €34.99 to get all of it.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us now Unsupported on Steam Deck, bad look for Valve and Naughty Dog</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's official, Valve put The Last of Us Part 1 through Deck Verified and gave it an Unsupported status on Steam Deck. Not really a good look for either Valve or Naughty Dog.</p>
<p>Before release, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said pretty clearly on <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1601694903724953600" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Ellie and Joel will grace the Steam Deck… don’t worry!". However, Druckmann didn't exactly say when, so I suppose the statement isn't exactly false just yet? Worse though, is that Valve began using it in their Steam Deck clips on the official Steam Deck <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and it's even still showing it today:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12472031531680608102gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12472031531680608102gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty misleading isn't it? While it only shows briefly, it's a very well known scene in the game (and the TV show…), that plus Druckmann's statement together aren't great, no doubt some people pre-ordered it based on the hype surrounding it. Especially a nuisance given how specifically on Steam Deck, half the refund window was taken up by it doing the shaders.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-last-of-us-on-steam-deck-is-not-great/" target="_blank">rather disappointed</a> with the situation. It's not just the Steam Deck performance though, the game as a whole had a really rough launch on PC in a clear case of another game just being released too early. There's been quite a few bigger games launching in a state over the last year but at least they weren't being hyped up for the Steam Deck in the way this was. Hopefully both Valve and Naughty Dog will reflect on this.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog have said on <a href="https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1643025458232180737" target="_blank">Twitter</a> yesterday, April 3rd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reminder that we will have a new hotfix live for The Last of Us Part I on PC tomorrow, and a patch on Friday.</p>
<p>We will share patch notes when the hotfix is live, and let you know some of what to expect in Friday's patch ahead of its launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the follow-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And while we know many of you would like to play The Last of Us Part I on Steam Deck, we are prioritizing fixes and patches before submitting it for verification.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated of its Steam Deck status as we continue to improve the PC version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Kinda amusing their note about verification but Valve ran it through anyway…</em></p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.7.0 is out now for Epic Games and GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher has a brand new release available for helping you manage Epic Games, GOG and more on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Easily one of my favourite open source projects! It doesn't just help you deal with Epic and GOG though, since you can add anything else into it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14072729971680606812gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14072729971680606812gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main new features in Heroic version 2.7.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Auto Install UbisoftConnect when running UbisoftConnect games.</li>
<li>UI improvements on the GamePage to make it cleaner and organized.</li>
<li>Library render improvements and download GOG game images in the background.</li>
<li>Improve <code class="inline-code">pc/applegamingwiki</code> accuracy and add <code class="inline-code">gamesdb</code> info.</li>
<li>Improvements on Epic Login.</li>
<li>macOS binaries now are signed with an Apple Developer certificate.</li>
<li>Translations update.</li>
<li>Show game logs from the card's context menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous bug fixes were also included like a fix for shortcut names, Discord integration, auto-enabling anti-cheat runtimes, properly stop all Wine processes when closing a game and more.</p>
<p>See all on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.7.0" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>
<p>It can also be used on Windows and macOS and even <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heroic-games-launcher-vs-epic-games-launcher/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> seem to love using it, noting how they're enjoying it on Steam Deck and how it loads so much quicker than the official Epic Games app on Windows too. Nice to see many more people appreciate open source projects like this.</p>

      <title>Hell Let Loose planning Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The hardcore FPS Hell Let Loose had a 2023 roadmap reveal, and they've confirmed they're planning to add Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>It uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which has been the problem in running it currently as developers need to manually enable it for Linux / Steam Deck. Even though Valve worked with Epic Games to ensure both the newer EOS version and the older version of EAC are supported, it's not always as easy as just hitting a button and making sure things are in the right place. As we've seen from Halo MCC and others, sometimes it just doesn't work, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>At least in this case, Steam Deck support is firmly on their roadmap, which a target for September:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9451743611680600045gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9451743611680600045gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So I'll be following it along, to keep you informed on any developments there. No doubt it will use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> (not Native). September is still a while away so it gives them plenty of time for testing and figuring out any problems and gives Valve even more time to improve Proton further too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck mention is at about 6:26:</p>

      <title>Asus announce the ROG Ally gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More companies are beginning to see there is a market for a PC gaming handheld, with Asus planning to release the ROG Ally. Initially, this seemed like an April Fools joke but it turned out to be real.</p>
<p>For the GamingOnLinux readership it might not be exactly what you're going to instantly sign up for, since it will be coming with Windows 11, but it's interesting to see more companies jump in and no doubt after a while Linux drivers will appear like they do for pretty much everything. We may even see Valve support it with their <em>eventual</em> release of SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>Coming in a bit smaller than the Steam Deck with no touchpads, it will limit what you're able to play a bit more but it will have a 16:9 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a custom AMD APU they claim is the "fastest yet", a dual-fan design and eGPU support. Asus claim it will offer double the performance on the Steam Deck but they're not giving out any tech specs or battery life details.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s5lq4Q7YAjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e691c224fbd3dd63c8be4bd4164aed6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s5lq4Q7YAjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Asus are a much bigger name than the likes of AYANEO, GPD and Onexplayer so they could potentially offer prices a bit lower since they're likely able to take on a bit more of the costs. Naturally though, they will still have to price it at a point where it makes enough money to be profitable to a point where it makes sense, so I still expect it to be a fair bit higher than the Steam Deck pricing since they can't make up for it by the 30% cut Valve get from Steam games.</p>
<p>LinusTT and Dave2D managed to take a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="drLZxyv79Oo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/abc0e73469cb3db8d4d5986fe53c3846.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/drLZxyv79Oo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9a3oAiN2ik"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/243875d4adfc1aadff50ec7a660ba827.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9a3oAiN2ik" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're only prototypes right now, so there's of course every chance that Asus <em>don't</em> actually end up releasing it but given how far along it is, I imagine they will. You can follow it on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus/learn-about-rog-ally/pcmcat1678398541884.c" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> if you want to be notified of when it's available, no word yet on availability in various regions.</p>
<p>Given how Valve have clearly said there's no planned Steam Deck refresh for some time, as they're waiting for it to be truly worth it, this is the closest I've been to believing it has some <em>real</em> competition. It all depends on the price.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 23.04 &#39;Lunar Lobster&#39; Beta released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next major update for Ubuntu Linux is about to arrive, with the Beta of Ubuntu 23.04 'Lunar Lobster' now available. With the final release scheduled for April 20th, this will be one of the last times you can test for issues before the main release.</p>
<p>One of the major changes is their new installer, which is a Flutter snap, although the original installer is still around for people that have issues with the new one.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20386171871680539634gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20386171871680539634gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The majority of the user-facing changes are from their <a href="https://release.gnome.org/44/" target="_blank">GNOME 44</a> upgrade though, so you should hopefully get a better performing desktop, along with the enhanced Quick Settings menu and lots more. My favourite feature there is that after years of waiting, there's finally thumbnails in the GNOME file picker (if the app is using GTK4). Hopefully more applications will upgrade to take advantage of the upgraded file picker.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441431141680540592gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441431141680540592gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Of course there's lots of other updated software included like Linux kernel 6.2, Firefox 111, LibreOffice 7.5.2, Thunderbird 102.9, BlueZ 5.66, NetworkManager 1.42, Pipewire 0.3.65, Poppler 22.12 and xdg-desktop-portal 1.16. They're also still testing their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/canonical-want-help-testing-their-steam-snap-package-for-ubuntu/" target="_blank">new Steam snap</a>.</p>
<p>You can download the Beta below, depending on which you wish to test:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/23.04/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/23.04/beta/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Budgie</a></li>

      <title>Couch gaming Linux distro ChimeraOS 41 out now, better AYANEO and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a PC hooked up to your TV or need a Linux distribution that might work better on a handheld PC? A new release of <a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is here, and it's a necessary upgrade. Think of it a bit like SteamOS with fancy extras.</p>
<p>ChimeraOS 40 and 41 released quickly after are needed, because the boot system has changed and if you don't update to it, you <em>won't</em> be able to update to ChimeraOS 42 when it comes out. The developer also mentioned that if you're on a BIOS/legacy boot, to do a fresh install for the new bootloader.</p>
<p>ChimeraOS 41 uses a Linux kernel version 6.1.21, Mesa version 22.3.4 (patched for ANV compatibility with Gamescope) and NVIDIA driver version: 530.41.03.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switched to the systemd-boot bootloader for new installations. BIOS/legacy installations are no longer supported.</li>
<li>Added a migrations framework to the system updater in preparation for migrating existing installations to systemd-boot in a future release.</li>
<li>Switched to PCSX2 emulator core for PlayStation 2 games. A BIOS file is now required.</li>
<li>Added support for Super Game Boy and Atari 7800 games.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Deck failing to boot.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Deck audio.</li>
<li>Added full controller support for AYANEO 2 and AYANEO Geek models via HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Reduced network timeouts in the game configuration downloader to avoid connection hangs in poor network conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed automatic disk mounting in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Wake on USB will now be automatically enabled when a gamepad is plugged in.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where session changes would not persist after a reboot.</li>
<li>Added an Xorg desktop session option.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where game configuration tweaks were not being applied on first boot.</li>
<li>Added the ability to override the exe file used to launch GOG games. WarCraft II now works.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam failing to start with some displays at 4K when using AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed formatting and mounting of secondary storage devices in Steam.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Windy Meadow expands on the fantastic text-adventure Roadwarden this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roadwarden is a really quite fantastic illustrated text-based RPG, and now the world is set to expand in a big way with Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale. They're going with a completely different style this time though, and it appears to be far less text-heavy while still blending in elements of an illustrated visual novel. Seems like it could be interesting.</p>
<p>The story: "Over the course of three interwoven stories, players will be introduced to protagonists Vena, Fabel, and Ludicia, three citizens of the sleepy and serene village Windy Meadow, as they navigate grand life choices regarding their futures. </p>
<p>Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P6VRhcTW3k4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f154fdc69f41cde440a0a49f8d1f2ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P6VRhcTW3k4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Story Unfolds: </strong>Unlike most visual novels, Window Meadow replaces the majority of narration with animated character sprites. More than 99% of the in-game text represents dialogues.</li>
<li><strong>Three Protagonists: </strong>Follow three very different protagonists and uncover their problems, fears, and the challenges they face. Their varying personalities make for interesting and complicated relationships with the multitude of moody side characters.</li>
<li><strong>Choices Matter: </strong>From the seemingly small to the life-changing, choices players make can affect dialogue options, NPC feelings, and game endings.</li>
<li><strong>(Mostly) Harmonious Living: </strong>Enjoy a serene storyworld rich in gorgeous views, gentle rivers, fertile lands, and welcoming forests. In Windy Meadow, even the beasts and dragons tend to keep their distance. But raiders, on the other hand…</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Epic Online Services for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah yes, launchers and external online services, what a nuisance they can be for Steam Deck and Linux desktop players. Thankfully, Valve keep working away on Proton to fix up issues. Remember <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/prepare-to-see-a-lot-more-of-epic-online-services-with-epics-new-self-publishing/" target="_blank">recently I wrote about</a> how you might see a whole lot more games using Epic Online Services? Well, like what happened with the EA App breaking lots of games, it happened to EOS too.</p>
<p>Valve put up an update to <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">Proton Experimental</a> on March 31st with these fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix EOS services failing to update for Fall Guys, Returnal and other games. This may require Proton prefix to be re-created.</li>
<li>Fix recent experimental regression that made THE KING OF FIGHTERS XV start to a black screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above, you may need to re-do the Proton prefix for the EOS fix. On Steam Deck, you can do this by picking a game in your Steam Library going into Properties -&gt; Developer -&gt; Delete Proton files. On Desktop Linux, you'll need to find the game's ID in the steamapps -&gt; "compatdata" folder to remove it. This can potentially cause a loss in save files though, if games don't sync online.</p>
<p>For an explanation of all the different Proton versions see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my original guide on Proton</a>. Proton Experimental gets automatically installed if Valve set it on a game, or you can just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library (<em>not</em> the Steam Store) to install it. </p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p><strong>Text guide</strong></p>
<p>Change it per game (Steam Deck)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included gets a new animated short, plus fun with Meteors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is a space-colony builder and probably one of the best. Space is dangerous and of course there's going to be Meteors but now you can have a bit more fun with them.</p>
<p>Not only have they now included options to let you adjust Meteor Showers, so you can adjust their intensity, you can now also construct a building to that will blow them up when they get close. Of course it needs ammo too, so you have to create projectiles for it too. A new long-dead critter has been introduced too in the form of Fossils, so it seems we'll need to be careful when going digging now and you can assemble the full skeleton to unlock a big cache of resources.</p>
<p>There's also weekly blueprint drops, that will unlock during gameplay. The developer said you should get everything included in ~6 hours play time. Check out the new animated short too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lJPAdlLMU6w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ec1b804ea6a4d04739a7c261dcf9961f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lJPAdlLMU6w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified. Think I might have to spend a whole lot more time with this, having it working so well on Steam Deck is awesome.</p>

      <title>Humble has a bundle of Survivors-Like games, including Boneraiser Minions (a favourite)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's your chance to jump into the Survivors-Like games phenomenon, so I guess that's what we're calling games like Vampire Survivors now? Survivors-Like? Humble Bundle <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-survivorslike?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">has some good picks here</a> but I do find it mildly amusing they didn't manage to pull in the game that started the recent trend for a "best of" bundle.</p>
<p>Going over each title I'll give you the support status across Steam Deck and Linux desktop (either Proton or Native Linux). Here's what you get:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Boneraiser Minions <em>(personal favourite)</em></p>

<p>Overall, a pretty great bundle of games for the price, one not to miss out on in my opinion. Sure is a lot of these games coming along, although we might not yet agree on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">what to call them</a>. You can see a previous video I did on Boneraiser Minions below:</p>

      <title>Stop an organism spreading and protect humanity in Xenospore, now with a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free game Xenospore sees you try to stop the spread of a strange and deadly organism and there's a big upgrade out now. At a very basic level it sort of reminds me of Into the Breach because of the small tile-based world, and the alien stuff. It's very different though. Mentioned here on GamingOnLinux back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/defend-humanity-from-an-alien-organism-in-puzzle-game-xenospore/" target="_blank">September last year</a>, it's come a long way.</p>
<p>You go through 40 levels destroying world tiles to prevent the organism spreading, and then cleansing tiles that have been infected before they become food. It has some great looking pixel-art and the atmosphere on it is perfect.

      <title>Dark sci-fi roguelike Deadnaut: Signal Lost looks great and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadnaut: Signal Lost from the developer of Deadnaut, Zafehouse Diaries and Fear Equation is officially out now with Native Linux support. A game that was mentioned here on GamingOnLinux just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/developer-of-deadnaut-signal-lost-requests-linux-testers/" target="_blank">recently</a>, as the developer was looking for Linux testers. As they promised, a proper demo is also now available along with the full release.</p>
<p>"In this slick, fast-paced roguelike you’ll take control of a single Deadnaut, unlock suit upgrades and abilities, fight cosmic horrors, and investigate drifting wrecks and abandoned moons. But remember: your Deadnaut is not your friend – earn their trust, do your job well, and they might return the favour."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b0pswW5arCQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e8a1e69d3e1571b743c942fc51b2fca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b0pswW5arCQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FAST ROGUELIKE GAMEPLAY - Guide your Deadnaut through procedurally generated missions, from floating cryoships and freighters to abandoned settlements, equipping them with a wide array of weapons, upgrades and gear. Fight when you can, run when you must.</li>
<li>TRUST ISSUES - Keep your Deadnaut loyal or force compliance. Pay them off or turn them into a mindless space golem if necessary, but remember: <em>everything comes at a price</em>.</li>
<li>FIVE DISTINCT SUITS AND PLAYSTYLES - Select from five suits, each with dozens of unique skills and abilities. Customise your Deadnaut with weapons, sensors, shields, cloaks and hack tools. Choose from the heavy-duty Labour suit, the ghostly Sensor suit, or the gravity-bending Energy suit, or other playstyles to match your preferences.</li>
<li>TACTICS, UPGRADES, AND CUSTOMISATION - Develop your Deadnaut and maximise their potential by discovering powerful combinations and synergies among 180+ upgrades. Tailor your armour and damage to face the challenges that await you in the twisted depths of the Rip.</li>
<li>THE HUNT IS ON - Stay one step ahead of the Benefactors, an enigmatic enemy in relentless pursuit, determined to stop you from reaching the Rip's source. Armed with advanced tech, weapons and cunning, you'll need to keep your wits about you to evade their grasp.</li>
<li>CREATE YOUR OWN DEADNAUT - Get started with a premade Deadnaut or create your own unique character. Adjust their stats and even import your own photo to truly make your Deadnaut your own.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really loving the presentation on this one, giving you a claustrophobic feel that heightens the tension and reminds me in a way of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/space-sci-fi-drone-sim-duskers-hits-five-years-dev-talks-sales-and-returns-to-indie/" target="_blank">Duskers</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari DLC releases April 13th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if it hasn't sucked away enough of our free time already right? Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari is arriving on April 13th. Giving you a bunch more content at a small price of $1.99 / €1.99 / £1.59.</p>
<p>This is the second DLC for the ridiculously popular auto-attacking action survival game, with the first DLC Legacy of the Moonspell being thoroughly well received by players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9188860131680284014gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9188860131680284014gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Nestled deep within a continent-sized forest is Foscari Academy, a school where the elite of the world train their children for careers as powerful wizards, indefatigable generals, and expert spies. The Academy is divided into three houses, a premise hitherto untouched in all of fantasy fiction. Three students, one from each house, brave the journey into a forest stuffed with mythological creatures, all to have a jolly adventure, with absolutely nothing interrupting the whimsy. This is all mind-blowingly original stuff, we know, but it only gets better folks."</p>
<p>What to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8 allegedly never seen before characters.</li>
<li>13 new weapons between base versions and evolutions. Including the sword, the arrow, and the magic.</li>
<li>1 large stage: a forest called Lake.</li>
<li>7 brand new music tracks.</li>
<li>21 achievements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2iZVpnu5Dmc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/daaa9d7bcd634abc08b0e4519ae29312.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2iZVpnu5Dmc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers are still working away on their port to Unity, which is now available in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1794680/discussions/3/5769714637082190371/?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">opt-in Beta</a>. Looks like the Native Linux build is there and up to date too. This should hopefully solve some of their performance problems, along with giving them a solid foundation to keep building on and make porting easier in the long run.</p>

      <title>Vulkan gets a new extension to improve shaders with help from Nintendo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is a fair bit unexpected. As happens quite often there was a specification update to the Vulkan API, and with it came a brand new extension to help with shaders — which Nintendo contributed towards.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/developers-developers-developers/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from driver developer Mike Blumenkrantz, and also a full <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/you-can-use-vulkan-without-pipelines-today" target="_blank">announcement</a> from The Khronos Group who oversee the Vulkan API. The official Vulkan announcement post was even written by a developer from Nintendo. Notes from the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, Khronos® is releasing a new multi-vendor Vulkan® extension that aims to radically simplify how applications specify shaders and shader state while maintaining Vulkan’s ethos of being a highly performant “API without secrets.”</p>
<p>This extension is <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_shader_object.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_shader_object</a>. It introduces a new VkShaderEXT object type which represents a single compiled shader stage, along with 4 new functions to manipulate and use VkShaderEXT objects.</p>
<p>Shader objects serve a role similar to pipelines but expose a simpler, more flexible interface designed to empower applications whose architectures and/or needs for “dynamism” might have previously made the use of pipelines difficult. In environments where VK_EXT_shader_object is supported, applications can choose to use only pipelines, only shader objects, or an arbitrary mix of the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post goes into details on what it does, and how it's the "culmination of years of work to bring Vulkan developers ever more powerful and easier-to-use ways to manage shaders and state". They're urging developers who overlooked Vulkan in the past due to being intimidated by it to perhaps give it another look.</p>
<p>And according to the blog post from Blumenkrantz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a very cool extension for Zink. Effectively, it means (unoptimized) shader variants can be generated very fast. So fast that the extension should solve all the remaining issues with shader compilation and stuttering by enabling applications (zink) to create and bind shaders directly without the need for pipeline objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it's going to be a big win overall, and could result in performance gains in some cases and less stuttering.</p>
<p>To go along with it, NVIDIA already have a new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> available with support added.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release details of security issues and release new drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA issued a new Security Bulletin, to advise you to update your GPU drivers due to multiple security issues discovered. This bulletin went out today with the email arriving in my inbox moments ago, so here's the details of the issues that affect Linux.</p>
<p>Firstly all driver versions <em>below</em> these are affected: 530.41.03, 525.105.17, 515.105.01 and 470.182.03. So make sure you upgrade if you're on a driver below the version number listed there in each series. The driver actual series doesn't matter, they fixed it it all listed.</p>
<p>Here's what issues affected just Linux or Windows and Linux together:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-0189 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.;</li>
<li>CVE‑2023‑0184 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0181 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in a kernel mode layer handler, where memory permissions are not correctly checked, which may lead to denial of service and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0191 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds access may lead to denial of service or data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0183 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer where an out-of-bounds write can lead to denial of service and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0180 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in a kernel mode layer handler, which may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0185 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where sign conversion issues may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0198 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0187 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds read can lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0199 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds write can lead to denial of service and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0190 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where a NULL pointer dereference may lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0188 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unprivileged user can cause an out-of-bounds read, which may lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0194 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer driver, where an invalid display configuration may lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0195 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer driver, where an invalid display configuration may lead to information disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Driver versions <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/202484/en-uk" target="_blank">525.105.17</a> and <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/200663/en-uk" target="_blank">470.182.03</a> were released today, which along with the security fixes also address other issues (other drivers already out had the fixes). For driver 525.105.17 this is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when resetting the display layout.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause excessive GPU power consumption at idle when driving multiple displays with a high refresh rate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in nvidia-powerd which could cause excessive CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which could cause applications to run at 1 FPS when using an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink as the only active display.</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Linux kernels with Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause fullscreen PRIME Render Offload applications and/or X to crash when an NVIDIA GPU is driving multiple displays with Reverse PRIME.</li>
<li>Added support for console restoration when using simpledrm.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-modprobe to create symbolic links in /dev/char when creating the /dev/nvidia* device nodes. This resolves an issue that prevented the device nodes from working with newer versions of runc:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/" target="_blank">https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And for 470.182.03:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where HDMI audio output was not working in some cases, especially with high display refresh rates (120Hz, 100Hz, etc.) using Fixed Rate Link (FRL) transmission mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stories from the Outbreak from Coldwild Games, an indie game development company from Latvia, creators of "Merchant of the Skies", "Luna's Fishing Garden" and the "Lazy Galaxy" series hits Early Access.</p>
<p>The game is set in 2020, with a new disease sweeping through the world (huh — sounds familiar). Zombies rise up, attack and you get the rest, everything goes to hell. You wake up and hear on the radio there's one last ferry to get away, and so it begins.</p>
<p>With it now in Early Access (along with Native Linux support), the developer mentioned the current version has a shorter scenario than what will be featured in the full game. You'll get to see 11 unique characters, more than 15 enemies, and three expansive maps to explore. Planned features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Form a team of survivors, hoping to escape the doomed city. Decide the fates of your team members as you go.</li>
<li>Characters talk between themselves, showing polarization in views. Not every team is going to reach the ferry, but their stories matter. Will different views prevent them from reaching their goals?</li>
<li>Escape the dying world: traverse the area maps in search of shelter and supplies.</li>
<li>Fight zombies when necessary: there are more than 15 unique enemy types in the game.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Europa Universalis IV: Domination releasing April 18th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox has confirmed the Europa Universalis IV: Domination expansion is now releasing on April 18th. This is a full add-on too, not a small story pack.</p>
<p>In this add-on for the popular grand strategy game you will get a bunch of additions for some of the most popular and powerful nations available. This includes entirely new mission trees, historical government reforms, estate challenges and units to add greater variety and sometimes, tough choices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Some of what's new:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ottoman Empire: </strong>A revised conquest tree with new rewards for pushing Ottoman dominance, including expansion through the new Eyalet system, and new internal changes, such as the new Janissary estate, the new Ottoman Decadence mechanic, and the ‘Ottoman Power Struggle’ disaster.</li>
<li><strong>China: </strong>Different mission trees for the Han Ming and invader empires like the Qing. Choose between expansion and Inward Perfection, and counter the power of the Eunuchs to build a more stable empire.</li>
<li><strong>Japan: </strong>Unite Japan as you deal with the power of the Shogun and the independent Daimyos. Choose to open the country to foreign influence or keep it isolated, while deciding upon different paths of expansion and reform.</li>
<li><strong>Russia: </strong>Free your country of the Tatar Yoke, and transform it into a Great Empire. Choose the path of Peter’s reforms to modernize the state, so your mission tree as well as your mechanics will change and evolve as the game progresses. Use the power of Cossacks and Streltsy to expand your Empire to East and West.</li>
<li><strong>Spain: </strong>Expanded mission trees for Castile and Aragon, with different paths to form Spain, a new mechanic available for the new ‘System of Councils’ government, and decisions about the Army and Navy to get the mighty Tercios and Spanish Armada.</li>
<li><strong>France: </strong>Fight the end of the Hundred Years War, centralize France into an absolute monarchy while dealing with the Wars of Religion, expand into Italy and the Holy Roman Empire, and lead the Revolution through an expanded mission tree.</li>
<li><strong>Great Britain: </strong>Separate paths for either a British Empire or an Angevin Britain, as well as a deeper internal gameplay, with unique features for the English Parliament  and changes to the English Civil War disaster.</li>
<li><strong>Minor nations: </strong>Mission changes, new government mechanics and expanded flavor for Prussia, Portugal and Korea.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Retro racer Super Indie Karts got upgraded with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Super Indie Karts already had Native Linux support, it's nice to see another developer making improvements for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>More about it: "Super Indie Karts is a classic retro '90s style karting game featuring a large curation of Indiegame karts and Indiegame themed race tracks, in both the 16-bit flat Super style and the 64-bit low poly Ultra style. With Time Trials, Grand Prix, Splitscreen GP, Quick Race, and a few Battle Modes.. there's plenty of ways to tackle the tracks!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20751910441680176570gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20751910441680176570gol1.jpeg"/></a>Screenshot of me testing it on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>In their March 2023 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/323670/view/6383330087928345070" target="_blank">update</a> the developer made these improvements and it's now Steam Deck Verified too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 16:10 ratio resolutions to the settings, giving a better view on devices such as Steam Deck.</li>
<li>New resolutions include: 640x400, 960x600, 1280x800, 1440x900, 1680x1050, 1920x1200, 2560x1600, and 3840x2400.</li>
<li>Added Steam Deck controller glyphs.</li>
<li>Improvements to First Person View giving much tighter feeling of control.</li>
<li>Moved camera a little further away from kart in mode7 tracks, less cramped feeling now.</li>
<li>Added more freedom to the splitscreen cameras so multiplayer feels more like single player again, still more work to do here on drifting.</li>
<li>Fixed rapid selection problem changing resolution from settings menu in races.</li>
<li>Fixed some navigation help in TeslaTowerII.</li>
<li>Fixed TeslaTower64 being near impossible on 200cc.</li>
<li>Fixed lighting issues in TeslaTowerII and Burrito Bison's Candyland Arena.</li>
<li>Added colour navigation hint to stairwell windows in BattleMania track FourFloors.</li>
<li>Raised/lowered music volume level in a few tracks.</li>
<li>Fixed trophies not having reflections in their material on the podium screen.</li>
<li>Various under-the-hood bug fixes, far too many to mention.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually available for the next 6 days in the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/kart-racers-games-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Kart Racers Humble Bundle</a> too. Or you can get it direct <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/323670/Super_Indie_Karts/" target="_blank">from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Pale Beyond sold 10% of copies on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting data point for you, The Pale Beyond a polar exploration game set in an unforgiving frozen wasteland managed to do well on the Steam Deck. Released back in February from Bellular Studios, it is Steam Deck Verified and on desktop Linux it has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1266030" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>Not seen it before, do check out their trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PvvkUPPJc_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43b8bf455e2b842c9ddac4ce293696c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PvvkUPPJc_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the game: "When its sister ship failed to return from a dangerous polar expedition, a crew is assembled for a perilous rescue mission aboard The Temperance. When the Captain mysteriously disappears after the ship becomes stuck in the ice, players will be forced into Captaincy and manage the 24 crewmates (and 12 sled dogs!). Keeping the crew and sled dogs safe, fed, and warm is key. However, surviving the ice will matter little in the face of mutiny. Every vote will count, so keep the crew on your side."</p>
<p>They also run the Bellular News YouTube channel, where they talk about the gaming industry. In a video posted up on March 29th, a section talked a bit about the game and mentioned clearly how it had sold 10% of copies on the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck part starts at 5:10 to quote: "I can actually give you a very interesting number from our game, The Pale Beyond and it really shocked me. So 10% of The Pale Beyond sales are actually Steam Deck".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e3sZRzUHbPc?rel=0&amp;start=312"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3516fc8230b94ca9b269c828d8f39ea1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e3sZRzUHbPc?rel=0&amp;start=312" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly looks interesting, going to have to take a look at this one myself!</p>
<p>You can buy a copy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-pale-beyond?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266030/The_Pale_Beyond/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Blender 3.5 is out now with fancy new hair</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to show how great open source is, the Blender team have released <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-5/" target="_blank">Blender 3.5</a> with some really fancy new features. Blender is used across many different industries from games to films and more.</p>
<p>This release massively advances the curves-based hair system they released originally with Blender 3.3, bringing with it a whole bunch of built-in assets for modellers to play with. Not just for human hair either, they said it can be used for all sorts like fur and even grass. From what they explained it allows you to do some really varied styled with it thanks to being able to manipulate hair rather finely.</p>
<p>Check out this fancy new system in their official video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_-d0HaT5f1g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b75a14a4486d5d8b78eb5945447bf015.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_-d0HaT5f1g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Various other feature highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cycles now uses a light tree to more effectively sample scenes with many lights. This can significantly reduce noise, at the cost of a somewhat longer render time per sample.</li>
<li>Open Shading Language (OSL) can now be used with OptiX on the GPU, in addition to existing support with CPU rendering.</li>
<li>A new GPU-based compositor backend, so you do modelling while the compositor and effects are on. Sounds and looks like a huge advancement!</li>
<li>UV Copy and UV Paste support added.</li>
<li>Support for importing and exporting with USDZ.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements for glTF 2.0 support.</li>
<li>Loads more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Full release <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/3.5" target="_blank">notes here</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to collect creatures? How about transforming into them? Okay how about fusing them together? Cassette Beasts is what you need then.</p>
<p>I won't hide any excitement over this one, I absolutely adore the idea behind it and the visual style. Bringing back good memories of the classics I grew up with playing late night on Game Boy in bed (many forms of Pokemon…) but with a nice modern refresh to it.</p>
<p>The developers just announced it's releasing on April 26th with a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JBt-B5eT2h4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2502a06b4116d70625213ebe1204837.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JBt-B5eT2h4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?! Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li>Fuse monster forms! Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li>Explore a rich open world - Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions - Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li>Master a deep battle system - Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
<li>Play couch-co op with Friends - Team up in local multiplayer with a friend to explore an open world, transform and battle together! Facing the unknown as a duo will surely develop your relationship!</li>
</ul>

      <title>OBS Studio 29.1 Beta 1 brings AV1 / HEVC over RTMP</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on the free and open source video recording and livestreaming software OBS Studio, have released the first Beta for version 29.1 with a big new feature.</p>
<p>With this being the first that supports the AV1 and HEVC over RTMP, currently just for streaming to YouTube. This is a big step, because there's a huge amount of interest in the likes of AV1 as it can provide better quality with a lower bandwidth cost.</p>
<p>Here's what else is new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a DLL blocking feature for Windows. This allows OBS to block problematic DLLs from attaching to OBS and causing freezing or crashes, for example 3rd party overlay hooks and outdated video capture devices. [notr1ch]
<ul>
<li>This blocks old versions of popular VTubing software virtual cameras that are known to cause freezes when accessing video capture device properties. If you are affected, please update to the latest version of your VTubing software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Update Channels on macOS and updated Sparkle for smaller and faster updates going forward [derrod]</li>
<li>Added settings to select the audio encoder for streaming and recording [tytan652]</li>
<li>Added an option to preload media sources used in Stingers to memory, to avoid frame skips during transitions [Jim]</li>
<li>Added compatibility notices in the Window and Game Capture sources for Windows [derrod]</li>
<li>Added the ability to zoom browser docks with Ctrl - and + and the right click menu [WizardCM]</li>
<li>Added a setting to record in fragmented MP4 and MOV formats [derrod]
<ul>
<li>These offer greater compatibility than MKV while providing similar resilience against data loss due to crashes, running out of space, etc.</li>
<li>Fragmented MP4 and MOV files can be remuxed to regular MP4/MOV in cases where the former may not be read correctly (e.g. in older editing software)</li>
<li>The default recording format has been tentatively changed to fragmented MP4/MOV, please submit your feedback on Discord or the Forums if you run into any issues!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for surround sound for AJA capture cards [paulh-aja]</li>
<li>Added ProRes 4444 (XQ) support for VideoToolbox encoder on macOS [jpark37]</li>
<li>Added lossless audio recording options (FLAC/ALAC/PCM including 32-bit float) [derrod]</li>
<li>Added indicator if an audio source is unmuted, but not assigned to any audio tracks [derrod]</li>
<li>Added support for multiple audio tracks in Simple output recording [pkv]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16797869911680106410gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16797869911680106410gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's various other general improvements and fixes, like these for Linux specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve screen capture performance on Intel dedicated GPUs on Linux [kkartaltepe]</li>
<li>JACK inputs on Linux will now display "OBS Studio" in their name to clarify their origin. This may cause existing configured devices to stop working until updated by the user [univrsal]</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on shutdown with virtual camera on Linux [kkartaltepe/norihiro]</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the V4L2 source on Linux where a capture device's frame rate could be invalid, resulting in incredibly large log files [9p4]</li>
</ul>

      <title>Short underwater survival game FarSky now free on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After closing up shop back in 2022, Farsky Interactive have now revived their game FarSky and made it free on itch.io.</p>
<p>With FarSky, you take the role of Nathan who got lost in the Ocean after the crash of his submarine. You need to learn how to survive in the depths of the Ocean. Your end goal is to gather up all the pieces of your submarine, to fix it and finally reach the surface.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NzG9YqUaMCE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/10a567cefc3253f2267d4b16e6968048.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NzG9YqUaMCE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use the environment to gather resources.</li>
<li>Build a base to refill your oxygen and manage your items.</li>
<li>Craft equipment and weapons to explore and protect yourself in the Ocean depths.</li>
<li>Create an in-base farm or go fish hunting to feed yourself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It might seem like a smaller version of Subnautica and in a way it is. So much so in fact, that the developer of FarSky publicly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/286340/announcements/detail/3087787366398826689" target="_blank">called out</a> developers of Unknown Worlds Entertainment for pretty much poaching the entire idea, here's an excerpt:</p>
<p>"In January 2014, as I was looking for underwater inspiration visuals, I found an image on google that caught my attention. I clicked on it and was redirected to a game page called… « Subnautica ». My first reaction was to think « damn, I made a game way too closed to another one without knowing about it ». Then I realized the game was not even in development yet, there were only some concept arts and ideas. When I saw the name of the project director, I knew I saw this name somewhere … I went on my Twitter account and discovered he was following me as well as his coworkers. At that time, I was devastated. My game was not even out yet, maybe I showed it too early ? I did not expect that, and I knew I could not compete a bigger company like this one. I also found the Subnautica’s director email in the buyers of the game in Beta stage. I felt I needed to quickly finish the game. As I published the Steam Greenlight trailer on Youtube (you needed to put the game on Greenlight before it gets on Steam at that moment), Subnautica project’s leader put a comment with a link to his website. I removed that comment."</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://farsky-interactive.itch.io/farsky" target="_blank">free on itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us on Steam Deck is not great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we are, another big release on Steam and sadly it's just seemingly not a good experience from my early testing. Even though it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-last-of-us-part-i-on-steam-deck-gets-support-from-valve-and-naughty-dog-co-president/" target="_blank">seemed like</a> we might see good support, the result is nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Starting with the big nuisance: even though you've just downloaded it, you won't be ready to play. It will take around an hour to build the shaders on the main menu, something you'll need to do, otherwise you're likely to see worse performance. In my testing, you definitely want to wait on that being done too. Before it was done the performance was far more erratic and it ended up slowing down to a 1FPS crawl during one attempt.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it has the same issue some other bigger games have where the RAM will fill up to around 14/14.1GB as noted on the Steam Deck's performance HUD and then crash completely, often taking the Steam Deck with it for a full reboot.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Zlbl9sGRss"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71cd9332c2414d67c7e761672d2573f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Zlbl9sGRss" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Valve did give it a special Proton <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888930/history/?changeid=18233564" target="_blank">Hotfix</a>, which doesn't seem to have done enough to make it properly playable or be something I can recommend at this time.</p>
<p>As for how it runs on desktop Linux? On my Ryzen 7 5800X and NVIDIA 2080 Ti (Fedora KDE), it gives an out of date driver warning that can be ignored to begin with. Then it took a good 30 minutes (almost to the dot) to do the shaders even with this clearly much more powerful system. When you only have a 2 hour refund window on Steam, that's not good. Now think about people who do genuinely swap between PC and Steam Deck, practically the entire refund window gone to see if you have issues with it.</p>
<p>For desktop though, you can of course get much better performance and at least on the Linux side, it actually seems to run reasonably well even at 2560x1440 with FSR set to Balanced it can mostly stick around 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4350159611680033048gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4350159611680033048gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14808559401680033049gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14808559401680033049gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Both shots were actually 60FPS, but Plasma screenshot spikes the FPS down.</em></p>
<p>Seems it's quite a problematic port overall, as the Steam user reviews instantly went down to Mixed (Edit: and now "Mostly Negative"), with many people on Windows reporting problematic performance and constant crashes.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD RADV driver will soon stop eating RAM with some games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz has continued blogging about Linux graphics driver improvements, with a fix from developer Samuel Pitoiset landing to stop the AMD RADV (Vulkan) driver eating up RAM.</p>
<p>In a blog titled "<a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/oom/" target="_blank">Oom</a>", Blumenkrantz mentioned how it was discovered that Dota 2 was using far too much RAM. Using massif-visualizer and GFXReconstruct, they noticed how Dota 2 was eating up 3GB of RAM "just from the driver" and "nearly all of it just from in-memory shader IR". Turns out this was caused in part by using the new Graphics Pipeline Library, ongoing work to make games smoother using the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension.</p>
<p>Thanks to the effort, the issue was properly identified and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22143" target="_blank">a fix</a> for the problem resulted in an "85% reduction in memory utilization" in Dota 2 that was being tested.</p>
<p>Since this could have potentially hit other games too, and with Graphics Pipeline Library hopefully going to be enabled by default in the next major release of the Mesa drivers, it's good to see.</p>

      <title>Dolphin Emulator for GameCube and Wii is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving you another easy way to download and keep it up to date, the Dolphin Emulator for GameCube and Wii is coming to Steam. Even though it's going to be on Steam, they don't dare mention Nintendo directly on the Steam page: "Dolphin is an emulator for the big N's 6th and 7th generation consoles, featuring enhancements such as increased resolution, save states, and netplay."</p>
<p>In their official <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/03/28/coming-soon-dolphin-steam/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they said to expect a feature article going over the features of the Steam release later, as this has been a "product of many months of work". This will make getting it on Steam Deck easier than ever, and they've even <a href="https://twitter.com/Dolphin_Emu/status/1640589915082887168" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it will support Cloud Saves too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15068793831679993069gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15068793831679993069gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Naturally, the Steam release is just the emulator, you will still need to have your own copy of games to run in it.</p>
<p>They haven't given an exact date, other than the plan is to have it in Early Access on Steam by the end of 2023. They're going with Early Access as some Steam specific features aren't finished yet, plus they want to gather feedback on what people want from the Steam release.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941680/Dolphin_Emulator/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roguelite dungeon crawler Netherguild arrives on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now available in Early Access, if you're looking for a roguelite dungeon crawler take a look at Netherguild.</p>
<p>From solo developer David Vinokurov, Netherguild is a turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawler where you play as the leader of the Netherguild - controlling your little voxel fighters in expeditions below the earth in a desperate attempt to find a cure to a strange plague. Explore, camp, and fight as far as you can before heading back to resupply.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned Early Access will continue for a couple of years, as they continue to add new content and polish the experience with community feedback. New trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sn75aKmif1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/507a358d993150406bf9b3171dbbb22e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sn75aKmif1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Based Combat</strong>: With no attack RNG, so you can count on your units and know when to engage enemies and when to fall back.</li>
<li><strong>Bonfires:</strong> and a food system which affects your characters with passive effects throughout their expedition.</li>
<li><strong>Oddities:</strong> random events you discover which present choices underground.</li>
<li><strong>Replay Value: </strong>with random equipment, random character backgrounds with different skills each playthrough and procedurally generated levels every time you descend underground mean that playthroughs feel different every time.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelite with Persistence and Story:</strong> Keep your characters at the end of each expedition (if they survive), equip them with powerful items and level them up over time. Netherguild's story progresses the more you explore and find out about the secrets of its world.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling Resource Management:</strong> Balance powerful abilities across long expeditions underground.</li>
<li><strong>Original Game World:</strong> Netherguild is unconventional low-fantasy; No Orcs, no Elves, and no wizards casting fireballs. Expect to find strange creatures, machines and denizens far underground.</li>
<li><strong>Cute Voxel Aesthetics:</strong> Contrasted by a story with serious themes, as you face against plague and conspiracy!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll have some proper thoughts up on it when I've had a chance to play plenty of it. I was already impressed with the early demos some time ago and it played well even then.</p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead 3 appears in Counter-Strike 2 files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The internet is currently buzzing about mentions of Left 4 Dead 3 appearing in files for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/counter-strike-2-from-valve-releasing-summer-2023/" target="_blank">upcoming Counter-Strike 2</a>. So apparently Valve can count to 3 — not the 3 the majority of their fans will want I imagine but still, why is it there at all in a huge upgrade for CS:GO?</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/11zghe4/left_4_dead_3_spotted_in_cs2_files/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post, it shows up with some curious strings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6494299221679917553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6494299221679917553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This has led some other news sites to run headlines like "Left 4 Dead 3 is a non-priority", because it makes for a great bit of clickbait, even though it also says the severity is "high". Realistically, no one outside of Valve will even know what these strings are actually doing.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead 2 is easily one of my absolute favourites from Valve, so I'm cautiously excited over this. Clearly Valve are slowly getting back into actual games. We had the fantastic (and one of my all-time favourite experiences) with Half-Life: Alyx, Counter-Strike 2 coming this Summer and then who knows what? Valve hit a home-run with the Steam Deck as well, and clearly what has been announced for Counter-Strike 2 has a lot of people excited so it would be good to see them keep up this momentum.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Might we get a Left 4 Dead 3 announcement at some point?</em></p>

      <title>Halls of Torment is classic Diablo meets Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, going to say goodbye to any free time I had for the next month. Halls of Torment has sucked me right in being a blend of retro Diablo and Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I'm pretty sure I scrolled away from this on Steam the first time it came up, thinking it didn't look like much. Until the developer prodded me on Twitter, so I decided I might as well. Checking it out was a bad idea because I'm now going to be spending every spare moment playing the free Prelude until the main game enters Early Access later this year.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GCVIaeK504g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e30f4e84ece6af502265aab138b63ab5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GCVIaeK504g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm already a big fan of these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a> / Vampire Survivors-likes, and so far most of them have given something unique that they all become worth playing. Here, it isn't just the retro pre-rendered Diablo-like style that it has going for it, although it is pretty nice for fans of the classic.</p>
<p>You do run around auto-attacking, picking up gems and levelling up like the others but here a level up is just a stat boost. To get new abilities, you need to actually explore the map and pick up pages. On top of that, you also pick up equipment much more like a traditional ARPG. Together, it has very nicely blended two similar genres but with the now very well known theme from Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17947119051679916230gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17947119051679916230gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18376219661679916227gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18376219661679916227gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Content included in the free Prelude:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 stages with dynamic progression.</li>
<li>3+ unique bosses.</li>
<li>15+ unique monsters.</li>
<li>3+ playable characters.</li>
<li>6+ different and upgradable abilities.</li>
<li>8+ blessings making you stronger for each attempt.</li>
<li>30+ different items to unlock and retrieve.</li>
<li>100+ traits that upgrade characters and abilities.</li>
<li>30+ quests to complete.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The boss battles are impressive too, I will admit my real surprise here facing the first big demon that appeared with it using a blend of attacks against me, caught me a bit off-guard after mowing-down a ton of skeletons.</p>

      <title>AMD detail more on FSR 3 and their new open source FidelityFX SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD had plenty to show off at GDC, and they've done a bit of a summary and some of it is quite exciting for future games.</p>
<p>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is open source and they will be sticking to that with the MIT license, with FSR 3 getting some more early details but they said it's still too early to show a lot of it. As explained in their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/gdc-2023-fidelityfx-sdk-fsr3/" target="_blank">GPUOpen</a> post they're introducing "interpolated frames" which has allow them to get a "2x framerate boost". It's more complex though with some challenges:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We can’t rely on color clamping to correct the color of outdated samples.</li>
<li>Non-linear motion interpolation is hard with 2D screen space motion vectors, which is why we recommend at least 60fps input.</li>
<li>If the final frames are interpolated, then the UI and all post-processing will also need to interpolated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is good news!</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a high probability there will be at least one sample for every interpolated pixel.</li>
<li>There’s no feedback loop as the interpolated frame will only be shown once – any interpolation artifact would only remain for one frame.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19997125221679670271gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19997125221679670271gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With FSR 3 you're going to get better framerates at the cost of latency. However, they said they will be including "latency reduction techniques to FSR 3". AMD also said it should be easier to integrate FSR 3 if developers already support FSR 2.</p>
<p>Additionally they've announced the FidelityFX SDK, also open source, which combines together their multiple effects libraries giving developers an easier way to integrate it. As previously their stuff has all been spread-out, causing problems for developers with "inconsistencies in coding and documentation standards, limited platform/API support" and so this SDK is their attempt to to "do better".</p>
