      <title>29 games are getting delisted from GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

</ul>
<p><em>Two of those are bundles of the other games. The article originally said it was 31 in total so updated to correct.</em></p>
<p>For all of those GOG simply said "I can't share any more details about it". That's a pretty abrupt delisting too for the Meridian4 titles, giving only a couple of days notice.</p>
<p>If you've been on the fence about wanting to pick up any of those from GOG, now is the time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>PSA: If our GOG links don't open - blame your plugins. Some browser plugins at some point decided to just auto-close certain affiliate links, the same links we've used for a long time now. They used to give a message asking if you wish to proceed, now some just…don't. You should report the issue to the developer of whatever plugins you're using.</p>

      <title>Valve heads to PAX Australia for the first time, maybe they&#39;ll finally get the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAX Aus have announced their 2024 line-up and it's absolutely packed with big names. Curiously, even Valve for Steam will be attending.</p>
<p>The line-up of exhibitors was <a href="https://aus.paxsite.com/en-us/info/news/2024-exhibitor-line-up.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> yesterday, September 17th, in an official post on the PAX Aus website. It notes that some big brands and companies will be there including Bethesda Softworks ANZ, Blizzard Entertainment, Devolver, FINAL FANTASY XIV Online, PC Game Pass, Playside Studios, SEGA, Steam, The Sims, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Quite exciting to see Steam listed with the event organisers noting "While on the topic of love, PAX Aus welcomes Steam for the first time ever. More on that when the show opens, you’re not going to want to miss it!"</p>
<p>Sounds interesting and they're clearly being a little coy. Pointing perhaps to something exciting coming, and a gaming event would be a good place to announce anything for a company like Valve.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, Australia might <em>finally</em> see a proper Steam Deck release? Even though it's not officially available, that hasn't stopped plenty of stores in Australia letting people buy it via importing it which many people have done so. However, getting it done officially would be awesome for the continued success of Valve's hardware.</p>
<p>Although, it might not be Steam Deck related, who knows, they might even use the time for an official Deadlock launch into a more open Beta without needing invites. Time to keep expectations in check huh?</p>
<p>The event runs from October 11th - 13th October, 2024.</p>

      <title>Frame of Mind developer ended up coding the game on Steam Deck for a year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one for you. What do you do when you're a game developer and your laptop dies? Use your Steam Deck to continue developing of course.</p>
<p>While the Steam Deck is a great device for gaming, it's also a full Linux-powered PC too, with a complete desktop mode powered by KDE Plasma. This means it can be used for both work and play, and it's always fun to see how people are using it.</p>
<p>In the case of the upcoming game Frame of Mind - A game of thoughts. (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2515480/Frame_of_Mind__A_game_of_thoughts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>), the developer ended up actually doing a years worth of work on the game using the Steam Deck. As they said in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2515480/announcements/detail/6978979436063296992" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> post on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Spring, I was very excited as I finally got my SteamDeck in the mail. The big day came aaaand ... my Laptop died.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the Steam Deck unironically became my main mobile workstation for about a year, and while I admittedly would not go back to it, it was a lot more usable than you might suspect.<br/>
<br/>
This is why i am also proud to announce: My Game will have FULL Steam Deck Support.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, without much optimization, the game is already running well above the 40FPS target for running games smoothly at the lower display refresh rate and I am pretty sure I will be able to hit the 60FPS mark, hopefully even without any 3D render scaling. But as this is a cozy walking sim, you will likely not notice small stutters anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The game furthermore has full controller support and plays a lot better on the Steam Deck, as especially the touch screen will get a lot of utilization.<br/>
<br/>
Font rendering is being considered, as my game has a lot of text and I put a lot of emphasis on accessibility. This is an area that right now needs more development.<br/>
<br/>
I will also look into using the joypads and the accelerator for input, but do not want to promise anything right now.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised they <em>don't</em> wish to go back to using the Steam Deck like this though, unless you have a proper dock setup or something like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-elecrow-crowview-note-is-a-real-useful-all-in-one-portable-monitor-and-keyboard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Elecrow CrowView Note</a>, the small screen space isn't great for work. But it just shows how versatile the system is.</p>
<p>The game is made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, which has some of the best Linux support available of any game engine.</p>

      <title>Dead by Daylight spin-off Project T has been cancelled, Midwinter Entertainment shut down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Midwinter Entertainment and Behaviour Interactive Inc. were working on Project T, a spin-off from the popular Dead by Daylight but it's now been shelved.</p>
<p>Set in the DBD universe the developers originally described it as: "Project T is a 1–4-person co-op PVE shooter currently in early development. Load your shotgun, ready your truck, and team up to traverse a haunting and dangerous world, facing waves of enemies from the darkest corners of The Entity’s Realm."</p>
<p>However, a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2424380/view/7124220524042684644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> was posted on the Steam page, and the description on the page also removed to mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To our Community,</p>
<p>When we conceptualized this project, we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which led to the creation of this Insiders Program. This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on Project T’s core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game. Following the playtest in July, we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from both a product and commercial perspective. While a number of you expressed appreciation for what you played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results.</p>
<p>It’s with a heavy heart that we announce that Project T has been canceled. We want to thank you for your support throughout this journey.</p>
<p>-The Project T Team</p>

<p>According to people who worked at Midwinter Entertainment, the studio has also been shut down as a result as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by Daniel Alexander, who was Animation &amp; Art Lead at Midwinter Entertainment.

      <title>Wildkeepers Rising is Vampire Survivors merged with Pokemon and I need it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing together two of my favourites genres. Monster catching and survivor-like bullet heaven, Wildkeepers Rising seems like it's going to be awesome. I thought that the idea of Temtem: Swarm sounded good, but Wildkeepers Rising appears to push the idea much further into a bigger game (and with a vastly different style).</p>
<p>Announced today from Lioncode Games who also made Mech Armada released back in 2022.</p>
<p>Wildkeepers Rising will give you the ridiculous over-the-top and ever-increasing power from the survivor-like boom, while also giving you a creature collection of friends to join you in combat. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7NqUf9zQyjU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d4936bef6c34c93abace2ddc1db4237.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7NqUf9zQyjU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet Heaven </strong>| Shred thousands of monsters in bullet heaven runs</li>
<li><strong>Creature Collector</strong> | Discover, tame, and train magical beasts</li>
<li><strong>Runs &amp; Builds</strong> | Create team synergies with different Guardians</li>
<li><strong>Roguelike Runs</strong> | Take runs with different Wildkeepers wielding different weapons</li>
<li><strong>Progression</strong> | Unlock new Guardians and items and make them stronger between runs</li>
<li><strong>RPG Elements</strong> | Discover a rich world of fantasy heroes and magical monsters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’ve seen survivor games adopt some twists since the original recipe<em>, </em>integrating mining, guns, and god boons; <strong><em>Wildkeepers</em></strong><em> </em>further innovates by adding adorable creature collecting and party synergy to the dopamine rush and replayability of games like <em>Vampire Survivors </em>or<em> Death Must Die” </em>– Sergio Garces, Lioncode Games Director.</p>
<p>“I’m combining cues and inspiration from my favorite anime and fantasy titles to make these monsters as fun and whimsical as I can. Classic arcade beat-em-ups are hugely influential on our character roster as well–we’re a small team, so we’re working hard to create a love letter to our influences that inspired us to want to create.” – Lyle Moore, Art Director.</p>

      <title>Grand Theft Auto V gets BattlEye anti-cheat, breaks online play on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update #1 - 14:31 UTC</strong>: Rockstar have now put up an official <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for BattlEye where they state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is BattlEye compatible with Steam Deck?</p>
<p>Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for GTA Online. You will be able to play GTAV Story Mode but unable to play GTA Online.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GTAV and GTA Online are not officially supported on Steam Deck and all technical support questions should be directed to Valve’s Steam Deck support content and community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still currently waiting for an official statement from Rockstar on any plans to enable it, since BattlEye as mentioned below <em>is</em> supported on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 - 18/09/24, 9:30 UTC</strong>: Rockstar press did not reply, but their support team did. They simply copied the new FAQ entry noted above, and when pushed just told me to use their feedback form and closed up my ticket asking about it. Typical support-level reply.</p>
<p>I've emailed Valve press to see if they have anything they would like to say on the situation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, Rockstar have now added BattlEye anti-cheat to Grand Theft Auto V / GTA Online, and sadly it seems they have not enabled the support for Linux desktop and Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. <em>The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable.</em></p>
<p>When you try to play online, you might stay in for a minute or so but then abruptly you get this and you're kicked:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12685204351726575009gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12685204351726575009gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - my test of GTA V Online on Kubuntu 24.04</em></p>
<p>Hopefully this is just an oversight, since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/battleye-confirms-linux-support-for-steam-deck-will-be-opt-in-like-easy-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye does have Linux platform support</a>. I've reached out to Rockstar in a few places to ask about it, to see if they do plan to enable Proton support for BattlEye.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn't <em>intentionally</em> blocked, let's say they overlooked enabling it, this once again just goes to show that the Steam Deck and Linux gaming have ways to go before bigger developers and publishers actually do some proper testing.</p>
<p>Considering it's one of the most played games on Steam overall, it will be quite a loss if it's intentionally not being enabled. It's also one of the most played games on Steam Deck specifically too, so it would make this banner on the Steam page look a bit silly if it stays broken:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025322641726576091gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The single-player story mode continues to work though.</p>

      <title>Fuse creatures together in NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters - set for launch on September 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing together auto-battling and monster-training into a fun mixture, NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters from DiceHit Games and Rogue Duck Interactive releases on September 30th. It has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Very similar to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/backpack-battles-is-another-clear-indie-steam-hit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Battles</a>, but the monster twist to it seemed interesting from the previous demo I played through for quite a while. Here you have the inventory management side to it but you also have the Cosmions, little monsters you put in your bag that you evolve and fuse to create unique builds to fight with.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xf1LR2mEvhw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0746e8e4147a787e0a4aa2402f1aef20.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xf1LR2mEvhw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters is our ode to the strategy and auto-battling genre. We wanted to create a game where players could experiment with builds, create unique combinations, and play on their own time. The Cosmions add a layer of depth, allowing for a plethora of possibilities in every duel." ​- Bahadır, lead developer at DiceHit Games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Your Dream Team</strong>: Select and place your Cosmions to create powerful synergies and defeat your opponents. After each Duel, choose new Cosmions to enhance your team and aim for the win.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Duelists at Your Own Pace</strong>: Enjoy asynchronous multiplayer gameplay, allowing you to control the pace of the game. Pause and resume at your convenience, with your progress saved and opponents ready for your next move. </li>
<li><strong>Evolve and Fuse Your Cosmions</strong>: Use essences to evolve your Cosmions into their most advanced forms and fuse different monsters to unlock unique and powerful creations.</li>
<li><strong>Climb the Competitive Ranks</strong>: Boost your Elo-ranking by competing against other players and aim for the top in a thrilling, competitive setting.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Different Builds</strong>: Customize your gameplay with unique modifications and upgrades that showcase your style. Explore various tactics and uncover powerful synergies to maximize your backpack’s potential.</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693940/NEODUEL_Backpack_Monsters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dark fantasy FPS fans should check out Hands of Necromancy II</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Following on from the positively rated Hands of Necromancy, HON Team and Fulqrum Publishing are back bringing you more Heretic and Doom styled fun in Hands of Necromancy II. Available with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Looks like a lot of fun for retro-FPS fans, with some truly silly weapons and spells to use like a tornado to launch enemies into the air which was a fan favourite from the first game. Plus plenty new in this sequel like a grenade that splits into many smaller grenades to give a big area-of-effect boom. You sure are eating good if you're a fan of games inspired by the classics.</p>

<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as the brash, boastful Necromancer from the original game, or select the new, wiser female character with a completely different set of weapons and spells</li>
<li>Transform into powerful, monstrous forms with unique abilities, with each character having access to different transformations</li>
<li>Raise your fallen foes as undead servants to aid you in battle, using an improved necromancy system</li>
<li>Interact with the environment, including flammable trees, exploding barrels, breakable vases and windows, and watch out for new deadly traps</li>
<li>Explore 24 sprawling levels in 3 distinct chapters of the story</li>
<li>Obliterate 26 different enemy types and conquer 4 formidable bosses in epic showdowns</li>
</ul>

      <title>LibreQuake aims to create a completely free Quake alternative compatible with mods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a similar spirit to <a href="https://freedoom.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freedoom</a>, for Quake fans perhaps you'll want to take a look at LibreQuake, which aims to do a similar thing.</p>
<p>As they explain best on the <a href="https://github.com/lavenderdotpet/LibreQuake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>LibreQuake</em> project aims to create a complete, free content first-person shooter game, but <em>LibreQuake</em> by itself is just the raw material for a game. It must be paired with a compatible engine to be played.</p>
<p>There is a massive <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back catalogue</a>, spanning over two decades, containing thousands of <em>Quake</em> levels and other modifications (“mods”) made by fans of the game. <em>LibreQuake</em> aims to be compatible with these and allows most to be played without the need to use non-free software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So with LibreQuake, you will be able to play through a bunch of classic Quake content without needing to mess around with the original proprietary Quake content itself. At least that seems to be the plan. You would pair this up with your favourite open source Quake game engine like Quakespasm, Quakespasm-Spiked, vkQuake or whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/340052131726566222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/340052131726566222gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - LibreQuake, credit: LibreQuake team.</em></p>
<p>It's not just about allowing you to play through Quake mods and conversions freely, it's also great for the modders too. They can base their mods on this, instead of the proprietary content from Quake, and have no issues with licensing then and no chance in future of mods being taken down if they're using free software. As the LibreQuake team say: "Most Quake projects are lax on reusing intellectual property".</p>

      <title>Real-time air-traffic management sim &#39;Mini Airways&#39; gets Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mini Airways is a total delight and now it's even better with some extra free maps, plus there's also now Steam Workshop support with a level editor. See also: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/real-time-air-traffic-controller-sim-mini-airways-is-out-now-and-will-keep-you-on-your-toes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my previous thoughts on the game</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? As a reminder: Mini Airways is a real-time management game with an air traffic control theme. You will play as a busy air traffic controller in the game: directing planes to take off and land, clearing air traffic, upgrading airspace ...... And most of all, don't let them crash!</p>
<p>Thanks to the level editor there's already (at time of writing) over 170 maps approved in the Steam Workshop. So once you've finished the main game, perhaps try out some of them?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15503318071726565546gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15503318071726565546gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Plenty more new with this free update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two Unique New Maps:
<ul>
<li>Cheongju Airport, South Korea: Featuring a runway reserved only for emergency landings.</li>
<li>Hamad International Airport, Qatar: Expect occasional extreme weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triple Speed Button: <span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px"> Speed up the early game for quicker progress.</span></li>
<li>Pre-Flight Turning Commands: <span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">You can now issue turn commands to planes on the runway, which will execute after takeoff.</span></li>
<li>Enhanced Collision Alerts (TCAS): <span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px"> Improved visibility for imminent collision warnings.</span></li>
<li>Optional Voice Settings: Customize your experience by turning certain voice prompts on or off.</li>

      <title>Enlisted from Darkflow / Gaijin swapping from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Darkflow Software and Gaijin Network Ltd have announced their multiplayer online shooter Enlisted will be changing the anti-cheat sometime in the coming days.</p>
<p>Announced in a post on Steam, no particular reason was given on <em>why</em> they're dropping Easy Anti-Cheat and going with BattlEye instead. They're two of the most popular anti-cheat systems with game developers with BattlEye being used in games like DayZ, ARK Survival Evolved, Conan Exiles, Fortnite (that also uses EAC too), The Crew 2, Tarkov, Destiny 2 and so on.</p>
<p>What they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2051620/announcements/detail/4594323246560579728?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commanders, in the coming days Enlisted will transition to a new anti-cheat software, BattlEye. With its help, we'll be able to combat forbidden modifications even more effectively!</p>
<p>For honest players, nothing will change, just our old anti-cheat software will simply be replaced by BattlEye!</p>
<p>Advantages of the new anti-cheat</p>
<p>BattlEye already protects dozens of different multiplayer shooters. It will be very useful in Enlisted too! It effectively fights against unfair play, working on both server and client side, constantly checking for interference in the game processes. Thus, most hacks are completely blocked from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Everything will happen automatically!</p>
<p>Replacing the protection system will take a little time and will occur during one of the launches of the Enlisted client. Afterwards, you'll be greeted by a new protection system window at the start of the game.</p>
<p>BattlEye will only work while the Enlisted client is running and will not affect your system's performance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6653538391726493800gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Enlisted has a Native Linux version and is rated Steam Deck Playable, with the verification by Valve done using their Native Linux version too. So with that in mind, it should be fine, especially since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/battleye-confirms-linux-support-for-steam-deck-will-be-opt-in-like-easy-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye does have Linux support</a>. However, as with any anti-cheat change, some issues may pop up which hopefully they will fix soon if there are any.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enlisted on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Verified - your game highlights for mid-September 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking to pick up some more games for Steam Deck or Desktop Linux? Well, here's a whole bunch more that should work great. All the games listed here are <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified, which going by Valve's testing means they <em>should</em> just be click-and-play without any fussing around.</p>
<p>In case you missed it we hit <a href="http://Steam Deck reaches over 16,000 playable and verified games" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 games Verified + Playable back in August</a>.

      <title>The TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3 is a big powerful desktop-replacement class laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who have the need for something somewhat portable, with a lot of power, perhaps the TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3 will be your next purchase. TUXEDO are saying this is a desktop replacement workstation, so if you're looking for something small and light this definitely isn't it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/267810411726490164gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/267810411726490164gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The base configuration of the units comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen: WQHD (2560 x 1440) IPS matt | 240 Hz | 99% sRGB.</li>
<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX (16 Cores | 32 Threads | Max Boost 5.4 GHz | 85 W TDP).</li>
<li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 8GB.</li>
<li>RAM: 16 GB (2x 8GB) DDR5 5600MHz Crucial.</li>
<li>Storage: 500 GB Samsung 980 (NVMe PCIe 3.0).</li>
<li>Keyboard: Backlit with TUX super-key.</li>
<li>Connectivity: Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210 (802.11ax | 2.4, 5 &amp; 6 GHz | Bluetooth 5.3).</li>
<li>Battery: 73 Wh battery.</li>
<li>Operating System: TUXEDO OS, Ubuntu or Kubuntu (Windows 11 costs extra).</li>
<li>2 years warranty (Incl. parts, labour &amp; shipping)</li>
</ul>
<p>A slightly eye-watering price at 1699 EUR (includes tax if you're in Germany) and 1427 EUR for customers outside Europe (excluding tax). You can configure it higher too with up to 64GB RAM, NVIDIA 4070 and up to 2 x 4TB storage.</p>
<p>Plenty of ports including USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (5 Gbit/s), 2-in-1 audio jack (mic-in, headphone-out), USB-A 3.2 Gen2 (10 Gbit/s), USB-C 3.2 Gen2 (Hardwired to: iGPU | NO DisplayPort 1.4a | PowerDelivery DC-In | DC-Out: max. 15 Watt (5 V / 3 A)), Mini DisplayPort 1.4 (Hardwired to: dGPU | G-SYNC compatible), RJ45 1 Gbit LAN, HDMI 2.1 (Hardwired to: dGPU | G-SYNC | HDCP 2.3), Power plug (DC-In) and USB-C 3.2 Gen2 (Hardwired to: iGPU | DisplayPort 1.4a | <u>NO</u> PowerDelivery DC-In | DC-Out: max. 15 Watt (5 V / 3 A)).</p>
<p>I've no doubt some will think "what's the point, it's huge, buy a desktop!", but carrying around a monitor and tower aren't exactly realistic. For people who <em>need</em> the power <em>and</em> the portability of throwing it in a suitable bag, it's useful and with those high specs, it will last quite a long time to come.</p>
<p>Shipping for it begins mid-October.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 1 emulator DuckStation changes license for no commercial use and no derivatives</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a bit of a furore in the emulation community lately centred around the PlayStation 1 emulator <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DuckStation</a>, which has now seen two license changes recently. As far as I'm aware, DuckStation is the most popular emulator for Sony's classic PS1 console, due to it being fast and accurate.</p>
<p>Up until recently it was open source under the GPL, then on <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/commit/9ca6b5430fb358b39f21ce0b2fc0268de954dd23" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 1st</a> it changed over to the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/strict/1.0.0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PolyForm Strict License</a>, and then again on <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/commit/76906756d0b5f93ac2559c29676cbea11496a21a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 13th</a> it was changed over to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CC-BY-NC-ND license</a>. This places a number of restrictions on the project like no commercial use and no derivatives allowed. That means, according to the creator, that no one else is allowed to package it up either as their change mentioned "Packaging is still **not** permitted, since it is effectively a modified/derived work".</p>
<p>Replying to a user unhappy about it on the GitHub, the creator <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/pull/3295#issuecomment-2348988362" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am well aware of how licenses work. That's why I changed, to make it very clear and a deterrent due to certain parties violating the old license, by not attributing and stripping my copyright. Packagers being collateral damage was a beneficial side-effect, considering they don't clearly mark their versions as modified (also a GPL requirement), break functionality, and expect upstream to provide support.</p>
<p>I have the approval of prior contributors, and if I did somehow miss you, then please advise me so I can rewrite that code. I didn't spend several weekends rewriting various parts for no reason. I do not have, nor want a CLA, because I do not agree with taking away contributor's copyright.</p>
<p>Also, I don't appreciate the threats. If you are not a copyright holder, then you <strong>are not in a position to make any demands.</strong> I find it especially ironic, considering when the GPL was actually violated on multiple occasions, even as recently as a few months ago, nobody ever takes issue with that.</p>
<p>I've restricted the repository to prior contributors, and if they have any concerns, they are more than welcome to do so here. If this turns into harassment, then I'll just shut the whole thing down, because I'm way too busy with my actual job to be dealing with unsubstantiated drama from a hobby that is supposed to be fun. Please consider how the community would benefit from that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, this means DuckStation as of the latest changes is no longer open source. You could say it's "source available", or <em>whatever</em> your chosen way is to describe code you can view but has restrictions on it.</p>

      <title>Valve make even more changes for Steam store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are continuing to tweak how Steam store pages are displayed, along with giving developers more tools to show exactly what they want.</p>
<p>This all started from Valve attempting to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deal with the publisher spam problem</a>. Where certain publishers would dump game after game in a list on some of their store pages, before you even got to the description of what the game actually is you're currently viewing. Basically they were using some store pages as an advert for another game. It became a real nuisance and Valve banned it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-tweak-steam-pages-again-giving-developers-some-more-options-while-dealing-with-the-mess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">More tweaks came in late August </a>giving developers extra control over the "more from" and DLC lists, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4592070813172257798" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this latest update</a> adds in additional options along with delaying all the new rules until October 15th to give developers more time to adjust store pages.</p>
<p>The first new feature is bundle pinning, so developers can put bundles on store pages in whatever order they actually want. By default though, Valve has said the order is based on "recent revenue generated by purchases of that bundle" as they see it as a reasonable default. Since games can be in any number of bundles, only 3 are displayed, so this way developers can pin what they want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1735218791726484998gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve also expanded what social media links are allowed in the sidebar on store pages to include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>QQ</li>
<li>VK (VKontakte)</li>
<li>Bilibili</li>
<li>Weibo</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Baidu Tieba</li>
<li>Tiktok</li>
<li>Telegram</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We're all confused (including Valve) on why LinkedIn is in the list, but developers are using it.</em></p>
<p>Another change is to the "more from" list at the bottom of store pages. Now developers can choose to include games from <em>any</em> entities listed as a developer or publisher for a game (as there can be multiple in both). On top of that, the more than section can now have a special item pinned bigger to the front of the list taking up the space of two items and have buttons for add to cart / wishlist.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4936514791726484731gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Lastly, there's some tweaks to the DLC list too so developers can list DLC dependencies, where one DLC needs to be owned for another, which according to Valve doesn't happen all that much but purchasers of course need to know this. Developers can also now re-order the DLC list a little easier.</p>

      <title>An interview with the creator of Lutris</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to learn a little more about <a href="https://lutris.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lutris</a>, the popular Linux app for managing games, emulators and much more? Here's your chance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> like with the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/an-interview-with-the-developers-of-the-heroic-games-launcher/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher interview</a> this was originally posted on Reddit, with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flwwhtrbt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">user</a> sending it over to GamingOnLinux for republishing. We're just providing a space here for more people to see it and learn more. Also, if you didn't see recently, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-creator-of-lutris-has-joined-up-with-playtron-for-playtronos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">creator of Lutris recently joined Playtron</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the interview:</p>
<h4>Introduction and Background</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q1: Can you tell us a bit about yourself, Lutris and how it got started? I see that you initially made Oblivion Launcher, so this has clearly been your passion for a long time. What sparked you to jump from that to Lutris?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathieu Comandon</strong>: "I had recently switched to Linux as my main OS, after using it on secondary machines for a while. I still wanted to play my games but at the time, it meant reading tutorials that would get outdated really fast or only worked on one distro. Getting games to run on Linux could become a very frustrating experience at times but it seemed that this could be considerably improved."</p>
<h5>Q2: In a more broad sense, what was the inspiration behind creating Lutris?</h5>
<p>"Around that time I was using Cedega, a proprietary fork of Wine with a nice GUI. I wanted something similar but open source but I didn't want to limit myself to Wine games like Cedega or PlayOnLinux did. I wanted support for all games that could run on Linux, which included native games and emulators."</p>
<h5>Q3: Can you give us a brief overview of your team's background and how you came together to develop it?</h5>
<p>"These days, the team is mostly Daniel Johnson, who does an enormous amount of user support on <a href="https://github.com/lutris" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a> and GloriousEggroll who provides builds for Proton-GE. Then there's the Open Wine Components project that encompasses other gaming projects and regular contributors on Github.<br/>
There's also a very active moderation team on the Discord server.<br/>
There's no fixed team structure, anyone can just come and go, do their own thing."</p>
<h5>Q4: How has Lutris itself evolved since its initial release?</h5>
<p>"15 years ago, gaming on Linux was very experimental. With the evolution that happened in the past years, it's now something we have integrated in our lives. Games running on Linux is now the norm. So instead of tinkering, we can shift our focus on making sure games keep running in the years to come, particularly games that are no longer being sold."</p>
<h5>Tell me about your logo for Lutris!</h5>
<p>"The initial logo (the version with the Atari joystick) was designed by a friend of mine at the time and later received some updates to make it more readable at small sizes. It was always meant to take inspiration from Mozilla's logos. A lot of projects have an animal as their logo: PHP, Postgres, Firefox... so I wanted my own animal mascot. I picked the otter because it's an animal that likes to play!"</p>
<h4>Features and Functionality</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q5: What are the key features that set Lutris apart from other game launchers? There is a few now who offer similar capabilities, what makes Lutris so unique?</h5>
<p>"Lutris is the only launcher on Linux to support such a wide array of games from all platforms. Most launchers focus on Wine but Wine is only one of the 54 runners we currently support. The idea is to be able to build a collection of all the games you have played during your lifetime, easily accessible and playable."</p>
<h5>Q6: How does Lutris integrate with Steam, especially on the Steam Deck?</h5>
<p>"The Steam integration is much more basic now than it once was when we used to run Steam in Wine. Running Steam games from Lutris only calls Steam with the correct Steam ID, the options in Lutris don't apply to the Steam game. For the Steam Deck, it's the opposite: Running Lutris games in Steam. We have a feature for creating shortcuts for Lutris games in the Steam UI. In the next release of Lutris, we'll also have better support for running games with umu on the Steam Deck (it makes it possible to use Proton instead of Wine)."</p>
<h5>Q7: Could you explain how Lutris handles the management and optimization of non-native games?</h5>
<p>"We call runner any program that can launch games, native games being the only games that don't require one. We provide binaries for those runners, which get updated on a more or less regular basis. The important is not using the latest version but having a version that can run games really well. For example, we ship DOSBox Staging to provide a better experience for DOS games. Wine / Proton is the only runner that receives some patching."</p>
<h5>Q8: What features do you think are the most underappreciated by users?</h5>
<p>"Certainly the collection management and non Wine games aspects. I often see people with less than 10 games on Lutris and all mostly Wine based. On my end, I have over 1300 installed games for a variety of platforms. Sadly, the fact that people have switched from HDDs to SSDs doesn't help building a large video game collection."</p>
<h4>Development and Community</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q9: How do you prioritize and manage feature requests and bug reports from the community? I see you have such a sizable community built up around you (which speaks volumes to your skills as a programmer), can you describe what goes into prioritizing bugs or features?</h5>
<p>"If something is broken and impacts significantly the usage of Lutris then that gets the highest priority. Then comes the pull requests submitted by contributors. Bugs that can't be reproduced or features that would only interest a small portion of users get the lowest priority."</p>
<h5>Q10: Can you share any interesting stories or challenges you faced during the development of Lutris?</h5>
<p>"Between 2011 and 2012, the development of Lutris had crawled almost to a halt because of a game called Minecraft.<br/>
At numerous times, maintaining the project felt very overwhelming and it was often difficult to deal with that. I often resorted to measures that were more or less clumsy but however gave me some breathing space (for a few months, reporting issues was only allowed to previous contributors, for example). Nowadays, managing the project is much easier. I put less pressure on myself to try and micro-manage everything and I get some precious help from the community to help me with Github."</p>
<h5>Q11: How important has community feedback been in shaping Lutris? Can you give an example of a community-driven feature that you ended up implementing?</h5>
<p>"The community has a tendency to push for the adoption of newer technologies while I have a tendency to hold back a bit before we adopt anything new. Some people use lutris on quite outdated systems and we try not breaking anything until a distribution gets really old. Finding the right balance is quite an art but the community helps in knowing what is needed and which systems can be dropped.</p>
<p>Also, a few runners we have were entirely written by community members. Translations are another aspect that is heavily driven by the community."</p>
<h5>Q12: How do you foster a positive and engaged community around Lutris? Your discord in particular are so positive about your product, how do you encourage your users to participate and contribute </h5>
<p>"I don't have the time to do much on Discord but there is an amazing moderation team. Troublemakers are kicked out really fast which keeps the vibe on the server positive. Personally, I tend to engage more with the community on Github and Mastodon."</p>
<h4>Technical Aspects</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q13: What technologies and programming languages is Lutris built on?</h5>
<p>"The desktop client is using Gtk 3, the website uses Django. Both are written in Python. We also have a moderation dashboard written in VueJS."</p>
<h5>Q14: Can you discuss the challenges and solutions in ensuring compatibility across various Linux distributions?</h5>
<p>"We've been shipping a set of libraries with Lutris trying to increase compatibility across distros. This isn't a perfect solution but works for the most part. This is the approach Steam used to have. Now, similarly to Steam, we are transitioning to a container based approach, whether it's pressure vessel with umu or Flatpak."</p>
<h5>Q15: How do you approach optimizing performance for different hardware configurations, especially for the Steam Deck?</h5>
<p>"We don't really have anything in place that target specific devices. We do however provide many option to let users find the best possible setting for their games."</p>
<h5>Q16: How do you handle the rapid changes and updates, do the Steam Deck's updates ever affect what you do?</h5>
<p>"There are some breakages once in a while but so far the Steam Deck with its immutable OS has been pretty stable. We're still working on providing support for using Proton on the Deck's game mode but it's coming soon."</p>
<h4>Future Plans</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q17: What are your short-term and long-term goals for Lutris?</h5>
<p>"Short term is the release of Lutris 0.5.18. It will contain all the fixes and improvements made during the past few months, but nothing really groundbreaking. In the longer term, we're going to start working on a "Big picture mode" (integration with OpenGamepadUI) and cloud saves."</p>
<h5>Q18: Are there any upcoming features or improvements you’re particularly excited about?</h5>
<p>"The 2 I mentioned earlier, cloud saves and fullscreen UI are very important. We also need a better rating system and better support for Flatpak (by making the Lutris Flatpak very thin and using other Flatpaks to run games)"</p>
<h5>Q19: How do you see Lutris evolving with the advancements in gaming technology and hardware?</h5>
<p>"That mostly depends on upstream projects like Gamescope, VKD3D, Mesa or Plasma. We used to lack a lot of features of newer hardware like HDR or ray tracing. Now, we have pretty much every feature used in games like DLSS, FSR3, HDR, etc... Now, we're only lacking in anti-cheat support."</p>
<h5>Q20: What is your vision for the future of gaming on Linux?</h5>
<p>"Projects like the Steam Deck and Playtron are going to help push gaming on Linux outside of the Linux community and make it available to a wider audience. Maybe we'll finally see game consoles for the TV using Linux. The new trend of handhelds is nice but it's not the best way to experience games with graphics pushed to their highest settings."</p>
<h4>Community and Support</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q21: What are the best ways for users to get involved with the Lutris community?</h5>
<p>"Easiest way is to join the Discord server. That's where most of the non-development stuff happens. We might get a bridged Matrix room at some point too."</p>
<h5>Q22: How can users contribute to the development or support of Lutris?</h5>
<p>"For development, we have a list of open tickets on Github, and if someone wants to implement something new, I recommend creating a ticket if one doesn't exist. Sometimes, some contributors send a patch which doesn't fit the project and we don't merge it. We want to avoid that kind of situation, especially for substantial patches.<br/>
Supporting the project financially is very much appreciated. There are Patreon, Paypal and Liberapay Lutris accounts that can be used for donations. We don't accept cryptocurrency though."</p>
<h5>Q23: What resources do you offer for new users to get started with Lutris?</h5>
<p>"The goal for Lutris is to not require any ressources to get started so if anything is missing or unclear, report it as a bug."</p>
<h5>Q24: How do you address user support and ensure issues are resolved efficiently?</h5>
<p>"In a lot of user support for Lutris means troubleshooting generic Linux issues. That's we have both a Lutris Support and Linux Support channels in our Discord server. Usually, when something is broken in Lutris, we'll start getting multiple reports for it and we prioritize those issues first."</p>
<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
<hr/>
<h5>Q25: What advice would you give to aspiring developers who want to create their own game launchers or similar tools?</h5>
<p>"Build a very small project that solves a real and specific issue you have and try to make it work. If it solves your problem, it may continue evolving into something bigger."</p>
<h5>Q26: Is there anything else you’d like to share with our readers about Lutris or your team?</h5>
<p>"When I started working on Lutris, I had no idea it would reach this size. I initially imagined it would mostly be picked up by the community and I would focus on other project. But then Linux gaming got really big (Vulkan happened) and with it Lutris got bigger too and at this point it was clear no one was going to take over. Lutris was becoming a recognized open source project and I was invited to events like WineConf and Ubuntu Summit. After a lot of perceverance, it really paid off!"</p>
<h5>Q27: What has been the most rewarding aspect of developing Lutris for you personally?</h5>
<p>"It has been an excellent learning experience in plenty of fields. And it has certainly helped me get jobs more easily. But the best reward is Lutris itself. Being able to manage a large library of games spreading over decades and multiple systems."</p>

      <title>4A Games and Zen Studios staying with Embracer Group</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/saber-interactive-splits-off-from-embracer-group-taking-various-studios-with-them/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in March</a> there was the report that Saber Interactive split off from Embracer Group, with them potentially taking on 4A Games and Zen Studios.</p>
<p>Saber already took quite a few studios with them including Nimble Giant, 3D Realms, Slipgate, New World Interactive and various others but we didn't know what was going to happen with the Metro series creator 4A Games and the Pinball FX team Zen Studios.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-receives-early-payment-for-sale-of-saber-assets-4a-games-and-zen-studios-will-remain-within-embracer-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> update about the sale of Saber Interactive, Embracer Group have confirmed the "cancellation of the option for the buyer to acquire 4A Games and Zen Studios" along with an early payment from the sale.</p>

<p>“We are satisfied with the conclusion of this transaction and very glad to see the great teams and assets of 4A Games and Zen Studios remain within Embracer. They will be important building blocks in our continued journey. 4A Games has currently two AAA titles under development that we eagerly await to announce. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Matthew Karch for his contributions over the years, and at the same time congratulate the Saber team on the successful release of the iconic Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, that will make a great start in their new structure” says Lars Wingefors, co-founder and CEO of Embracer.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.11 is officially out now </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the final release of the Linux kernel 6.11, as usual with a ridiculous amount of improvements, fixes, support for new and future hardware releases and everything in between.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/9/15/282" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> here's what Linus Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm once again on the road and not in my normal timezone, but it's Sunday afternoon here in Vienna, and 6.11 is out.</p>
<p>The last week was actually pretty quiet and calm, which is nice to see. The shortlog is below for anybody who wants to look at the details, but it really isn't very many patches, and the patches are all pretty small. Nothing in particular stands out - the biggest patch in here is for Hyper-V Confidential Computing documentation.</p>
<p>Anyway, with this, the merge window will obviously open tomorrow, and I already have 40+ pull requests pending. That said, exactly _because_ I'm on the road, it will probably be a fairly slow start to the merge window, since not only am I on my laptop, there's OSS Europe starting tomorrow and then the kernel maintainer summit on Tuesday. So if I don't get to your pull request immediately, please be patient.</p>
<p>But before that merge window activity, please do give the latest release a try!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going over the full list of changes some quick highlights for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements for ROG Ally X support.</li>
<li>Lots of work for Intel Xe2 graphics support.</li>
<li>More AMD RDNA4 GPU enabling work.</li>
<li>An EXT4 filesystem optimization with "improving IOPS and throughput on fast devices running Async Direct I/O by up to 20%".</li>
<li>More control over swappiness behaviour.</li>
<li>Improvements for Snapdragon X1 Elite support including the Asus Vivobook S15 and the Lenovo Yoga Slim7x.</li>
<li>Fixes for Asus ROG 2024 laptops using CS35L41 audio support.</li>
<li>Further improvements for Framework Laptops, including their Chromebook Edition.</li>
<li>Added support for magic keyboard backlight on T2 Macs.</li>
<li>Added a DMI orientation quirk for the OrangePi Neo Linux Gaming Handheld.</li>
<li>Asus Zenbook Duo improvements for connecting / removing the keyboard.</li>
<li>Better support for the Orange Pi 3B.</li>
<li>An interesting change I spotted was to "Optimise psi_group_change a bit" from developer Tvrtko Ursulin, where they noted:
<ul>
<li>"The benefit is both in the code size and CPU time spent in this function. YMMV but on my Steam Deck, while in a game, the patch makes the CPU usage go from ~2.4% down to ~1.2%. Text size at the same time went from 0x323 to 0x2c1."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just searching through and cherry-picking random bits here. It's a ridiculously long read. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a particular change you're excited to see that made it into Linux kernel 6.11? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Windows kernel changes don&#39;t suddenly mean big things for Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of blog posts and news articles being written right now centred around Microsoft's plans for updates to Windows 11, and potential kernel changes, with some thinking this means big things for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but I'm here to bring a more realistic take and to help keep all your feet on the ground.</p>
<p>This comes from a Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/09/12/taking-steps-that-drive-resiliency-and-security-for-windows-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> titled "Taking steps that drive resiliency and security for Windows customers", which is as a result of the recent CrowdStrike incident where an update took down millions of Windows PCs due to it running at the kernel-level inside Windows.</p>
<p>One that has been really doing the rounds lately, especially across Reddit and other social media is from <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-paves-the-way-for-Linux-gaming-success-with-plan-that-would-kill-kernel-level-anti-cheat.888345.0.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>, with a rather sensational article title of "Microsoft paves the way for Linux gaming success with plan that would kill kernel-level anti-cheat".</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Microsoft <em>don't</em> actually say they will kill off kernel-level access, and <em>if</em> they tried that (again - they tried with Vista before), they will no doubt again face some pretty serious push-back from both cybersecurity vendors and regulators across various countries. Something that would likely be more hassle than its actually worth. What Microsoft <em>do</em> actually talk about, is providing <em>additional</em> options that are outside of kernel mode - a whole <em>new</em> platform to "meet the needs of security vendors".</p>
<p>This new security platform, if vendors chose to actually go ahead and use it, could mean the <em>opposite</em> for Linux gaming, and cause a whole bunch of new <em>headaches</em> when it comes to supporting it regardless of it being via Native Linux games, or Windows games through Wine and Proton. So if anything, I would say that rather than paving the way for Linux gaming to get better, it's just going to be <em>another</em> hurdle. As annoying as that is.</p>
<p>Just because some things may move out of the kernel-level, also doesn't mean things will suddenly work on Linux (or get any easier to support via Wine / Proton). There will be <em>various</em> ways for developers to detect Linux, and continue to block it.</p>
<p>Just look at Destiny 2 as the easy and simple example here, they very clearly check for and completely block Linux platforms from playing Destiny 2 via Proton with no way around it. From the official Bungie <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049024592-Destiny-2-Steam-Guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck and Destiny 2</strong></p>
<p>Destiny 2 is not supported for play on the Steam Deck or on any system utilizing Steam Play's Proton unless Windows is installed and running. Players who attempt to launch Destiny 2 on the Steam Deck through SteamOS or Proton will be unable to enter the game and will be returned to their game library after a short time.</p>
<p>Players who are not accessing Destiny 2 through Windows and attempt to bypass the SteamOS/Proton incompatibility will be met with a game ban.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You could expect to see more of that.</em></p>
<p>Then there's another easy example, Rust from Facepunch. Garry Newman has been pretty outspoken in the past about it, and how when they last had Rust supported on Linux, another Facepunch developer noted it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/facepunch-put-out-a-fresh-statement-on-rust-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">caused more cheating</a> issues for them to have to deal with.</p>
<p>How about Fortnite? That's pretty much a "lol no" event too, it's not like things being client-side will suddenly mean Fortnite would work on Linux, it would absolutely continue to be blocked. At least, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not until Linux / Steam Deck has tens of millions of users</a> according to Epic's Tim Sweeney.</p>
<p>Roblox is an additional easy example here to really make the point. Their latest anti-cheat is not kernel level, and completely blocks Linux. Something doesn't need to be in the kernel to block Linux-based systems. This caused <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/sober-is-a-new-way-to-play-roblox-on-linux-from-the-vinegar-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">projects like Sober</a> to appear to run the Android version.</p>
<p>There's really no easy answer to the anti-cheat problem for Linux / Steam Deck gaming right now, aside from perhaps developers having things done server-side where the platform you're playing on is less of an issue, or cloud gaming where the game isn't even on your machine. That's not to say it will be a problem that will never be solved, just don't expect changes to the way Windows handles things like security, anti-tamper, anti-cheat and so on to be in any way beneficial for Linux.</p>
<p>As usual, over to you in the comments: what are you thinking?</p>

      <title>European Consumer Organization goes after multiple publishers for their in-game currency</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>European Consumer Organization (BEUC) has called on the European Commission to deal with various game publishers, that the BEUC claim are breaching EU consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>The action named "<a href="https://www.beuc.eu/game-over" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game OVER</a>", was announced September 12th, in partnership with member organisations from 17 countries. Taking aim at Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Mojang Studios, Roblox Corporation, Supercell and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>What's the issue then? They identified these areas of concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumers cannot see the real cost of digital items, leading to overspending:</strong> the lack of price transparency of premium in-game currencies and the need to buy extra currency in bundles pushes consumers to spend more. </li>
<li><strong>Companies’ claims that gamers prefer in-game premium currencies are wrong. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Consumers are often denied their rights when using premium in-game currencie</strong>s, tied to unfair terms favouring game developers. </li>
<li><strong>Children are even more vulnerable to these manipulative tactics</strong>. Data shows that children in Europe are spending on average €39 per month on in-game purchases. While they are among the ones playing the most, they have limited financial literacy and are easily swayed by virtual currencies. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>: Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, commented:</p>
<p>"The online world brings new challenges for consumer protection, and it shouldn’t be a place where companies bend the rules to increase profits. BEUC’s members have identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money. Regulators must act, making it clear that even though the gaming world is virtual, it still needs to abide by real-world rules.”</p>
<p>“Gamers shouldn’t need to rely on a calculator anytime they want to make an informed decision on how much they want to spend. The money they spend should be displayed in real money and deceptive practices must be stopped.”</p>
<p>“Today, premium in-game currencies are purposefully tricking consumers and take a big toll on children. Companies are well aware of children’s vulnerability and use tricks to lure younger consumers into spending more.”</p>
<p>Video Games Europe, a trade body that represents 19 European and international video game companies and 13 national trade associations put out their own <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/video-games-europe-statement-on-in-game-currencies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> statement on it that notes:</p>
<p>"The purchase of in-game currencies is a well-established practice, and well understood by players. Our members always respect European consumer laws in how they offer these purchases.</p>
<p>Our industry offers a wide range of games that enable players to access a huge variety of genres and innovative new experiences across different services. Players can experience entire games without spending any money, giving them the opportunity to try games without any upfront cost or commitment.</p>
<p>Video Games Europe and its members support and promote fair and transparent principles for purchases of in-game content, including for in-game currency. The PEGI Code of Conduct requires developers to ensure that the real-world cost is clear and unambiguous at the point of purchase of the in-game currency."</p>
<p>This is going to be an interesting fight. </p>

      <title>WINCH IT OUT is a challenging physics-based driving-platformer like classic Flash games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer ARASLANIX are working on WINCH IT OUT, a physics-based driving-platformer, a game that reminds me of a simpler time with lots of different Flash games.</p>
<p>You've no doubt played lots and lots of platformers, but what about a platformer where you're a car? Some oldies may remember the classic stunt bike Flash games, well this thoroughly reminded me of it, only a fair bit more modern and also quite a bit trickier. The developer was directly inspired by the old Flash lot too, mentioning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a big fan of physics-based driving games, Mudrunner, Trials, and the old motocross games from the Flash era (good old times!) I've been waiting to see more games in this genre. So I decided to create one myself with that Weighty and Off-Roady feeling I’ve been craving. Hope it fills the gap for you too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, nostalgia trip out of the way. What the heck is this then?</p>
<p>The developer said "If you're tired of the same old Gas-and-Go 2D driving games and want a more challenging experience, this one's for you". You drive through Deserts, Forests, Mountains, Dungeons, and more with each biome having its own unique physics-based challenges and it's pretty tricky.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="74fDAS3b14k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/362c9f392e753d99b816e3b45ee99f04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/74fDAS3b14k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes it interesting is how you have manual control of the gears so you have full control over the speed and power, which you'll need to constantly shift about. Then there's the key with the name of the game, the winch you'll need to make great use of too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual Transmission: Full control over Power and Speed using a Manual Gear Shifter.</li>
<li>Unique Abilities: Each Car comes with a special set of abilities designed to solve specific challenges. From your trusty Winch to Boost, Dash, Chain, Glide and everything in between!</li>
<li>Grounded: There are No Backflips and you can't rotate the car in the air because it's weird!</li>
<li>Various Biomes: Deserts , Forests , Mountains, Dungeons, and more.. Each has its own set of physics-based challenges that will test your skills (and nerves!) to the max.</li>
<li>Challenging: You’ll need to think and strategize to navigate each terrain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested? You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956360/WINCH_IT_OUT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is due to release in October. There's also a demo currently available.</p>

      <title>Get drilling for oil once again in the Turmoil - Deeper Underground DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow, haven't heard of this one for a while. Released back in 2016, Turmoil is a game about drilling for oil like it's 1899 and it has a new expansion available. In case you missed it, our contributor BTRE <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/04/drilling-wells-and-selling-oil-some-thoughts-on-turmoil-and-its-dlc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reviewed the original game and the first DLC back in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Turmoil offers players a visually charming, tongue-in-cheek take on the simulation genre inspired by the 19th century oil rush in North America. Get a taste of the rush and rivalry of the time as you earn your way to become a successful oil entrepreneur. As you make money digging up and selling oil, the town will grow along with you."</p>
<p>A popular game still to this day with it regularly seeing hundreds of players, and this new DLC has given it a huge boost with a concurrent peak player count of 3,702 people in the last 24 hours which is closing in on its all-time record. The game also has a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 10,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>Check out the new DLC trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hc3MAutSiGs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/853ae69d61510293ba461dc2fa9821df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hc3MAutSiGs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Creative Director Jos Bouman said: "Creating this new DLC was not planned, but interesting ideas just popped into our heads. A few experiments validated the juiciness and fast forward two years later: Deeper Underground is here!"</p>
<p>What to expect from Deeper Underground:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An all-new town with new buildings, a new mayor, and balloon trips to special deep-drilling grounds!</li>
<li>Besides oil, you can now also find water underground - which comes in handy when you want to drill faster and cheaper! But it's also essential for the production of the highly valuable petrol!</li>
<li>Petrol marks the start of a new era. You can’t just dig it up and sell it right away, you first have to produce it in refineries. It’s a challenging but rewarding undertaking, and we trust there will be no complaints about the revenues it generates!</li>
<li>A brand new expedition: Every few in-game years, regular drilling levels are alternated with special research missions. Here, it's all about trying to drill as deep as possible with limited resources. Can you drill deeper than your opponents?</li>
<li>Two new playable characters to choose from: meet Thorpe and Mabel! Both willing and able!</li>
<li>To get your drilling operation up and running as quickly as possible, meet Yvonne, Sanjay, and Dynamite Dale who will introduce you to their new wares! And of course your old friends Edward, Raynor, Fred, and William will stop by with their train to provide you with all the drilling equipment you need.</li>
<li>Philip is also back, and he's got a new game for you: Dice Dice Dice. If you can outsmart him, you're sure to make a few extra bucks on the side.</li>
<li>Just like previous campaigns, it's all about who has the most town shares in the end. Deeper Underground uses the same bidding system as in the multiplayer campaign, but shares can also be earned in the deep-drilling missions.</li>
<li>And last but not least: we've added an explosive item to the game, dynamite! While hard rock can be nice when it comes out of speakers, it's a big problem when you stumble upon it underground. Normal drills are not strong enough, so make sure to visit Dynamite Dale in the Saloon!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.10 gets a new Snap feature to handle prompting for app permissions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical are continuing to advance their own Snap packaging system, with the Ubuntu 24.10 development builds getting a new permission prompt feature.</p>
<p>Detailed in a Discourse <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-part-5-introducing-permissions-prompting/47963/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post</a> from Canonical's Oliver Smith, the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, it goes over the idea behind this new security feature that has been multiple-years in the making. As Smith explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Permissions prompting is a critical tool for privacy and security conscious users to control, manage and understand the behaviour of applications running on their machine. This implementation represents a significant step forward in application security, and distinguishes itself from traditional XDG Desktop Portals by enabling fine-grained access control over unmodified binaries without requiring changes to the application code. By leveraging Ubuntu’s AppArmor implementation, prompting enforces sandboxing and mediates access at the system call level to ensure that every action is tightly controlled and subject to user consent, even for applications that are entirely unaware of this mediation.</p>
<p>The snapd, security and desktop teams at Canonical have collaborated closely over a number of years to bring this feature to life and we’re excited to deliver an initial opt-in implementation to Ubuntu 24.10 focussed on home interface permissions so that we can refine the experience based on your feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may end up looking something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17444687161726240296gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17444687161726240296gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I like the idea of security prompts, but it does make me think: when is putting all this on the user too much? Prompt fatigue is a very real thing, and people end up ignoring them a lot. Is there any better way though? Likely not, giving the users ultimate control on what apps do is good.</p>
<p>They have plenty of work still to do on it, which is why it won't yet be enabled by default. Some of what they plan to improve over the next few releases include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better default response suggestions based on user feedback.</li>
<li>Shell integration of the prompting pop-ups (eg full screen takeovers)</li>
<li>Improved rule management summaries and better messaging of overlapping or redundant prompts.</li>
<li>Expansion of the prompting system to cover additional snap interfaces such as camera and microphone access.</li>
<li>Smarter client side analysis of prompts, recommending additional options if multiple similar prompts are detected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.2 Beta released and Plasma Wayland Protocols 1.14 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time for a little testing over the weekend, as the KDE team have released Plasma 6.2 Beta along with updated Plasma Wayland Protocols.</p>
<p>Some of the major changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Valve puts two Steam Deck LCD models on sale for Steam&#39;s birthday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's Steam's birthday? Wow, I forgot, did you? To celebrate a little bit, Valve are giving you the chance to give them even more money by picking up a cheap Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The models that are being phased-out have been discounted until September 26th so you can grab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck LCD 64GB with 15% off.</li>
<li>Steam Deck LCD 512GB with 25% off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course that's only while stocks last, and they're likely quite limited and will probably sell-out reasonably quickly, which they have done before. So if you've been really on the fence, this is your best chance. The 64GB paired up with a SSD upgrade is always a great choice. Although for the convenience of 512GB and the anti-glare screen, the higher model is a <em>ridiculously</em> good price with the sale.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4619787351726161796gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>See the sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam Deck store</a>.</p>
<p>21 years of Steam huh? Wow. What's your favourite Steam related memory? Mine is obviously Steam coming to Linux, and trying to get it all working. What a wild ride.</p>

      <title>Unity cancels the stupid Runtime Fee</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a complete disaster a while ago that saw many developers jump-ship, and cause a huge PR problem, Unity have now <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancelled</a> the Runtime Fee.</p>
<p>Instead, they're reverting back to the seat-based subscription model for gaming customers, however they said "Non-gaming Industry customers are not impacted by this modification". This applies to everyone using Unity for gaming, even those that choose to upgrade to Unity 6.</p>
<p>In the post written by Matt Bromberg, the President and CEO of Unity, they mentioned they will go with a "more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis" and that "if we change the Editor software terms in ways that impact you, you may continue using your current version of the software under the previously agreed terms". Hopefully they actually keep to that properly this time.</p>
<p>What the plans will look like now:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Personal: </strong>As announced last year, Unity Personal<strong> </strong>will remain free, and we’ll be doubling the current revenue and funding ceiling from $100,000 to $200,000 USD. This means more of you can use Unity at no cost. The Made with Unity splash screen will become optional for Unity Personal games made with Unity 6 when it launches later this year.</li>
<li><strong>Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise: </strong>We’ll be modifying subscription pricing and the qualifying annual revenue thresholds, effective January 1, 2025. These changes will apply to all new and existing Unity Pro and Enterprise customers when you purchase, upgrade, or renew a subscription on or after this date.
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Pro:</strong> An 8% subscription price increase to $2,200 USD annually per seat will apply to Unity Pro. Unity Pro will be required for customers with more than $200,000 USD of total annual revenue and funding.</li>
<li><strong>Unity Enterprise:</strong> A 25% subscription price increase will apply to Unity Enterprise. Unity Enterprise will be required for customers with more than $25 million USD of total annual revenue and funding. A minimum subscription requirement may also apply. Because this set of our largest customers have unique needs and use many of our products and services, we’ll be contacting everyone in the days ahead to discuss customized packages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Pretty big bump in prices there for Pro and Enterprise though.</em></p>
<p>This is a nice win for game developers, because it really was a stupid policy having an individual install fee.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor gets Denuvo DRM removed, plus performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for DRM haters. STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor has been liberated as of the latest update which also thankfully continues improving the performance too.</p>
<p>I've actually held off on playing it through fully myself due to how bad the initial release was, so maybe I'll be jumping back in to get it done now too. That's the problem with games that are pushed out too soon, of which we've seen a shocking lot of lately, there's so many other games coming out that you can easily move onto.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13419889431726151760gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Respawn / EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> Patch 9 today which notes very clearly "Denuvo DRM has been removed". Plus these other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Performance Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Framerate improvements for various hardware configurations.</li>
<li>Fixes for several sources of framerate hitching for smoother gameplay.</li>
<li>Ray Tracing has been optimized for CPU usage and should now scale better for high-end GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixes for performance related to using a mouse as gameplay input.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The “Optimizing Game Files” screen has been optimized and can now see speed increases from multiple CPU cores.</li>
<li>Mouse and keyboard functionality has been improved across a variety of menu screens, including the first time user screens, title menu, game menu, and workbench.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed collision issue where players could fall through elevators at low framerates.</li>
<li>Fix for a conversation-related crash when walking away from NPC characters.</li>
<li>Fix for various, intermittent crashes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you've been holding off, it truly sounds like this is the absolute best time to grab it. Unless you're waiting on a sale that is, in which case fair enough.</p>

      <title>Wizard of Legend 2 comes to Early Access on October 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original Wizard of Legend was absolutely brilliant when it came out, fun solo and great fun in co-op with the spell combinations and great action. So I expect good things from Wizard of Legend 2.</p>
<p>Announced today, it's entering Early Access on October 3rd. This time though, it will only officially support Windows, so Linux Desktop / Steam Deck players will need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before: it's an action-packed rogue-lite in which players take on perilous, ever-shifting trials across various types of environments filled with all sorts of enemies. Since you're all Wizards, you get to wield various different elemental magics that you combine together to form all your attacks. This time around you get a more 3D environment which looks rather pretty. Co-op is back too, and at the 1.0 release they will bump it up to 4 players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T2ycv86a3Us"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73a0603190c224189455e90ccafb6639.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T2ycv86a3Us" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced 3D Visuals: Experience the Floating Lands like never before with stunning new 3D graphics that bring the world’s vibrant and dynamic magic to life.</li>
<li>Co-Op Magic: Team up with a friend in 2 player co-op at launch, with plans to expand to 4-player co-op in future updates. Whether you choose local or online play, coordinating with allies will be key to conquering the trials.</li>
<li>Master New and Familiar Arcana: Command a range of elemental powers including fire, water, earth, lightning, air, and chaos. Discover new Arcana and experiment with spell combinations that can drastically alter your gameplay.</li>
<li>Rogue-Lite Replayability: Each trial is uniquely challenging, with procedurally generated elements and a persistent progression system. Expect around 10-15 hours of gameplay, but with the rogue-lite structure, replayability is endless.</li>
<li>Community-Driven Development: The shift to Early Access comes in response to valuable feedback from the Steam Next Fest demo. The development team is committed to using this feedback to refine and enhance the game, ensuring that Wizard of Legend 2 delivers the best possible experience.</li>
<li>Trial-Ready Gauntlet: Navigate the ever-shifting gauntlet conjured by Hieronymus, Lanova’s wizard supreme, and encounter a diverse array of trials overseen by the enigmatic members of the wizarding council.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193540/Wizard_of_Legend_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. I'm hoping to take a look at this one for the release, since I enjoyed the first so much, so I'll report on how it runs with Proton.</p>

      <title>With some really intense fights, action-adventure Veil of Shadows is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Veil of Shadows from Imponix Game Studio is out today, bringing with it an action-adventure with some gorgeous pixel-art. It has full Native Linux support and there's also a demo available.</p>
<p>More about it: "Sirene wakes up in a forest with few memories of how she ended up there. Her journey begins by trying to understand what is happening to her and soon having to fight for her survival. Help Sirene understand what is going on and escape this agony."</p>
<p>The idea of the game is that you're collecting fragments of your memory. Each piece you get slowly brings it all together towards the finale where you will uncover the truth of your strange appearance in the forest. Yes, I know, the whole protagonist with amnesia thing again but it's quite a good one. With combat inspired by the classics mechanically, you get a bit of freedom in how you tackle all the fights due to ability upgrades and game-changing perks too.</p>

      <title>Wine team now hosting Mono, looking to adopt the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the news recently that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/microsoft-donates-the-mono-project-to-the-wine-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft gave the Mono Project over to the Wine</a> team, it has now been moved over to the Wine GitLab. Plus, some changes for Wine contributors may be coming with a new Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>A bunch of changes were <a href="https://marc.info/?l=wine-devel&amp;m=172608188630928&amp;w=2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on the Wine Developer mailing list from Alexandre Julliard. Which include some modernisation for the project. The Wiki was moved over to their GitLab along with appdb, vkd3d and wine-staging having their own Wiki too.</p>
<p>The Mono Project is now hosted directly by the Wine team on their GitLab, plus they've upgraded the server hardware for their GitLab which is "now noticeably faster" which will hopefully aid development for all the contributors long into the future.</p>
<p>Sadly they've had a bit of a spam problem which is why GitLab issue trackers were disabled, but they're going to be re-enabled with "an explicit user verification step, modelled along the procedure used by Freedesktop.org".</p>
<p>Lastly, along with the new sign-up process, they're currently looking into forming a proper Code of Conduct to "spell out our expectations". They're currently looking into using the popular <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Contributor Covenant</a>, which was designed especially for open source communities. The Contributor Covenant is pretty simple to understand, and a lot of it is based on just reinforcing acceptable behaviour, not particularly different to the rules most forums have (including our comments and forum).</p>

      <title>JRPG-inspired adventure with a puzzle-battle system &#39;Flowstone Saga&#39; launches September 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Impact Gameworks, developer of the popular and rather fantastic Tangledeep, have announced recently that their brand new game Flowstone Saga launches on September 17th. This unique blend of a 16-bit JRPG-inspired world with a puzzle-battle system really looks great, and it will have Native Linux support just like the first game.</p>
<p>More about it: "Enter the world of Ocean’s End and play as Mirai – a spunky heroine who builds her party and home as she begins to embrace her new-found powers and find her place in the world. With an innovative twist on combat, Flowstone Saga allows players to choose at will between turn-based and real-time combat – skillfully making use of puzzle combat mechanics to shake things up. Tactical thinking triumphs over pirates, giant beetles, and at least ONE axolotl! Fans of classic SNES and PlayStation RPGs will feel right at home as they explore, build, fight, and cast their way through Flowstone Saga’s mysterious world."</p>

      <title>Looking to upgrade your Steam Deck? How about some fancy metal buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deck Buttons have released a fresh set of fancy button upgrades for your Steam Deck, this time blending together real metal and high-quality resin for a really unique look.</p>
<p>They already sold a fair few different types of button upgrades to replace inside your Steam Deck like a Game Boy inspired set and various Neon colours but their latest selection is quite different. Although, swapping out the buttons can be quite a pain to do since it requires some very careful backplate removal and removing various parts inside the Deck. Still, they look <em>awesome</em>!</p>
<p>Available across copper and aluminium you can style them a bit yourself, although they ship looking "raw" you could polish them or perhaps use some steel wool to give them a brushed-like effect. There's a few possibilities here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3243112171726140648gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3243112171726140648gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19062762681726140649gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19062762681726140649gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Available for pre-order with shipping expected in the second week of October.</p>
<p>Check out the overview video below and see more on <a href="https://deckbuttons.com/products/metal_steam_deck_buttons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the web store</a>:</p>

      <title>Hive Jump 2: Survivors is an addictive blend of Vampire Survivors and Brotato with a Jetpack</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There may come a day where I get tired of survivor-like bullet hell shooters, but it's clearly not today. Hive Jump 2: Survivors just released and I've had a real blast with it. It was previously in Early Access, with the 1.0 release out now. <em>Note: Key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>Here you're tasked with a pretty simple objective: take down the alien hives while lasting as long as you can, which is a lot easier said than done. It has the usual staples of the genre that we've come to know and love with various types of enemies to squash, where you pick up little experience orbs to level up and pick from upgrades which Vampire Survivors made popular.</p>
<p>It also blends in the shop system that made Brotato great too. It's a wave-based auto-shooter, and when a wave is finished you can then buy weapons from a shop, or combine two of the same type (and same level) to make something even more powerful. Eventually, you can become a true bug-stomping machine. However, you never actually feel over-powered.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3708102931726138375gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3708102931726138375gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16273042431726138376gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16273042431726138376gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Hive Jump 2: Survivors with my favourite upgrade, the electric fence.</em></p>
<p>In Hive Jump 2: Survivors though you only have a very limited selection of weapons available, which makes the decision on what build to go for a little harder when you keep being presented with new weapon options but you're already into upgrading a few.</p>
<p>Part of the fun here is your Jetpack. You can use it to quickly hop over enemies and obstacles. A lot of the upgrades are linked to it to (not all, but quite a few). So you can move faster, shoot faster, throw grenades more quickly and so on while you're boosting yourself around. It nicely adds to the chaos and makes it different enough that it's not a bore to play and not yet-another plain survivor-like clone. It thankfully still manages to feel unique and just a thorough blast to play through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WrZTI0i7Iqo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b46b58b35b2c3b829d23c7cce5957364.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WrZTI0i7Iqo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a few other fun features included to set it apart too. There's a challenge system that pops up now and then to give you some extras like taking no damage from enemies for a wave. Add to that the point of the game: taking down alien hives. These are bullet-sponges, that can take a moment to destroy while you're also being swarmed by aliens. Once destroyed though, you then get a special equipment drop to give a big buff to something.</p>
<p>Really challenging with the different types of bugs too, there's even a little Starship Troopers thrown in there with artillery bugs that shoot out of their back. They're damn annoying when you're already surrounded.</p>
<p>A nice meta-upgrade system too, so going through numerous runs does actually have a point to it. There's a few characters to unlock with different starting weapons or abilities. Plus there's about 35 other types of meta-upgrades from health to movement speed, increases for different types of games to better wave-finish store prices and more.</p>
<p>The only real complaints I have is that firstly I would have loved to see more variety in the weapons. What's there is great fun to annihilate the bug menace with, but I would have just liked to see some more different types. Additionally, more map variety would have been good too. Another slight nuisance is the upgrade system when you've started upgrading your three slots, it gives you too many options you can't use without replacing what you have. Some tweaks there would be nice to see.</p>
<p>Overall, Hive Jump 2: Survivors nicely sets itself apart in a genre that's now getting swarmed. It's absolutely worth picking up if you enjoy a <em>lot</em> of action and testing out various different character builds.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader 3.0 is out now for Steam Deck plugins on the latest Steam update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Many months in the making, the Decky Loader developers have released version 3.0 of their Steam Deck plugin system, which works with the big Steam Families update. So you'll need to update to continue using Decky Loader, as the 2.x series breaks on the new Steam Client update.</p>
<p>The developers are keen to note that if you were on the Decky Loader pre-release branch due to being in the Steam Beta, you'll need to switch back to Decky Loader stable now since the pre-release builds are "frequently updated branch that provides no promises of stability".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12250499041726132966gol1.png"/></p>
<p>What's actually changed? Frankly, there's too many individual improvements to list. But some quick highlights:</p>
<p>For users it should provide a more stable experience overall. There's better error handling, more in-depth progress notifications for Decky and plugins. Along with Decky being properly usable without an internet connection. There's also various UI styling improvements. You should also hopefully never see the boot-loop problem again with some recent changes.</p>
<p>For developers they overhauled the plugin API so it should be significantly easier to use, and also now asynchronous. Plus an easy way was added for backend to frontend communication. Plugin developers will likely need to go back and update any they've made.</p>
<p>See more about Decky Loader on the <a href="https://decky.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Families has officially launched with a big Steam Client Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck, Valve has officially launched the new Steam Families system in a stable Steam Client Update. <em>The system was in Beta since March.</em></p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> yet bring Steam Game Recording into the stable client, but it does make some UI changes to prepare for it. You'll still need to stay opted into the Beta for all that, but hopefully that will properly ship soon too.</p>
<p>For those who haven't been in the Beta, it <em>finally</em> means your whole Steam Library doesn't get locked down when someone is playing a completely different game. Amongst many other nice improvements like vastly improved parental controls. Overall, a really great update that continues to show why most people prefer Steam.</p>

      <title>CATO: Buttered Cat is a truly charming puzzle platformer based on the buttered-cat paradox</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Memes, jokes and games don't always blend together well or age well in video games, but CATO: Buttered Cat does it very playfully with the right idea and it's just wonderful. <em>Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>It's based on the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttered_cat_paradox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Buttered cat paradox</a>", which is the question of: will a cat will land on their feet or back when strapped with buttered toast that's butter-side up? Clearly, it's vital research that must be done.</p>
<p>Few games make me chuckle and smile away from the first few minutes but CATO: Buttered Cat really did. From the way CATO looks like a stretched-ferret when travelling through pipes, to the dedicated button to Meow that doubles up as a restart button if you're stuck when you hold it down. Just so many small touches make it a rewarding experience to play through.</p>
<p>And who doesn't like a game where there's talking toast, that when combined with a cat allows you to spin up in the air? No it doesn't make even the tiniest bit of sense, but it's visually charming as heck. This sentient talking buttered toast that's afraid of being burnt can also hop off your back, which is often required to pass various sections of the game, where you end up controlling both toast and CATO.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_cXwNxQz1jg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/36eed971853004a4e38222305a173caa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_cXwNxQz1jg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The levels are small but very cleverly designed to use the space well thanks to the game mechanics. A lot of the game is really just planning out your route through these little puzzles. While the toast gives you floating powers, it cannot be used with CATO all the time, and having it attached often blocks your path. Toast is also used to power various devices, as is CATO, so you need to separate them often. <em>Don't worry though, no butter gets stuck in your fur. At least that's what toast tells me.</em></p>
<p>So you need to work out how to get both CATO and toast through various annoyances to bring them back together. CATO cannot jump (I told you it doesn't make sense), but can climb up scratching posts and go through pipes. While toast can fire itself off like a projectile either left or right and momentarily stick to walls when not attached to CATO. So there's lots of running, climbing and toast throwing to be done to figure out how to get to the end.</p>
<p>Platforming in this isn't even difficult, not even remotely so. It is primarily a puzzle game, wearing the skin of a retro-platformer. There's also a few fun little mini-games! A couple of the levels are definitely head-scratchers though, the design really is great.</p>
<p>Genuinely great fun that will make you really think and probably laugh a fair bit too.</p>
<p>You can<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999520/CATO_Buttered_Cat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and should work just fine on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Occult library builder BOOK OF HOURS: HOUSE OF LIGHT DLC launches September 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Weather Factory (who made <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Cultist+Simulator&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cultist Simulator</a>) are set to release BOOK OF HOURS: HOUSE OF LIGHT, an expansion to their occult library restoration building RPG on September 26. <em>Note: the developer sent over a key.</em></p>
<p>The combat-free crafting RPG set in an occult library is set to expand in a big way. The DLC will bring in big new features like Social Events, allowing you to host exotic dinner parties for a whole bunch of strange people. Here you'll need to pick the location inside your library and deal with food, drink, ambience and timing where a "successful soirée will influence the world in subtle ways, sending ripples far beyond your walls".</p>
<p>It also adds in a cooking system where you dive "into the dangerous world of 1930s European recipes and influence your attendees with your choice of spices, sweetmeats and dainties". There's also more advanced visitor stories, with you able to invite them over to visit any time. Plus you'll get to pick your favourites to set up the influential Lighthouse Institute to "set its course through the world".</p>
<p>Original launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="38D565xKp-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07d8dc4778c4c32bad9417c492edff6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/38D565xKp-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release the DLC will be priced at $14.99 / £12.99 / €13.99.</p>
<p>From what the developers told me the base game was one of 2023's unlikely indie hits. It sold more than 44,000 copies on Steam in its first month of sale with a Very Positive rating overall on Steam. If you like something a bit slower and just thoroughly <em>different</em> to what a lot of developers are putting out, this could be worth a look.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/book_of_hours?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1028310/BOOK_OF_HOURS/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Tower of Babel: Survivors Of Chaos could by my next favourite hack-and-slash survivor-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tower of Babel: Survivors Of Chaos is coming to Steam and at least based on the very short teaser trailer, it looks like it could be one I'll sink a lot of hours into.</p>
<p>Blending together elements of the survivor-like bullet heaven / hell stuff popularised by Vampire Survivors, with a bit more of a hack and slash RPG feel to it. </p>
<p>More about it: "Battle relentless waves of enemies, acquire new skills, and upgrade your abilities. Become stronger with new gear and weapons. With a unique character build and numerous item combinations, your goal is to ascend to the top level. Join forces with heroes who have gathered for their own missions, defeat the swarming monsters, and reach the top of the Tower of Babel. Though its origins are shrouded in mystery, legend says that those who reach the top can obtain everything they desire."</p>
<p>Check out the brief teaser:</p>

<p>Writing on Steam the developer posted an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2665680/view/4577433480058488361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on August 30th to note that it has been "fully optimized for the Steam Deck experience". Nice to see more developers testing early and announcing it. They definitely have my attention on this one.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous Hand-Drawn 2D Dark Fantasy Graphics.</li>

      <title>Horror point and click adventure Devil&#39;s Hideout is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cosmic Void developers of Twilight Oracle, Blood Nova and The Corruption Within have released their latest point and click adventure with Devil's Hideout. The developers did a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shdon/devils-hideout-a-horror-point-and-click-adventure-game/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> crowdfunding campaign earlier this year, where they managed to raise €11,458 to finish it.</p>
<p>More about it: "Devil's Hideout is a fully-voiced horror point and click adventure. Lauren learns from a mystic that her young sister is still alive, with cultists staging her death. Traveling to the hospital where her sister received care, Lauren plunges headfirst into a nightmare. The world of Devil's Hideout is pure horror - narratively, aurally, and visually. Playing as Lauren, explore an abandoned hospital and a nearby town to find her young sister. Solve puzzles with the help of her friend Atticus, as you delve the insidious shadows of Devil's Hideout."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Immersive pixel art, saturated with horror.</li>

<li>Spine-chilling music and sound effects.</li>
<li>Explore an abandoned town &amp; hospital.</li>

<p>Nice to see the point and clicking adventure genre is very much alive and well.</p>

      <title>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest are getting offline modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In news that might hopefully be good for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux players with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest are getting offline modes.</p>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/1fiTcUyVqBbYf2zM4uhaaR/the-crew-motorfest-year-2-brings-new-island-and-more-on-november-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> this yesterday (September 10th), as they're clearly taking notes on how they <em>badly</em> handled The Crew when shutting it off and all players losing access to it, which ended up creating the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/stop-killing-games-is-a-new-campaign-to-stop-developers-making-games-unplayable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games initiative</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ubisoft news post was this notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, Ubisoft Ivory Tower committed to long-term access for both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest, ensuring that both games will be playable for many years to come, including in an offline mode coming in the future. Players who still haven't picked up The Crew 2 can do so for just one dollar from September 10-24, and will be able to unlock four different vehicles with only one Crew Credit. From now until September 23, you can save up to 70% on The Crew Motorfest or 98% on The Crew 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently though, both games are broken on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton, due to the anti-cheat. So I'm hopefully at the very least the offline mode will actually work, since there would be no reason to have that part of each blocked.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft to see if they plan to get either working.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Cosmic Storms and the free 3.13 &#39;Vela&#39; update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developed in collaboration with Behaviour Interactive, the new Stellaris: Cosmic Storms expansion and free 3.13 'Vela' update are out now.</p>
<p>With this new expansion you'll find new types of space storms that will begin to randomly spawn a few years into a game. They have a cool-down and there's a hard limit on how many can spawn during the early, mid and late game but these can be configured during the pre-game setup. However, since you can also now spawn your own storms they will happen regardless.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">DLC highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8 New Space Storms.</li>
<li>Storm Chasers Origin.</li>
<li>3 New Civics:
<ul>
<li>Planetscapers.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The free update had various bug fixes and improvements like changes to planetary resource deposits. Instead of giving access to Crystal Mines, Gas Extraction Wells, and Mote Harvesting Traps they now increase the number of mining districts available on the planet and, after researching the technology to extract the relevant resource, add a small amount of resource production to miners on that planet. Additionally Penal Colonies now reduce crime across your empire while giving access to unique Prison Industrial Districts, while Thrall Worlds give access to the Battle Thrall District to give armies additional XP, and Battle Thrall jobs will increase the damage your armies do.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta has a fix for exiting non-Steam games causing input issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh small Steam Beta was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4578560647859631409" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a>, and for those of you on Steam Deck who play non-Steam games and emulators it's going to be a useful one.</p>
<p>Initially the Steam Beta update came with these two adjustments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>For games that have not released yet, display the release information in game hovers when available.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with padding for friends in the game invite dialog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But then Valve re-released it to add in another fix they noted was for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where exiting a non-Steam game could leave controllers w/o input until you hit the guide button or QAM button.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you noticed some weird input issues, perhaps that will get it fixed for you.</p>

      <title>Terrorformer TD is a seriously good tower defense game where you shape the battlefield</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's hard to pull me away from Bloons TD 6, but Terrorformer TD has managed to do it. A tower defense game where you constantly tweak the battlefield as time goes on. <em>Note: key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>The key here is in the name: terraforming. The maps are tile-based, with most tiles allowing you to move them up to block paths or down to open them up. This allows you to push enemies from spawners into a specific direction you have covered. Not just that, you can move terrain tiles up from underneath your towers too to give them a nice big buff. This one feature really does make it feel unique and really interesting to play through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5015889451725978794gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5015889451725978794gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's also different here is that you can seal enemy spawners permanently shut. Each time you seal all that are currently on the map, the map then <em>grows</em> with new spawners appearing. So everything about the game layout keeps changing the longer you play so it's incredibly dynamic. As time goes on enemies will get larger in number, and stronger too, so it's not just the map changes you need to keep thinking on but your own strategy on how to deal with them all.</p>
<p>Since it's a tower defense game, you have one main home tower to defend with limited health. This tower is customizable too, eventually when you unlock more anyway, so you can have a different type of home tower depending on how you wish to play.</p>
<p>Each round you succeed you get given a certain amount of resources across gold to buy towers and upgrade, map points to terraform and seal spawners, mana to cast spells and more. After each round you then get to spend all these resources to unlock new towers, upgrade towers, exchange one resource for another and more.</p>
<p>With a large number of towers with various strengths and weaknesses, each being able to individually level-up and be moved around tiles whenever you want, there's really a lot here to keep you interested to just have that one more run. Plenty of randomization here too with your available unlocks, upgrades, and a map erosion that's different each time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GAKGUtJxrsQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/886814dc7df9d9411e28a0878d028a1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GAKGUtJxrsQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot to love about this one, well worth picking up if you're a TD fan. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 Unique Towers, each with Tech Tree (300 total upgrades).</li>
<li>45 Enemies with distinct models, stats &amp; behaviour.</li>
<li>5 Game Maps (4 unlockable).</li>
<li>13 Spells (12 unlockable).</li>
<li>20 Status Effects to inflict and/or counter.</li>
<li>5 Difficulty levels (2 unlockable).</li>
<li>Persistent Player XP across games.</li>
<li>25+ Unlockable Home Tower Components.</li>
<li>95+ Earnable Perks.</li>
<li>75+ Achievements.</li>
<li>Global Leaderboards (per Map).</li>
<li>Weekly Challenges w/ Leaderboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developed by onewinter games, a one-man army solo indie dev. The game began as a Master of Fine Arts thesis project for onewinter's TJ Cioffe and quickly developed into a passion project inspired by his love for custom Starcraft and Warcraft maps from his childhood. </p>

      <title>Elsie is a love letter to action-platformers with a roguelike twist that looks fantastic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Spray Paint Simulator looks like it will suck me in as badly as PowerWash Simulator did</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of the more casual side of gaming: just announced today is Spray Paint Simulator, one fans of PowerWash Simulator will probably also love and spend hours in. Coming to Steam sometime in 2025, it looks <em>exactly</em> like the chilled-out kind of thing I want.</p>

      <title>An interview with the developers of the Heroic Games Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested in a little background on the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, how it came to be and what challenges it comes with? Here's an interview with some of the developers responsible.</p>
<p>What is the Heroic Games Launcher? It's a free and open source games launcher / manager for Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Prime Games that's available for Linux (and Steam Deck), macOS and Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this was originally posted on Reddit, with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flwwhtrbt/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">user</a> sending it over to GamingOnLinux for republishing. We did previously have our own direct interview <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-the-heroic-games-launcher/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in early 2023</a> but this touches on a fair bit more. We're just providing a space here for more people to see it and learn more.</p>
<p>Here's the interview:</p>
<h4>Introduction and Background</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Can you tell us a bit about yourselves and what inspired you to start working on Heroic Launcher? Was it everyone's love of gaming or programming that made you all take the leap?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "I believe it was a good mix of both. For me, I wanted to play the games I own on the Epic Games Store. Their launcher is... not the best, it's even worse on Linux (at least it was at the time). A friend pointed me towards Legendary, a command-line cross-platform replacement for the launcher. Heroic then emerged from that as the logical next step (a graphical user interface). After about a year of waiting for it to mature, I moved my games over from Legendary to Heroic, found something I could improve, submitted that change, and the rest is history."</p>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "Definitely both, but with more emphasis on programming. I was getting started with Linux and open source in general. Even though I started contributing with translations, I wanted to eventually contribute with code. I believe my first code change was about the new UI for login. After some smaller changes, I eventually picked up a highly requested feature - GOG support."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I was more into the programming side. I don’t play much and I wasn’t even an Epic Games user, but I wanted to contribute to a project that would help users and learn new skills at the same time. It felt like a good fit for me. I started with just some really small things like fixing a shortcut bug or basic stuff, but eventually, things started to make sense. After some time, it feels really nice to know that you are doing something that is helping a lot of people."</p>
<p><strong>Etaash:</strong> "I was tired of using Lutris at the time. It had a lot of bugs (most of them fixed now), and it is written in Python, so that turned me away from contributing to fix those issues (Python is unreadable for me, who primarily programs in C/C++). I looked for alternatives and eventually found Heroic, which suited my needs since all I needed was to launch Epic games. Heroic was a bit more stable, but it also wasn’t stable enough, so I decided to dig into the code a bit. Since it was TypeScript, I was able to follow it. If I remember correctly, most of the issues were caused by how Heroic interacted with Wine. Fixing those issues allowed games to launch more consistently out of the box. Since then, I have kept my focus on that one area: maximizing game compatibility."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I was kind of bored on a pretty cold and snowy black winter day in Sweden during the holidays. Didn’t have plans and was off from work for two weeks, so I decided to learn something new. I was already using Legendary on Linux to play a few games. I started using it to play <em>Control</em> when it was released, and it was Epic exclusive. It was a pain at the time since gaming on Linux was not exactly easy 4 years ago; things have improved a lot since then. So, since I wanted to learn something new, I started researching how to build a GUI for Legendary just for fun. In two days, I was able to come up with a simple GUI that already dealt with login, listing games, selecting different wine versions and prefixes, etc. The basis of what became Heroic today."</p>
<h5>What was the initial goal you had in mind when you first started developing Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p>"Heroic started as Flavio’s side project. He was using Legendary for accessing Epic and decided to make a GUI application for it. It was also a way to gain more experience with Electron and web technologies. This is what the project was mostly about: just a simple way to browse and launch games. If you want some more history lessons, make sure to check out <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v1.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">old releases</a>."</p>
<h5>How has the project evolved since its inception?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "The first year was kind of slow, and I honestly thought of giving up several times. There was a lot of criticism from the community since it was using Electron and it was for Epic games, and people love to hate Epic and Electron. I worked basically alone the first year, with just a few contributions here and there.</p>
<p>The second year was when things started to grow far beyond my control and got a lot of traction and media coverage. Releasing it for macOS and Windows was also a big leap, and nowadays we have around 10% of users on macOS and 25% on Windows, for people that hate how bad Epic Games launcher is there. Adding other stores was always a goal, but finding the time to dedicate to it was pretty harsh. But luckily, we had Paweł joining and working with other members of the community to crack GOG and then Amazon.</p>
<p>After adding GOG, the community and even the sceptical people started embracing Heroic more and more."</p>
<h5>Were there any significant challenges you faced during the initial development process? Before your first release?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Before the first release, I cannot think of big challenges. Most of the work was being done by Legendary and Wine on the backend. Heroic was basically just sending the commands to it; it was pretty simple at first. I think the hardest part was dealing with the community that had a few folks that were basically just trying to criticize the project on every change, even though it was free, open-source, and not using their time and effort."</p>
<h5>What keeps you motivated to continue developing and improving Heroic Launcher? It's been some time now since its inception, and I know motivation can ebb with time. What keeps all of you having the fire to keep this improving?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "The fact that there is still so much to improve is my primary source of motivation. I know that for everything I implement, someone out there will be happy that it was done (even if that someone is just myself; we all personally use Heroic as well, after all)."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I have a looooong TODO list of things I want to try. Some items are to fix something I encounter and bugs me, other things are just ideas I have, and Heroic is a great app for me to experiment and learn. Also, the feeling of fixing something that was bothering other people and knowing I helped feels good."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "The biggest motivation is to keep bringing fun to this huge community that embraced our project and are always eager to have new features and things that will make play more fun than frustration, especially on Linux and macOS where we need to deal with compatibility layers like Wine, Proton, GPTK, etc. Especially when you are new to those and have no idea how it works. Heroic tries to make everything as click-and-play as possible.</p>
<p>Also, Heroic made me connect with so many nice people from the FOSS community, and even to get my current job, and I think other contributors also found nice jobs because of it. This is something that makes me very happy as well."</p>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "Game stores other than Steam usually treat Linux as second-class citizens if they even support it as a platform. What keeps me going is the fact that we get to make a difference on what game stores become approachable to less tech-savvy users."</p>
<h5>I see at least one dev here is an outspoken Linux-user (seeing someone on Mastodon is rare enough to make me take notice!) Was there an element of that love of FOSS which led you to look into the Steam Deck itself (being the 'one' Linux handheld which has become mainstream)?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I’ve been a Windows-less user for many many years now, and I remember like 15-20 years ago how I struggled with gaming on Linux. In the last few years, things are SO much better, and when the Steam Deck was announced, it was a no-brainer for me. The only problem was that it’s not available in my country, so I had to get some family members to travel and get one for me. I don’t use it that much now, but I use it also as a way to tell people “see? You don’t need Windows for this”."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Yeah, like Ariel, I am also a primary Linux user since around 2007 when I got my first PC. Always tried to play games on Linux somehow, and it was always a pain. When Steam launched a Linux version, I think around 2012, it was a huge thing for me, and I was basically just buying games with the Linux version at the time. With the launch of Proton around 2018-2019, I guess the game changed totally, and since I play mostly single-player games, I can play 99% of my library on Linux and on the Steam Deck."</p>
<h5>Is everyone a Steam Deck user?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I am. I don’t use it much lately, but I sometimes go back for a while."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Yes, actually my first Steam Deck I was able to buy only with donations from Heroic Patreon and Ko-fi. I finished a lot of games on it, especially Metroidvanias, which is my passion."</p>
<p><strong>Etaash:</strong> "Unfortunately, I don’t have a Steam Deck."</p>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "Yes, I am. The Deck is a great travel companion."</p>

<em>Pictured - Heroic Games Launcher on Linux</em></p>
<h4>Development and Features</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>What were some of the more unique features you were excited to add to Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "Well, anything store-specific definitely was unique, but it wouldn't necessarily get me excited (Epic has added... 5? different features into their API exclusively used by Fortnite, each one becoming more cryptic). I've recently added a new system information gathering tool into Heroic to help with support requests; getting into the weeds of PCI databases and WMI classes was fun (and we now detect GPUs more accurately than NVIDIA &amp; AMD's own tools!)."</p>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "I’m very, very proud of what we’ve done with GOG support. Most solutions that are really similar to Heroic rely on offline installers for game downloads. While this isn’t a big deal for the most part, the system is slow to provide updates and requires manual input to apply them. Heroic is closer to what GOG Galaxy is; it’s able to download an update instantly after it’s been released. We can also access password-protected Beta releases of games. This is especially useful for game developers who want to test things before making them public."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I was really into accessibility at some point. I think Heroic is really user-friendly, and we were lacking some things. Also, the feature to control the interface with a gamepad is something I’m really happy with how it worked (and we wanted that before the Steam Deck release). It still has some problems and rough edges, but the experience is good enough, I think. I’m also really happy with the “known fixes” feature to automatically apply fixes we know for specific games (kinda like proton-fixes, so not that unique, but specific to Heroic). It helped a lot to make more games work out of the box."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "When I think of new features, I think of things that add more value to the end users and myself since I also use Heroic a lot. So things that I am always excited about are to add either more stores to it or to improve the compatibility layer to be able to play games easily without having to tinker a lot with settings, etc."​</p>
<h5>Can you share an interesting story from the development phase? With each dev in a different country, I can imagine your time-zones are a battle in and of itself!</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "Communication is inherently asynchronous, that's true. I hope I've not woken the others up in the middle of the night too many times while bugging them to help me with something. I can't point to one interesting story in particular, but I believe the whole journey was (and still is!) interesting. Being able to hack on software in a small team while never having seen one another in person is a cool feeling."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I think we actually only met once in a call in the last 3/4 years? And we were not even all there, but it’s weird, you kinda end up knowing the rest a bit even if you don’t really share much time. I don’t think the time zones were ever a problem, to be honest. We are all really good at doing things async, and we know that whenever you ask something, there’s a good chance nobody is there and you’ll have to wait (I’m in South America, so if I do something at 12-1am my time, the rest of the team is most likely sleeping in Europe)."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I think that for most FOSS projects, async communication is the default rule, and dealing with time zones is fine. There were some times where I was not available, and we had some major bugs to fix, and the other devs were waiting for me to make the release. But besides that, things work pretty well for us. We have pretty good communication, and we know each other very well as well."</p>
<h5>​How do you decide which new features or improvements to prioritize?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "Other than "thing is on fire and needs fixing right now" type of issues, it is mostly just gut feeling. Of course, I can only work on things I know need working on (so either it's something I personally want to do or it's suggested by someone in the community)."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I try to think, “of all these ideas I have, what will benefit the project the most? And what can I realistically achieve in X time?” Because sometimes I have a crazy idea, but then I realize it’s not really that important, or it will take me weeks, and maybe a simpler thing that I can do in a few hours or days is better. I like to ship things, so I like to do small things that add value. I also think each of us has a different set of skills and preferences for what to work on."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "A lot of stuff comes from the community. Some others we realize when we are using the app as well. For me, those are the two main factors when thinking about new features or bug fixing."</p>
<h5>Have there been any user-suggested features that you found particularly intriguing or surprising? Has any 'one' feature of Heroic been implemented because of such a suggestion? Be it Discord, Reddit, or similar?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "Anything Windows-exclusive is most likely coming from a user suggestion. For example, the Fortnite-only features of the Epic API I've mentioned above: I have no interest in the game, but enough people were asking for them &amp; they weren't too hard to implement. Whipped up a Pull Request (for the non-nerds out here: a list of changes to Heroic), people reported it was working, and in it went."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "There’s a lot of ideas that come from users’ suggestions. Sometimes the suggestion may not fully fit into Heroic’s scope, but that may trigger other ideas too. I can’t remember one specifically, but one I want to implement that was suggested long ago (and I never find the time to do it) is to have the option to remap the gamepad buttons to other actions."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I can think of several that came from user suggestions. One thing was the ability to control Heroic with a joystick. It was a feature that people asked since the beginning, and then Ariel implemented it later on. The Windows and macOS versions also were suggested by users. GOG integration was asked like day one as well."</p>
<h5>What was the most challenging feature to implement and how did you overcome it?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I think the most challenging stuff I find are bugs that are really hard to solve… like… race conditions (we have a lot of things happening at the same time) or things the users don’t really see (like performance problems, dev-experience changes, and refactors, etc.). A lot of features sometimes look really challenging or complicated, but I usually end up feeling it was just my lack of knowledge of the topic. In the end, some things I struggled with ended up looking really simple."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I think making Proton work properly took time. At first, we did not have proper access to the docs, so we were just guessing and testing a lot. Today, Heroic has a pretty solid implementation, but it took a lot of time to reach that level of stability."​</p>
<h5>Personally, my favorite store-front is GOG. I love what they stand for and what they do for the gaming community. Have you had direct contact with GOG? Any insights? Have they given you any feedback? Even a throwaway comment?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio: </strong>"The guys from GOG are great, and they contacted me directly once to talk about Heroic, and they totally support the project and what we are doing, especially on Linux. I would say we have a really good relationship with them."</p>
<p>Paweł: "Adding to what Flavio said, we currently have the affiliate deal with GOG, so any purchases made using our link support the project financially."</p>
<h4>Community and Feedback</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>How has the community feedback shaped the development of Heroic Launcher? You guys have an ARDENT fan-base, and there's no better sign of a good product than a community who rally around what you built. Are your respective communities involved in some way in what comes with each release?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I think the best thing we get from the community for Heroic is a way to understand what’s important. Because we can have ideas and think of a random feature, but you never know if people will actually care about it… but having Discord and GitHub (those are the 2 places I check regularly) lets you see what’s going on, what’s bothering most people (latest example would be the GTAV problems, and that led us into doing more research around that problem). We can’t do everything that looks important, but it certainly helps a lot."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Just when I created the first POC of Heroic, I published about it on Reddit, and the comments were mostly favorable, but there were a lot of people that criticized at first because of being for Epic and using Electron like I said above. But nowadays, we have an amazing community. People don’t complain about that anymore. We have several friends in other communities as well, like Bottles, Vanilla OS, Lutris, Gaming on Linux, etc. People help each other, others refer to the project everywhere. There are tons of videos about it on Youtube and tutorials on several websites for gaming or not."</p>
<h5>How do you stay connected with the users and incorporate their feedback into the project?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I think having an active Discord and GitHub is good for those. We use a bit of Mastodon and X as well, but I think most of the ideas come from the first two."</p>
<h5>How important is the community to the success and growth of Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "It’s safe to say Heroic wouldn’t exist, or at least it wouldn’t be in its current form, without community feedback. It is invaluable to the growth of the project."</p>
<h5>​Discord and Reddit...are there any other places you have a community? Anywhere else people can follow along with Heroic?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I would consider GitHub also part of the community. A lot of suggestions/requests go directly there. I personally only read Discord and GitHub issues."</p>
<h4>Future Plans</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>What exciting new features or updates can users look forward to in the near future? I know a new release is coming up; have you anything you can share on that here with me?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "It’s hard to tell what’s going to happen in the near future because we don’t have a predefined roadmap. Also, there’s always new contributors that show up and add something we were not expecting (for example, the feature to add categories and assign games was a contribution and nobody on the core team was working on that). Personally, my main goals are: redesign, improving UX, and improving DX."</p>
<h5>Are there any long-term goals or visions you have for Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I think adding more stores, making playing games even easier to play without much tinkering. These are the main Heroic goals and mission."</p>
<h5>How do you see Heroic Launcher evolving in the next few years?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Be an alternative for EA and Ubisoft launchers on Linux and macOS would be pretty nice. But even if we have all the money and time, maybe not all of those are possible because of technical restrictions."</p>
<h5>How do you envision the future of game launchers in general? Handhelds in general?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I feel that people don't like to have too many launchers, so in the future I think companies like EA and others might kill their launcher and only publish on Steam, Epic, and GOG."</p>
<h5>I know EA is in your plans for the future, any inkling on how close you might be to making that happen?</h5>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "The project is being developed together with the team behind Battlefront II manager - Kyber. There are still a lot of features and challenges we need to tackle before we make it public. Give us a few more months; you won’t be disappointed."</p>
<h5>As a fan of AMA's with developers, can people look forward to something similar to that with Heroic at any stage? With any release? If you'd give us even a 'maybe' I know people would love to see that. Or I would anyway.</h5>
<p><strong>​​Flavio:</strong> "I honestly think it would be fun to do something like this."</p>
<h4>Technical Aspects</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Can you describe the tech stack behind Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis: </strong>"Heroic is, in its core, a website with superpowers. We're using Electron, which gives us access to the frankly huge Web ecosystem, a fine (to not start another language war) language to work in (TypeScript), and low-level control where we need it. Store backends are usually implemented with another binary coming with Heroic (Legendary for Epic Games, gogdl and Comet for GOG, Nile for Amazon) to make it easy for other game launchers to build upon our work."​</p>
<h5>What was the most technically challenging part of developing Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "Definitely publishing to all 3 major operating systems at once. Finding out that your cool new feature isn't working right because macOS uses an ancient version of some command-line utility is not for the faint of heart. Other than that, the (unsurprising) amount of variance between users always has to be dealt with. "Where do people mount their drives?" "What shell are they using?" and even "What language are they speaking?" all seem like obvious questions now, but they're sure to come back to bite you when you least expect it."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Making everything works as seamlessly as possible is the biggest challenge, in my opinion. Even though the heavy lifting is made on the wine/proton side, it still requires us to understand and test a lot of stuff. A few releases ago we added the automatic fixes with winetricks, and then we now have this repository on GitHub where we can use it to automate those. This is the biggest challenge: to make that one-click play work just fine on all Linux distros and macOS."​</p>
<h5>How do you handle compatibility issues across different operating systems? (which OS was the hardest?!)</h5>
<p><strong>Mathis:</strong> "We do have automated tests in place, but nothing beats the old "boot up Heroic on OS, test it". Because of that, as a Linux user, I'd say Linux is the easiest, followed by Windows (at least you can test in a VM), with macOS being the hardest (the only viable solution to testing on there being "Buy a Macbook"). Outside of Heroic itself, we heavily rely on Wine and its derivatives to run Windows programs. Its support is, of course, always improving, and I hope it'll take another big leap once UMU is supported."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I feel Linux is the easiest to work with, but I’m probably too biased. Windows would be second; at least when there’s a problem, you can find something on the internet. On Mac, it’s harder; the system is more closed."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I disagree with Ariel and Mathis. Windows is the easiest platform to deal with, simply because all games are native to it. So we don’t need to deal with a lot of settings and variables and commands like we do for Linux and Mac. Linux is second because the Wine and Proton are pretty mature there. macOS is improving now with Apple's Gaming Porting Toolkit, but it's still at least 2 years away from what Linux has achieved for gaming."</p>
<h5>Are there any third-party tools or libraries that have been particularly helpful?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "Weblate to solve the management of translation is great. Legendary/gogdl/nile are, of course, crucial."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I would say all those binaries like Legendary, GOGDL, and Nile, but also Proton, Wine-GE, Wine-Crossover, and GPTK from GCENX, UMU. I mean, even Electron is really important to make it so easy to distribute the package to all the platforms we support."</p>
<h5>How do you ensure the security and privacy of users' data within Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "No data is being shared anywhere by Heroic. The application only manages what is required for it to work, everything operates locally on the user's machine."</p>
<h4>Personal Insights</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>What’s everyone's favourite game to play using Heroic Launcher?</h5>
<p><strong>Paweł:</strong> "I absolutely love the world of Horizon Zero Dawn. Currently, I aim to unlock all of its achievements. Even though there is a whole New Game+ ahead of me, I can’t wait to get my hands on the sequel."</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I don’t have a favorite game (I raaarelly would play a game twice), and I don’t play online games."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I finished several games using Heroic already in these almost 4 years of development. My favourites were Blasphemous 2, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, and A Plague Tale: Innocence."</p>
<h5>How do you balance development work with your personal life? A lot of devs who build for gaming can find it hard to find the love or time for gaming sometimes. Do you guys struggle here?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I’m single and live alone, so I have a lot of time after work. But I don’t play games that much. I have weeks where I’d play some hours, but then that goes away, and I don’t touch a game for weeks or even months. But on the other hand, coding is my favorite hobby, and it requires less commitment (you can code a feature in a few hours, but some games require 50/60 hours once you start them), so I find it way easier to find time to code."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "I had some struggles and still have because I always needed to reconcile Heroic, a full-time job, and family, since I am married and have two kids. Good thing I don’t need to sleep much 😂"</p>
<h5>Are there any developers or projects in particular that inspire you?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Well, Heroic was inspired a lot by the Lutris project. I used Lutris for several years, and I still admire the project a lot. But the Wine Project, Linux itself, Steam. All those things, open source or not, had inspired me somehow as a gamer, developer, and Heroic dev."</p>
<h5>What advice would you give to aspiring developers who want to create their own software?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "Just… start something, the simplest prototype you can build. And if you don’t know where to start to create something new, start by contributing to something you use; you’ll learn a lot, and eventually, you’ll understand."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Yeah, starting the first thing might be harder, but once you start it and publish it somewhere, you feel nice, and then you want to improve or even start something new. Before Heroic, I published a couple of Android Apps, tried to build a Bitcoin Exchange on my own as well. All of those gave me experience, and I learned a lot from architecture until publishing, through the dev ops, sustainability, scalability, etc."</p>
<h5>What do you do to unwind and recharge after a long day of coding?</h5>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> "I watch some series or play sudoku or go play soccer. But since it’s my hobby, sometimes coding for Heroic feels like a way to recharge after my full-time work too."</p>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "Watch some TV shows and horror movies with my wife, play with my kids, or get the Steam Deck and play something there as well."</p>
<h5>Finally? Any closing words? Anything you'd like to say to the community-at-large?</h5>
<p><strong>Flavio:</strong> "A big thanks to everyone that supports us, all developers that contributed to the project, our friends on Discord, other friends' projects like Weblate, Bottles, Lutris, Gaming on Linux, The Linux Experiment, Vanilla OS, Garuda OS, SignPath, and many others. Everyone is part of the Heroic journey and is important in many different ways."</p>

      <title>Dance of Dragons is the latest major update for War Thunder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I just love to sink hours into flying around in various planes and getting muddy in tanks, War Thunder has a new major update out now with Dance of Dragons. <em>That grind though right? Sure does take forever.</em></p>
<p>What to expect from this latest update? You'll get numerous new vehicles, quality of life fixes and of course plenty of bug fixes too. Interestingly for this update one of the new planes (P-16) was made by two War Thunder players as part of their new "revenue share program" along with help from the Swiss Air Force Center in Dübendorf and the Swiss community.</p>
<p>No new location for this update but they did go back and update several existing locations and missions. Some sound tweaks like reduced distortion from ground crews, there's also a new muffled sound effect when a cockpit canopy is opened at high speeds to no longer give some players an advantage. You can now customize your tank sights and some big changes for helicopters. For helicopters there's a refined helicopter damage model, with the addition of avionic systems, weapons control, night vision devices, countermeasure systems and radar equipment modules.</p>

      <title>Mojang give an update on the future of Minecraft development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft is closing in on 15 years now, and so Mojang have given an update on where things stand and what their plans are for future development.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official blog post</a> it was mentioned that they're going to completely change future update drops. Instead of doing one major update a year, they're moving to "a number of free game drops throughout the year" that will vary in size but give new content more frequently.</p>
<p>Not just that but they're also looking at some "long-term initiatives" to allow Minecraft to continue evolving long into the future. Which could be interesting once we know more about what they're cooking up.</p>
<p>The Minecraft Live event is also going to change, finally retiring the mob vote and instead "bring you something new". Additionally, there will now be two events a year instead of one so we can get more regular updates about what they're actually doing.</p>
<p>All seems pretty positive to me. Minecraft fans have long hated the mob vote because lots of good choices for new additions just get thrown away. And more regular updates will be great too, as Minecraft has traditionally had a really slow release cycle for even small changes.</p>

      <title>The save Team Fortress 2 petition lands at Valve HQ with over 340,000 names</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember somewhat recently there <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/the-savetf2-campaign-to-get-valve-to-beat-the-team-fortress-2-bots-has-begun/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was a new campaign</a> to highlight bot issues in Team Fortress 2 (TF2)? This was part of the SaveTF2 petition, which gathered over 340,000 names and now it's at Valve's HQ.</p>
<p>Still to this day TF2 is one of the most popular Valve games, with it seeing a peak concurrent player count of 64,656 in the last 24 hours. That puts it in the top 20 most played games on Steam from all developers.</p>
<p>The creator of the petition website ("<a href="https://x.com/Thewhat89" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thewhat</a>") posted up on X / Twitter across the weekend, first <a href="https://x.com/Thewhat89/status/1832492588085002333" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showing off</a> a picture of the book actually inside Valve's offices:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12938213851725899824gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12938213851725899824gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In a later post they <a href="https://x.com/Thewhat89/status/1832533634068213999" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted up</a> a rather fancy video of the book noting (video in the link):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>340,000+ names all compiled into 1 book. This is a symbol of the astounding amount of people that love TF2 and want to see it flourish.</p>
<p>This book has now reached its destination at Valve HQ. The future is looking bright for TF2. Thanks for taking part, everyone ❤️</p>
<p>#FixTF2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/team-fortress-2-gets-a-summer-event-update-new-comic-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Summer Update</a> along with news about a comic, and various bot account bans that things are looking quite a lot better for TF2.</p>

      <title>The creator of Lutris has joined up with Playtron for PlaytronOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Playtron team working on PlaytronOS has grown recently, with the creator of the popular app Lutris joining up.</p>
<p>What is PlaytronOS? An upcoming specialised Fedora Silverblue based Linux distribution from Playtron. Designed to work with Steam, Epic Games, GOG and more. It's backed by the likes of Samsung, Square Enix, Circle &amp; Mysten Labs and is taking aim at both SteamOS from Valve and Windows from Microsoft to give a simple interface to get gaming on handheld PCs and more.</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/square-enix-invests-in-playtron-for-their-linux-based-playtronos-first-alpha-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alpha of PlaytronOS was just recently </a><a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/square-enix-invests-in-playtron-for-their-linux-based-playtronos-first-alpha-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> so they're actually beginning to show what they're doing.</p>
<p>Now, in a post on Patreon, Mathieu Comandon the creator of Lutris <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/playtron-ubuntu-111705494" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> how they're "Joining forces with Playtron". As Comandon explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a console like experience on Linux was something I’ve always wanted but building a full OS for Lutris was always out of scope given the effort required to maintain it. Maintaining the Lutris project is already quite a substantial load and we wouldn’t have the manpower to drive such a project. But with joining forces with other projects and getting support from investors that’s a whole different story. My plan was to find a job after the SCaLE expo, ending a period of only relying on savings and donations. I put aside the other prospects I had and got in touch with Playtron. A few weeks after, I was joining their team as a developer to work mostly on the UI side of things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post also briefly touches on some issues like PlaytronOS not currently supporting actual Native Linux games, and crypto/web3, which I touched on in previous articles too. The post also notes how like with SteamOS, the development of PlaytronOS "directly contributes to the evolution of several open source projects".</p>
<p>So now the Playtron team has developers from Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, ChimeraOS, winesapOS and Box64 to name just a few.</p>
<p>Lutris fans will also be happy to know a new release is "on the way" that will have "many fixes, notably for the Ubisoft integration" along with "better support for umu and Flatpak". More about Lutris can be seen on the <a href="https://lutris.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

      <title>Moon Watch is a time-stopping horde survival deck-builder from the devs of Backpack Hero</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the popular <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a>, Jaspel, have revealed their new game Moon Watch. Combining together elements of recent popular games like Vampire Survivors for the basic idea, but blending in deck-building too with the ability to stop time.</p>
<p>Looking at the trailer and the details, along with playing a bit of the demo myself, I'm already completely in love with the idea. I want more! With time that only moves when you move, plus the deck-building feature, it's far more strategic than other survivor-likes and seems like once again a small developer has done something really unique here that I'm going to end up playing for hours on end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R3Xmn6z98wk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8402de9f4ee4790634c6ba5b7eb4bd28.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R3Xmn6z98wk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Jasper Cole, the lead developer of a tiny team Jaspel, the game is a blend of inspirations: “We love Vampire Survivors and Slay the Spire, so combining them seemed like the natural thing to do. But we struggled with how to bring it all together until we looked at Superhot – that time-stop mechanic, where the world pauses when you stop moving, was the missing piece." Cole explains, "We’re curious to see if players like it and what we can improve, so we’re inviting everyone to give the demo a try."</p>
<p>“Jasper, Calvin, and Felix are quietly pushing the boundaries of indie gaming,” says Jakub Radkowski, CEO at Pretty Soon – the publisher behind Backpack Hero and Moon Watch. "With Backpack Hero, they invented a whole new genre – the inventory management roguelike. There was nothing like it before. The game sold really well and Jaspel could have easily made a sequel or something similar. But instead... they invented a new genre again. We're super excited that they came to us for a second time after our work together on Backpack Hero."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survive the Horde</strong> – Battle endless waves of enemies using your skills, time control, and tactics to outwit your foes.</li>
<li><strong>Sequential Flow</strong> – Move, stop, strategize, then act. Plan each move carefully, as freezing time opens up opportunities for devastating combos.</li>
<li><strong>Build Your Deck</strong> – Collect unique cards and relics, refining your deck to suit your strategy and playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Grow in Power</strong> – Unlock powerful abilities and items as you fight through the Vampire Lord’s stronghold with each run.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try out the free web demo on <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/moonwatch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck 2.3 Beta brings a new unified UI and multi language support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of emulation on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, you might want to give the new EmuDeck 2.3 Beta a spin. This new Beta was released September 8th, with the EmuDeck developers now looking for some feedback on how it runs. <em>In case you missed they also recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/emudeck-team-announce-linux-powered-emudeck-machines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the EmuDeck Machines</a>.</em></p>
<p>There's no full changelog of what's been doing yet other than the app having "a new unified UI and multi language support".</p>
<p>I've been giving it a spin today, and it seems to work quite well. The updated interface is quite a bit better, with proper categories for all the various settings and tweaks you can do. Here's a few shots of how it looks in the Beta on desktop Linux:</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers v3.9.4 gets save backups using Ludusavi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers has a new release out with version 3.9.4 bringing in Ludusavi, a tool that can help you backup your game saves.</p>
<p>This is the app that lets you easily install the likes of Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Humble Games Collection, IndieGala, itch.io, Rockstar Games, Ubisoft Connect and various others. It works on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck!</p>
<p>I wrote about Ludusavi <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/ludusavi-seems-like-a-pretty-good-open-source-game-save-backup-tool/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">way back in 2021</a>, and it it has only continued improving with many releases since then. Seems like a perfect fit for NonSteamLaunchers too!</p>
<p>Here's the latest <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.9.4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes in NonSteamLaunchers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feature Update for Desktop Version<br/>
~fixed some installs for Bazzite to work properly<br/>
~fixed Battle.net to install again<br/>
~added Ludusavi to be bundled with NSL, this program is very helpful to get your Game Saves back up and running on your Steam Deck, its automatically isntalled now in the Desktop Version and all of the your game saves are now saved here "/home/deck/NSLGameSaves" ive already added all the setup for you, so there is no need to do anything, every time you install a launcher the NSL script it will auto backup your games. Ive also created a backup of your ludusavi configuration files in case anything gets correupted or messed up in the same directory as ludusavi.</p>
<p>DECKY PLUGIN 1.0.1 (currently in the testing store)<br/>
~added HoYoPlay and RemotePlayWhatever to the Plugin that is in the testing store<br/>
~added more visual notifications for each game from every launcher for the scanner<br/>
~added more scanner fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer noted they're currently working on restoring saves automatically. And they mentioned this new feature also works well with the <a href="https://github.com/GedasFX/decky-cloud-save" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Cloud Save</a> plugin too that allows you to stick your saves in your preferred service online if you wish.</p>

      <title>DOOM + DOOM II enhanced versions get Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the upgraded enhanced releases of DOOM and DOOM II from Nightdive Studios and id Software are available, Valve have given it a fresh test to get it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-get-bundled-together-with-new-enhanced-versions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced back in August</a>, the new edition bundles the two games together with quite a number of upgrades and extras, and make them a lot nicer to play on modern platforms (without going through GZDoom and others). For people who just simply want to click play, it's great.</p>
<p>Previously, they were noted to be Unsupported. This was leftover from when the Steam package was just the original DOOM (Ultimate Doom). It's not clear why it was tagged as Unsupported to begin with though, since many reports showed it working well.</p>
<p>Anyway, now Valve have confirmed it's thankfully click and play on Steam Deck and the bundle is Steam Deck Verified as of September 8th.</p>

Although, they did refresh that model since then with the newer AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS (originally it had the 7840HS). Plus, buying this specific model helps directly support <a href="https://ev.kde.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KDE e.V.</a>, a registered non-profit organization that represents the KDE Project in legal and financial matters.</p>

      <title>Oxenfree is being completely removed from itch.io in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Night School Studio sent out an email to owners of Oxenfree on <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, to notify that it's going to be <em>completely</em> removed from the store on October 1st.</p>
<p>It's already been delisted and so the <a href="https://night-school-studio.itch.io/oxenfree" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store page</a> only shows up if you own it, which is what usually happens when developers / publishers properly move on, something we've seen a few times on Steam with various licensing issues. Usually though, it stays up for existing owners to download it.</p>
<p>Here, Night School Studio are <em>completely</em> removing it, so you <em>won't</em> be able to even download it from October 1st.</p>
<p>A few people sent this in but I've also been shared the email that was sent too (thanks, retrogunner):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19414037361725880413gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>No reason has actually been given as to why. Most likely, this is coming from Netflix, who actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/night-school-studio-creator-of-oxenfree-joins-netflix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired Night School Studio back in 2021</a>. Probably as they're trying to pull in more people to play games under their umbrella directly on Netflix.</p>

      <title>Wine 9.17 released with window surface scaling on High DPI displays</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Windows compatibility layer Wine version 9.17 is out now bringing new features and bug fixes so here's what's new.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> these are the main highlights:</p>

<li>Mono engine updated to version 9.3.0</li>
<li>Improved CPU detection on ARM64.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The vkd3d upgrade I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/wines-direct3d-to-vulkan-translation-library-vkd3d-113-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered previously</a> is now bundled as noted above that has these changes:</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/mono/wine-mono/-/releases/wine-mono-9.3.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono 9.3.0</a> also bundled has these changes:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>AMD&#39;s Z2 Extreme chip due out sometime in 2025 for handheld PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Things are about to get even more interesting for people interested in handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go as there's a new AMD chip coming.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/amd-ryzen-z1-series-announced-for-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-first-to-get-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced in April 2023</a>, the Z1 Extreme chip from AMD was tailor-made specially for handheld PC gaming. A pretty impressive bit of tech that launched initially in May 2023 with the ROG Ally and later the Lenovo Legion Go. Seems it was important and successful enough to get a next-generation upgrade.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-confirms-z2-extreme/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a> who attended a Q&amp;A session between AMD and Microsoft, AMD revealed there's going to be a Z2 Extreme chip due out sometime in "early 2025".</p>
<p>Better performance and battery life will hopefully be the focus, with Digital Trends noting "AMD’s Jack Huynh highlighted wanting to play <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>for three hours on a handheld, not the 45 minutes or so you can get on current handhelds".</p>
<p>With this coming next year, it might prove to be a good starting off point for the next-generation Steam Deck 2. We know that Valve will have been waiting on there being a good enough performance bump for a proper second system after the Steam Deck OLED, so perhaps this could be the one? Or, perhaps Valve will once again have something a little more custom, with the Z2 Extreme features forming the base of it.</p>
<p>I really can't wait to see more info on this. Really exciting to see the handheld PC gaming space keep improving.</p>

      <title>A classic returns - Gimmick! 2 from Bitwave Games is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original released back in 1992 for the Famicom (NES) and now Bitwave Games along with publisher Clear River Games have revived the classic platformer with Gimmick! 2 out now. Much like the recent Toaplan Arcade Shoot 'Em Up Collection from Bitwave Games, it also has Linux support too. Great to see another developer keep doing Linux games.</p>
<p>If you loved the golden era of platformers, and long for something similar, it seems like Gimmick! 2 will be a perfect fit for you. With tough platforming, charming visuals and a soundtrack from David Wise who has composed for games like Yooka-Laylee, Donkey Kong, Battletoads and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-QqtRjEhf2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a9ecdea8dda68882e986e295a846f56.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-QqtRjEhf2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Gimmick! 2, you once again meet the green little yokai Yumetaro. Decades after his first adventure he now sets out on a new quest in a world packed with interesting challenges, dangerous enemies, and hidden treasures. The game can be played in either a friendlier assisted mode, or if you’re up for a challenge play in the true-to-the-original “Gimmick!” mode!</p>
<p>As a yokai, Yumetaro has the ability to summon and throw a powerful star that not only bounces, but also keeps the momentum of his movement. The Star can be used to activate switches, defend against enemies and even be ridden to get to those hard-to-reach places while exploring the secrets of the world. You can discover treasure, find shortcuts or set speed records by mastering the star's bouncing physics. Experiment with it to unlock its full potential. This is a game with true star power!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994880/Gimmick_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Elecrow CrowView Note is a real useful all-in-one portable monitor and keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Elecrow sent over a review unit of their new CrowView Note, a portable all-in-one monitor and keyboard that you can use to turn various devices into a proper workstation.</p>
<p>There's a growing list of companies that make these, and this is the first one I've been able to actually get my hands on to try and I have to admit — I'm pretty impressed. That said, to be clear this is not a general device for everyone, it's a specialised device to fill a specific need you may have.</p>
<p>It looks <em>exactly</em> like a laptop but appearances are deceiving. You use it via an external system that could be: an Android phone, a Steam Deck or other handheld, console, a Raspberry Pi and anything else that can connect via USB-C or Mini HDMI. In other words it's a laptop without a brain to make it think, so — a Lapdock? Some of you may know of it from others like the NexDock, various models from UPERFECT and so on. This is a more budget-friendly option though, for those of you who want something that works well but doesn't have a high price-tag.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13227847031725622995gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13227847031725622995gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14511757091725623028gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14511757091725623028gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For my testing, I decided on the kind-of obvious thing. I turned my Steam Deck OLED into my workstation this week. I've been wanting to do this for ages, to use the Steam Deck as a desktop <em>properly</em> too and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. However, this article is to really just go over the CrowView Note. Using the Steam Deck for it is a happy bonus. The fun news, is that it connects up to the SteamOS-powered Steam Deck without a fuss. Although, it was a nice test for which of my USB-C cables are junk (turns out, a lot). Plug it in, and KDE Plasma pops up to ask how you wish to use the display and away you go. That's it. Not sure what anyone is really expecting there though, it's a fancy display, hub and keyboard all in one. It would be odd if it wasn't plug and play which it very much is.</p>
<p>In terms of look, style and quality it really does just look like a pretty standard laptop. Nothing fancy there. It feels a lot like many lower-end laptops do, for better or worse. Plastic and clearly not high-end, but it's <em>not</em> trying to be. It's perfectly functional, looks okay and for its purpose, you don't need any more than that. All the ports worked fine and were all lined up correctly, so I had no problems using it for lengthy periods of time.</p>
<p>The keyboard being the US layout was initially confusing being in the UK, but that's such a minor point. The keyboard is pretty standard too, it feels <em>okay</em> to type on but nothing special, and certainly no worse than most cheap laptops. Complete with quick function keys to adjust volume, brightness, media playback and to see the current battery level. The trackpad is just <em>fine</em> too and decently sized, with multi-touch support to scroll around along with hidden left/right buttons at the bottom. The touchpad appears to be detected as a mouse, no touchpad settings available in KDE Plasma for it.</p>
<p>It comes with a few helpful adapter bridge connectors too for plugging into a Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano and other similar single-board PCs. Nice little extra to see included.</p>
<p>The unit does have an OSD as well that allows you to adjust various display settings which is also quite useful to get it to whatever comfort level you need to work with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21178584731725623101gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21178584731725623101gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/813410021725623103gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/813410021725623103gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One slight let-down here is that there's no light indicator for when the unit is fully charged. It has one on the top that's lit up white when it's turned on, and a small red light by the DC connector when it's charging, but nothing to indicate fully charged on the review unit. I spoke to Elecrow about this and they said that the complete units sent out will "add a charging status indicator" so that's great.</p>
<p>The battery life on it is okay, nothing particularly special there. You'll get somewhere between 1-2 hours on a full charge (Elecrow said) depending on what you're doing. With my Steam Deck OLED plugged in, with the display on the CrowView Note set to 90/100 and music playing from the built-in speakers at 20/100 volume it managed a good 2 hours 40 minutes while constantly working away.</p>
<p>With a price of $169 outside of the Kickstarter (early bird on Kickstarter starts $129), to me that actually seems properly reasonable for what you get, especially compared with the competition.</p>
<p>So what do you actually get here? A 14" 1080p IPS 100% sRGB screen that's nicely bright for general work and play, a 5000mAh battery, with a full keyboard and trackpad, 2x 2W speakers, along with:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Left Side:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB-A</li>
<li>Mini HDMI</li>
<li>USB-C Power Supply (PD 5V/5A Output) - no video in</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Right Side:</p>
<ul>
<li>DC 3.5mm Power Supply (12V/4A Input) - comes with a power plug</li>
<li>USB-A</li>
<li>Headphone Jack</li>
<li>USB-C (5V/3A Output) - video in</li>
</ul>
<p>I think if I'm ever going to be using an extra device be it my RPi, Steam Deck or otherwise for a mixture of work and play — the CrowView Note is what I'm going to be using. It's going to find a permanent place on my living room table. And heck, paired up with a Steam Deck, it's more powerful and useful than my actual laptop and only a little bit less portable together.</p>
<p>Perhaps next time you're looking for some sort of dock, or a hub or just <em>something</em> to pair up with other devices, you may want to take a look at the CrowView Note. If you have multiple devices you switch around a fair bit, this could easily be a great addition to your tech shelf.</p>
<p>The CrowView Note is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elecrow/crowview-note-empowering-your-device-as-a-laptop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a> with the goal met. You can also see more on <a href="https://www.elecrow.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their website</a>. Shipping should begin in October 2024.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in the very far future, a time where we've conquered the stars, Year Unknown is a story-focused exploration game about finding purpose.</p>
<p>With visuals and a story inspired by works such as BLAME! and Naissancee, the developer mentioned that it was developed on Linux with almost all open source tools. Just recently they announced a release date of October 7th and you can check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rQ65KTsCOY0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/202a3216bd379de2569a79d3a0854e3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rQ65KTsCOY0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A story-based exploration game about the very far future, after humanity spreads across the stars, achieves peace, and finds a way to preserve the universe forever. With the help of two Artificial Intelligences, explore the conquered universe and uncover your purpose in it.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>The universe has been turned into a database of humanity's knowledge, art, and ideas. You wake up in this universe, with your only companions being two Artificial Intelligences who help you understand the data in it.</p>
<p>But something else is calling you: a distress call from the center of the universe. The stagnant universe is breaking down, and there may be no way to save it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, the developer also mentioned how after release they "plan to open source it and turn some parts into useful addons".</p>
<p>You can follow it and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2565520/Year_Unknown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try the demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Parking Garage Rally Circuit releases September 20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to destroy some tyres? Parking Garage Rally Circuit from Walaber Entertainment has announced a release date for September 20. A love letter to retro racers and in particular the Sega Saturn, presented like a lost Sega Saturn game, this is one for fans of the proper classics.</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lcxRmvn8KXY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ed0fa1ee4af04797f6541af58162acc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lcxRmvn8KXY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retro Arcade-style Rally Racing in repurposed Parking Garages in big cities across the USA</p>
<ul>
<li>You said "Parking Garage"? The “Parking Garage Rally Circuit” tour comes into a city, selects a parking garage, and temporarily turns it into an exciting rally course for a week-long competition. Each track in the game is styled as a unique parking garage that has been turned into a race course.</li>
<li>Rally... Circuit?!? This is a hybrid of Rally and circuit racing. From rally it draws the jumps and “one racer at a time against the clock” time-trial format. However, the tracks are similar to circuit racing, with each race consisting of multiple laps around the same track (the track may change slightly from lap to lap, however) Controls are very tight, simple and arcadey, similar to Mario Kart (accelerate, reverse, steer, drift), but with a bit more dynamic “smash into things” physics.</li>
<li>Seamless Leaderboards - After beating the gold trophy for a course, ghosts from other players just barely ahead of you on the leaderboard are automatically downloaded to race against, getting you into that "just one more" flow as you chase down rivals. Limiting the auto-download rivals to Steam friends only is also an option.</li>
<li>Realtime Multiplayer - Create or join a lobby of up to 8 players for realtime peer-to-peer non-contact racing!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 patch 1.7 is out now with a mod manager, modding toolkit and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian Studios still aren't yet finished with Baldur's Gate 3 seeing a huge new update out now, with a few more patches still to come. The developer said that more patches to come will add "both crossplay and photo mode, alongside other fixes and updates" which sounds exciting to bring platforms together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This massive update to the game though adds in plenty for evil players with 13 new cinematics that offer varying conclusions to your most evil playthroughs. The biggest addition is their in-game Mod Manager and a new modding toolkit to download on Steam. So it has official modding support now, making it a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Larian said that mods made via their own toolkit can be uploaded to the game, so people can browse and install them directly in the game itself. On top of that the game now officially supports " some scripted mods using Osiris, our in-house scripting language". So mod creators can reload their own scripts, handle build errors, and also carry out basic debugging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12018747831725558545gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12018747831725558545gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - the in-game Mod Manager</em></p>
<p>They also revamped split-screen to have both sides dynamically merge together when characters are close, and split dynamically when you move apart along with various other improvements to split-screen.</p>
<p>Lots more has changed, including thankfully some performance improvements. The developer said there's been plenty of "performance and stability optimisations across the game" and in particular optimised performance for areas with lots of NPCs like Lower City.</p>
<p>And of course lots and lots more in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Seems like it might finally be time for me to actually go and complete it properly. Or maybe start again, because I've completely forgotten what I was doing. There's too many good games to play.</p>
<p><em>Baldur's Gate 3 is rated Steam Deck Verified and Gold on ProtonDB.</em></p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-13 released bringing in a fix for World of Warcraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Only a few days after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/ge-proton-9-12-released-with-fixes-for-star-citizen-bully-scholarship-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-12 was released</a>, GE-Proton 9-13 is out now with a fix for World of Warcraft along with upstream code updates.</p>
<p>As your reminder: it's a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-13" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-13</a> release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton to latest git to include World of Warcraft MSAA fix</li>
</ul>
<p>proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>proton upstream fixes added</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional:</p>
<ul>
<li>protonfixes updated to latest git</li>
</ul>

<p>You can install GE-Proton with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/protonup-qt-v2102-adds-support-for-the-winezgui-launcher-and-old-compatibility-tools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>.</p>
<p>For those of you reading who regularly play WoW on Linux with Wine / Proton, how's the experience nowadays? It's been a very long time since I tried, but I remember even years before Proton is mostly ran quite well.</p>

      <title>Black &amp; White (2001) open source game engine sees a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black &amp; White from Lionhead Studios released originally back in 2001 went on to great reviews, and won various awards. Sadly, it's one game that has also been lost to time but the openblack project plans to revive it with open source.</p>
<p>I originally covered this project way <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/09/openblack-is-a-foss-game-engine-for-black-white-currently-under-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2019</a>, and it seems it's come a long way since then, although still heavily under development. Yesterday, September 4th, the openblack project had a first actual release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15735906891725572224gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features implemented:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Camera movement system which matches Black &amp; White.</li>
<li>Landscape with higher resolution thanks to intermediate rendering of the landscape texture.</li>
<li>Model rendering and animation.</li>
<li>Morphable mesh rendering.</li>
<li>Audio support.</li>
<li>Dynamic sky controls.</li>
<li>Pathfinding for villagers.</li>
<li>Physics using bullet physics.</li>
<li>Early AI state machine.</li>
<li>The LHVM virtual machine is integrated and reverse engineered.</li>
<li>Runs on modern Windows, MacOS and Linux.</li>
<li>Experimental Android, iOS, web assembly support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some known issues like some colours being off and no launcher or global configuration options, so you need to launch it with command line arguments to find the assets. All of this of course will be improved as the project matures.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/openblack/openblack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You need a copy of the original game to run it which sadly is not easily available since Lionhead Studios no longer exist and the publisher Electronic Arts hasn't put it up anywhere.</p>

      <title>Try the refreshed demo of Pest Apocalypse a pizza-delivery survivor-like bullet heaven</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pest Apocalypse continues looking great. One I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/try-the-demo-for-pest-apocalypse-a-horde-survival-game-where-you-deliver-pizza-in-a-van/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlighted before</a> and doing so again now due to a brand new demo, bringing vehicular action to the survivor-like bullet hell genre. <em>The update comes as part of the Games from Croatia event on Steam.</em></p>
<p>Similar in basic theme to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/earl-vs-the-mutants-is-choatic-survivor-like-fun-with-vehicles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl vs. the Mutants </a>that I also recently covered, except this has you deliver pizza in the apocalypse and it's total chaos. Plus it has Native Linux support made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>. The demo update includes "a massive amount of early game changes, a whole new map to help you learn the basics of the game, additional gameplay settings to help tweak your experience, and a whole truckload of graphical updates to improve your pixel-to-eyeball experience".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6762107751725543026gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6762107751725543026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHORT BURSTS OF FUN</strong>: Quick runs that take ~12 minutes to complete!</li>
<li><strong>PIZZA DELIVERY SURVIVAL</strong>: There is more to this than just surviving, you have a job to do!</li>
<li><strong>VEHICULAR PLAYGROUND</strong>: Physics-based simulation for the best driving feel and fun!</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOMIZATION</strong>: Try various combinations of vehicles, survivors and modifications! Adapt and experiment to find what works best for the situation at hand!</li>
<li><strong>PEST CONTROL</strong>: Feel powerful as you slaughter an endless horde of disgusting pests!</li>
<li><strong>PROGRESSION</strong>: Use your in-game earnings to unlock new vehicles, weapons and more!</li>
<li><strong>2D + 3D</strong>: The charm of pixelated 2D sprites in a low poly 3D environment!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you're going to really like this one. It has the crazy upgrades and level-up system made popular by Vampire Survivors, really properly tuning it for vehicle-focused action while giving you a constant quest to pick up and deliver pizza that makes it feel like nothing else. Great fun.</p>

      <title>Get lost in a huge castle in the 2.5D metroidvania &#39;The Throne&#39; on September 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming with Native Linux support on September 30th is The Throne, a 2.5D styled metroidvania from BeByte. The developer already sent over a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>, so I'll be taking a look shortly and will have more to say closer to release.</p>
<p>More about it: "The Throne is a medieval adventure in the purest metroidvania style, with 2.5D pixel art aesthetics, in which you will have to liberate the kingdom taken by the terrible orc leader Bodrak. Follow the hero Eder through the labyrinthine castle and thrilling landscapes in search of the key to the throne room. Will you be able to save the kingdom?"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DY-LHmLKGZg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96fceb6d824aa7095f490c28ccffaf6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DY-LHmLKGZg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Navigate through intricate paths and dangerous traps set by orcs throughout all the game's areas. Test your skill and control to overcome all the obstacles that stand in your way. Each area is unique, and you will need to adapt your playstyle to each one.</li>
<li>Obtain powerful equipment from enemies. Farm repeatedly to acquire stronger weapons that will give you the power to defeat increasingly larger and more fearsome foes.</li>
<li>Recover Eder's magical equipment that will allow him to face the most terrible threats. The path becomes increasingly intricate, and your new abilities will open up routes you never imagined, revealing entirely new areas filled with content.</li>
<li>The castle is ancient and intricate, filled with labyrinthine passageways and dark dungeons that will give you the opportunity to explore and get to know every corner of each area in detail. Light your torch and arm yourself with courage.</li>
<li>Free the prisoners of the castle who will be hidden throughout the environment to obtain valuable rewards.</li>
<li>Calm reigned in the castle, devoid of its army to support an upcoming naval battle when Gabón, the legendary commander of the royal guard, betrays his own to let in the powerful and evil Bodrak. Together with his army of orcs, he manages to take the castle. Now it is only up to Eder to restore peace.</li>

      <title>Paradox are bundling four DLCs into Europa Universalis IV free for all players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This sounds like a nice move by Paradox to improve Europa Universalis IV. In October, four DLC packs will be bundled free with the game for all players.</p>
<p>You can't really go anywhere that a Paradox game is mentioned, without someone mentioning the often overwhelming number of DLC. So it's nice to see a move like this. Europa Universalis IV for example on Steam has 37 DLC, although a few are free.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> Paradox mentioned "Rights of Man", "Art of War", “Digital Extreme Upgrade” and "Common Sense" will be free of charge as of October 17. Everyone who already purchased the game will get them free of charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13567742291725534730gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13567742291725534730gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - screenshot from Europa Universalis IV: Art of War</em></p>
<p>As for why they're doing this? They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Europa Universalis IV has been with us for over a decade now (time flies!) - and during this time we continuously supported it with hundreds of free updates and dozens of DLCs. Over the years, it has become apparent that "Rights of Man", "Art of War", “Digital Extreme Upgrade” and "Common Sense" are the go-to choice for new players, while most veterans consider these DLCs to be an integral part of EUIV experience. It’s about time for us to recognize that officially - and make sure that both newcomers and experienced leaders can enjoy Europa Universalis IV equally from the get go. And is there a better way to do that than giving out these DLCs for free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, one issue is that they will end up breaking saves for your current campaigns if you didn't already own them. Which is why they're giving the notice period on this, allowing people to finish up their current games.</p>
<p>The DLC together will add quite a lot of content and gameplay features into the game, so this really is an unexpected and extremely welcome move for the future of the game. Fantastic.</p>

      <title>Historic multiplayer shooter Holdfast: Nations At War gets Steam Deck Verified after updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set during the Napoleonic Era and WW1, Holdfast: Nations At War blends together both a third and first-person shooter. And, after a bunch of upgrades, it's now Steam Deck Verified too. This means it will also run great on desktop Linux, thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p><em>The main game is set during the Napoleonic Wars, with a free total-conversion DLC set during WW1 that released two years after.</em></p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/589290/announcements/detail/4584188879496362998" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam at the end of August the developers noted how it became Steam Deck Verified. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of our efforts to bring Holdfast into the new age, a portion of the team has been hard at work not only making Holdfast accessible for those who prefer to play with a controller but also gaining the verification and official support for the Steam Deck console.</p>
<p>Development with the Steam Deck was pleasantly straightforward and a lot of the game worked with little to no intervention. With a few touch ups and thanks to the Steam Deck's powerful hardware and brilliant design, it happily runs Holdfast and it's shenanigans with great graphical fidelity and at an impressive frame rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going over previous updates they worked on full controller support, general input improvements, UI scaling and other smaller fixes to get it working nicely.</p>
<p>A big update is also coming soon for the game introducing new battlefields, a rework of existing maps and various quality of life improvements.</p>

      <title>Exographer is a metroidvania inspired by real science - will be fully Steam Deck playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developers SciFunGames have posted an update about their upcoming metroidvania Exographer, noting how well it runs on the Steam Deck. <em>They have no official rating from Valve yet but that's not stopping them.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2834320/announcements/detail/4611210477274034301" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they noted that it's "fully compatible with the Steam device" with "all the original game's features, controls, text and resolution adapted" and it's fully optimized for the Steam Deck and once verification is done they expect it to be 100% Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>So what's all this science stuff about? The developer explained how it was "imagined by science-fiction author and physicist Raphaël Granier De Cassagnac" with the puzzle solving based on the discovery of elementary particles. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d5pBIbHo0j0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6c24e74461d01d6fccb156c9e1e568a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d5pBIbHo0j0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A 2D metroidvania adventure based on exploration, puzzles and platforming.</li>
<li>Science based powers, narrative and puzzles.</li>
<li>Discover traces of an ancient civilization on an alien planetoid.</li>
<li>Overcome obstacles using and combining 4 powers: Gluon Boots, Photon Sphere, Wedic Waves and Zediacal Boxes.</li>
<li>6 different atmospheres, 20 levels, 9 scientists and 139 hidden pictures to reveal. Find 17 pixules (corresponding to real elementary particles).</li>
<li>15 hours of gameplay</li>
<li>Soundtrack composed by Yann Van Der Cruyssen (Stray, Cave Story).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it will work great on Steam Deck that's again good news for desktop Linux players since it will work via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Looks like a good one to pop onto your wishlist.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2834320/Exographer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> with a release due September 26th.</p>

      <title>Popular ARPG &#39;Last Epoch&#39; to get Steam Deck Verified with a big update on September 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch from Eleventh Hour Games is set for a big v1.1 update with The Imperial Uprising event arriving on September 19th. This will also bump it up to Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>While it does have a Native Linux version, the current Playable rating for Steam Deck was done with Proton. Valve noted it has some controller issues, along with some in-game text being too small.</p>
<p>In an update posted August 30th the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/4614588176979677054" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fans of the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and other handheld devices rejoice! As we continue to improve the overall experience for controller play, it naturally comes about that support for handheld devices is right around the corner. We are excited to announce that on September 19th, Last Epoch will be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a smaller update landed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/4590944913258535989" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today</a> that already brings in some controller improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Turning is now allowed while casting skills, even if you cannot move, by pointing the left stick to the direction you want to turn.</li>
<li>When using a controller the Radial Menu now opens when pressing the assigned button once, instead of holding the button. It can be closed by pressing the button again.</li>
<li>Fixed Sanctuary of Eterra UI Panel not working with controllers.</li>
<li>Opening the Inventory on controller now highlights the last active location.</li>
<li>Added fixes for navigating the factions UI while using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed collision issues when navigating the Shattered Road.</li>
<li>Improved map panning with controller. Map will now pan slower when zoomed in and faster when zoomed out. No change at default zoom level.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1.1 update comes along with The Imperial Uprising event which runs through until October 20th, which is the "first Cycle Event" which brings a Cycle Refresh and puts previous characters into a Legacy Cycle along with a Ladder reset, a bazaar reset and a fresh economy will start which many players have requested due to various issues from the launch of the game. At the same time there will be a 20% discount on all editions of the game.</p>
<p>Some of what's to come in the 1.1 update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Steam Deck Verification &amp; Improvements.<br/>
- New and Updated Shrines.<br/>
- Quality of Life Improvements to Dungeons.<br/>
- Loot Lizard Encounters.<br/>
- Stash Tab Priority System.<br/>
- Improvements to Bazaar Search.<br/>
- Month-Long Event Modifiers.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky adds fishing, a fishing skiff, a new expedition, deep-sea diving and loads more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can someone tell Hello Games it's all good now, everyone is over the poor launch? Actually don't, I want to see just how far they will keep pushing No Man's Sky. The latest update is a goodie too.</p>
<p>The just launched Aquarius Update is the perfect addition after the big water overhaul in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-is-out-now-and-drastically-transforms-the-planets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worlds Part I</a> bringing with it a whole lot of little bits of fun. Some of what's been added includes fishing, a fishing skiff, messages in bottles, a fishing expedition, a new diving suit, fish traps, new cooking recipes, a deep-water jetpack, a huge new fish variety and more.</p>
<p>Speaking about the update the developer said: "Something people really loved in the Worlds update was the new water technology – tons of players were posting videos of themselves just chilling at the water’s edge. One piece of fan art in particular stopped us in our tracks, of a player lazily fishing from their wing of their starship. This art, and others like it, was right at the heart of the inspiration behind the Aquarius update."</p>
<p>Once again, they say more will follow, so they're clearly not done with No Man's Sky just yet.</p>

      <title>Ember is a huge online tabletop RPG from the creators of Foundry Virtual Tabletop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop is a popular (and Linux-supported) modern online role-playing system and now the creators are working on a massive new game called Ember. Ember will use Foundry Virtual Tabletop, so it will work on Linux.</p>
<p>It sounds really ridiculously impressive too, a lot of which due to the work they've already done inside Foundry Virtual Tabletop. They've been working to build this up since 2022 and so the scope of it really is massive, complete with an original setting and a lengthy campaign.</p>
<p>What is it: "Ember is an online tabletop roleplaying game which is a hybrid between a tabletop RPG and a multiplayer digital game. It has all the elements of a traditional pen &amp; paper RPG but is enhanced with features inspired by video games to create a compelling hybrid of dynamic gameplay and a classical foundation. It is a collaborative storytelling experience for a gamemaster and group of players. Ember has been made specifically to be played online in Foundry Virtual Tabletop and has a ton of additional features, systems, and mechanics to facilitate and enhance gameplay."</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epic main story with years of gameplay.</li>
<li>Colossal open world of over 25,000 hexes.</li>
<li>Elegant character creation process.</li>
<li>Over 80 interactive and animated area maps.</li>
<li>Vista system for visual storytelling.</li>
<li>Codex to chronicle your achievements.</li>
<li>Dynamic and cinematic audio engine.</li>

<li>Solar, lunar, and seasonal calendar system.</li>
<li>Non-linear quests and consequential choices.</li>
<li>Token maker with infinite variation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foundryvtt/ember-rpg/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, and has absolutely smashed the initial goal with a current funding level of around £142,367. Clearly, virtual tabletop RPG experiences are popular then.</p>

      <title>Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini will have Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it has yet to have a proper full announcement, the Retroid Pocket 5 sounds like a nice device for those of you who love retro gaming and for the first time it will have proper Linux support too. Along with the Retroid Pocket Mini too.</p>
<p>As confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1831275010817671369" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the official account on X / Twitter, they posted this image:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11286750001725458447gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11286750001725458447gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The image notes it will have official support for Batocera and Armbian, with an "open Linux kernel for community developers".</p>
<p>Details they have revealed about it so far include a 5.5" 1080p AMOLED 16:9 screen, with DisplayPort 1080p 60Hz, a 5000mAh battery and it's size is said to be 19.9*7.8*1.56cm. With a weight of 280g too so. Looking at the previous version, it's not too much bigger than the Retroid Pocket 4 but clearly an upgrade. Going from the pictures and teaser videos the thumbsticks will have some form of lighting as well.</p>
<p>We also know it will be available in a few different colours, along with a customizable back shell for DIY options:</p>

<p>They've been teasing it for only a couple of days, so hopefully a full announcement isn't too far off, but it's really nice to see more hardware vendors look to get Linux working nicely on their devices. Going by another social media <a href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1831176401258447077" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> it will have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865.</p>
<p>It's not just the Retroid Pocket 5 that will have Linux support though, the also recently revealed Retroid Pocket Mini should also have Linux support as they <a href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1831290998963441777" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a reply to someone. Since they're using the same chipset, that's not too surprising.</p>
<p>See more about their devices on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their store</a>.</p>
<p><em>Looks like another company I'll have to keep a closer eye on.</em></p>

      <title>Acer enter the handheld PC gaming race with the Nitro Blaze 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again. Another vendor has decided to make their own PC gaming handheld and this time it's Acer with the Nitro Blaze 7.</p>
<p>It is once again using Windows, as most vendors shy away from Linux still apart from Valve with the SteamOS-powered Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/manjaro-linux-devs-show-off-the-orangepi-neo-prototype-handheld-with-gameplay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OrangePi Neo with Manjaro</a>. And again, it's another hardware vendor attempting to deal with the mess that is Windows with their own "Acer Game Space app".</p>
<p>With an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, AMD Radeon 780M Graphics and a 1080p 144 Hz refresh rate FreeSync IPS touch panel it sounds like a pretty nice unit overall. However with no trackpads and no back buttons, I imagine plenty will be writing it off for something else already.</p>

<p><em>Note: their official press release says 39 AI TOPS, but AMD's own specifications for the processor say 38 AI TOPS as does Acer's product page. So I assume Acer had an error in the press release specifications.</em></p>
<p>There's no price, region availability or release date being shared just yet. They're jumping into a still quite small market against the Steam Deck LCD and Steam Deck OLED, ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go, ZOTAC Zone, various devices from AYANEO, GPD and others I've forgotten. It's a crowded market already.</p>
<p>Apart from being just another handheld, I'm not really seeing anything to make it properly stand out. It's going to need a seriously competitive price considering the competition.</p>
<p>The question is: how long will it be from release to Linux working on it? We have many great Linux distributions designed for handhelds now including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=HoloISO&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HoloISO</a> and the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steamfork-is-yet-another-linux-distribution-aiming-to-be-a-steamos-like-for-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamFork</a>.</p>

      <title>Earl vs. the Mutants is chaotic survivor-like fun with vehicles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a whole lot of Vampire Survivor-likes and bullet hell / bullet heaven mixtures around, but not many stick you directly in the driver's seat like Earl vs. the Mutants. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Another super-cheap bit of happiness you can pick up here at only £2.49, you can't really go wrong with it if you love repeating runs where you build up a ridiculously overpowered character. Or, in this case, vehicle. Thanks to you being behind the wheel, the pace of it is many times quicker than other games in the genre, and for some that might be a great thing. You're speedy and reasonable powerful right from the start, so the action is speedy and satisfying right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3488114081725448871gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3488114081725448871gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's in a proper 3D from a top-down perspective, and you have wheels, you can actually properly use the terrain to your advantage here. Boosting over hills and smashing down into the hordes never gets old. Although, I will admit some slight disappointment that you can just drive through trees, it would have been more entertaining to accidentally wrap your car around a tree when fleeing the hordes as your turrets shoot around you.</p>
<p>There's two different control modes depending on how you wish to play. Twin-stick for easier gamepad use, and a more traditional mode for keyboard and mouse. You can set your weapons to auto-fire too, or manually control them to focus-fire on particular enemies so really you play it how you want.</p>
<p>Lots of upgrades are possible too. During runs you get per-level upgrades where you can pick various stat boosts, which are all random and sometimes you get some truly over-powered stuff. One run I remember gave me HP constantly for running over enemies, as well as driving fast, so I was basically god-like in car form. That was, until it started throwing bullet-sponge enemies at me, walking bombs (big ouch) and all sorts firing things at me to dodge which isn't particularly easy when you're boosting around in a vehicle.</p>
<p>The old lady boss likes to drop down extras for you too, like drones to follow you, new weapons and more. And thanks to the meta-progression, you can keep upgrading basic stats even when you fail.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NcL3ACnYQj8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac0e53ba62ca5a3acd0ae35774e5ef2a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NcL3ACnYQj8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've played a lot of these games now where you <s>run</s> drive around, smash through whatever weird types of enemies it decides to throw at you, collect gems and level up eventually becoming pretty much unstoppable. As far as Earl vs. the Mutants goes, it does exactly what's advertised and for that price you really can't argue on the value of it.</p>
<p>Nice short runs too at 5-10 minutes per level, so no sweat in you don't have a lot of free time.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2292010/Earl_vs_the_Mutants/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It runs perfectly on Linux with Proton 9. It has no Steam Deck rating from Valve yet but works fine.</p>

      <title>SteamFork is yet another Linux distribution aiming to be a SteamOS-like for handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Attack of the clones! Well, sort of anyway. We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=HoloISO&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HoloISO</a> and now SteamFork as well. There's so much choice to get Linux on your handhelds.</p>
<p>Much like traditional Linux distributions aimed at the desktop where there's hundreds of different versions, the same is beginning to happen for those targeting handheld gaming PCs now too.</p>
<p>So why another? Well, SteamFork "is intended to be as close to 1:1 compatible with upstream SteamOS as possible" while making changes to expand the hardware support. So it's not trying to add in tons of extras like Bazzite for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9921234441725445494gol1.png"/></p>
<p>As the developer explained when sending it in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a SteamOS based distribution that is intended to be as close to 1:1 compatible with upstream SteamOS as possible while making changes to support a wider range of hardware. It originated as a fork of HoloISO but it has been majorly overhauled to eliminate things like post-copy operations (as much as possible), introduce our own signed package repositories, add an automated release process, and provide many bug fixes and refinements. The focus has largely been on handheld gaming consoles, but it's in use on a variety of AMD based mini PCs as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full SteamOS UI/UX, including desktop mode.</li>
<li>Minimal changes to SteamOS to preserve upstream compatibility.</li>
<li>Power management optimizations ported from <a href="https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">JustEnoughLinuxOS</a>.</li>
<li>Improved fan curves on supported devices.</li>
<li>RGB off by default, will flash on low battery (on supported devices).</li>
<li>Supports booting from removable media such as usb drives and micro sd cards (64GB minimum).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Devour famous paintings in the classic Snake-ish game ART for Snakes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic game Snake? Well this is ART for Snakes, a "snake-ish" game about eating the most expensive paintings you can before the time runs out. <em>Disclosure: one of the team is a previous contributor to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you use snake-like controls to move through and leap from painting to painting across a branching 4 course campaign. Originally created as a prototype during a Game Jam, a big 1.0 update was released a few days ago turning it into a full game and expanding basically everything.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uEHSG49Isgo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3d772a8c8917aa4ca959b53771686d80.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uEHSG49Isgo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's free, so might be a nice little casual one to check out on your next coffee break. Mastering the controls on this one is actually a little challenging. There's something weirdly satisfying about munching on paintings across the various galleries.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://splerp.itch.io/art-for-snakes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>
