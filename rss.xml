      <title>JSAUX makes more Steam Deck backplate colours available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to give your Steam Deck a bit more colour and customization? The new coloured translucent backplates from JSAUX are <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106?variant=43781193269468" target="_blank">available</a> to order.</p>
<p>They're now available in: Brown, Purple, Blue, Green and Red at $29.99 with a Crystal (Clear) version coming sometime later. They're also offering a discount to people who already picked up the original Brown version. All of them come with a set of buttons you can pick from, anti-static finger gloves, screws, a screwdriver and a stick to help you get the backplate off.</p>
<p>This and a whole lot more, including a first-look at the backplate they sent me, is in my below news round-up video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LetMI8G3tcE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85ee7b5d92dc1e125c7fd7dc1ef271ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LetMI8G3tcE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The backplate does look great but the metal pad on it does get very warm. If you want it to properly reduce temperatures other than the real small amount it does by itself, it really would need something additional on top of it to keep pulling the heat away. Still, seems really nice overall. Would be interesting if they eventually did a version without the metal plate on the back and a frontplate too.</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to their PR team to see if I will be getting the other colours to take a look at too.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA 530.30.02 mainline Beta driver rolls out, plus a new Vulkan Beta driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released two new Beta drivers for Linux recently, so here's your usual rundown of what's new and changed.</p>
<p>First up is the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/200095/en-uk" target="_blank">Beta 530.30.02</a>, which is for their normal mainline consumer drivers. Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.<br/>
This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Linux kernels with Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA <em>also</em> just recently released the Vulkan <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Beta 525.47.11</a> for <em>developers</em> that includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with line stipple pattern when line stipple enable is dynamic.</li>
<li>Vulkan Video fixes:
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue where the driver is incorrectly padded in-place the API provided bitstream buffer when the size of the buffer is smaller than 16 bytes.</li>
<li>Fix an h.264 encoder bug with handling IDR pictures when the coded picture resolution changes.</li>
<li>Fix an issue where in some session configuration cases an incorrect size is being reported for the required memory heap for the h.264 encoder session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That extension noted above was worked on by people from Valve, Igalia, Google and NVIDIA and it's described as allowing "creating 3D views of 3D images such that the views contain a subset of the slices in the image, using a Z offset and range, for the purpose of using the views as storage image descriptors. This matches functionality in D3D12 and is primarily intended to support D3D12 emulation" — so it's another that was created to help the likes of Proton.</p>

      <title>Collabora announce &#39;Mercury&#39; hand-tracking for open source XR runtime Monado</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After working on it for a while, Collabora developer Moses Turner has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/monados-mercury-hand-tracking-now-ready-for-use.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that their "Mercury" hand-tracking for Monado, their open source XR runtime, is now ready for use.</p>
<p>Since it's been a while after last talking about Monado: "Monado is an open source XR runtime delivering immersive experiences such as VR and AR on mobile, PC/desktop, and other devices. Monado aims to be a complete and conformant implementation of the OpenXR API made by Khronos. The project is currently being developed for GNU/Linux and aims to support other operating systems such as Windows in the near future."</p>
<p>Work on the hand-tracking system has been going for over a year, and now ready for public use. Currently it works on the Valve Index, Windows Mixed Reality headsets (Reverb G2 v2 video below), Oculus Rift S (early support), and Luxonis cameras (video shows a OAK-D Pro W Dev mounted on a North Star). They said it "estimates hand pose accurately, supports limited hand-over-hand interactions, tracks fast hand movements, and is useable for drawing, typing and UI interaction".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dwJLUOj27eI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88a5dec1ffad33e4f7ddb858e206f773.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dwJLUOj27eI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Makes me continue to wonder if Valve will be using Monado for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/looks-like-valve-are-gearing-up-for-a-new-vr-headset/" target="_blank">long rumoured Deckard VR HMD</a>.</p>

      <title>Paradox plan announcements next week, like a new game from Cities Skylines dev</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced that on Monday, March 6th they will be announcing a whole bunch of new games and expansions.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously excited as they said it will include new games from Harebrained Schemes (Shadowrun / BATTLETECH), Colossal Order (Cities Skylines) and Paradox Tectonic (led by industry veteran Rod Humble). Not just that there will also be new expansions for existing games, free updates and news from their own Paradox Arc publishing initiative.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HCbJZqnuNYg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ca49cb654a786421aa04c32f81798c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HCbJZqnuNYg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say we have too many announcements, but it’s hard to choose which one has me most thrilled,” said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive. “Talking directly with our players about our games, sharing their excitement for what’s coming next, comparing how many hours we’ve played - it’s something everyone at Paradox profoundly enjoys. I’m also eager not to have to keep these announcements secret for much longer.”</p>
<p>Their show will start at March 6, 2023 at 18:00 CET / 17:00 UTC. You'll be able to watch on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/paradoxinteractive" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/paradoxinteractive" target="_blank">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be tuning in? What are you hoping to see announced?</p>

      <title>Inventory management roguelike Backpack Hero releases 1.0 in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in Early Access with Native Linux support and rated Steam Deck Playable, the inventory management roguelike Backpack Hero is releasing in full in May.</p>
<p>This is actually a surprising amount of fun thanks to the inventory sorting mechanic, and something I didn't expect to really like overall originally but it clearly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/backpack-hero-is-an-inventory-management-roguelike-and-my-new-favourite-game/" target="_blank">won me over easily</a> when I first started with it. The way it's designed really keeps you constantly thinking about all of your equipment, since the position in your bag is key and can really affect your power. Plenty of others agree since it has a Very Positive rating on Steam too.</p>
<p>Now the developer has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1970580/view/3646264166717131984" target="_blank">announced</a> they plan to have a 1.0 release in May along with major upgrades. Some of what's coming to it include a big Town Update adding in some more depth, Twitch integration and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fZLcGOJxGaw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/989aee7a52490447fe52f6a4fa88adf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fZLcGOJxGaw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1970580/Backpack_Hero/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

More work also went into supporting the likes of Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun but it's not ready yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6090485331677594753gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6090485331677594753gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured: OpenRA - Red Alert on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>Just some of the improvements to expect in the new release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New pathfinding for better performance.</li>
<li>Online play netcode improvements.</li>
<li>New Red Alert missions support.</li>
<li>New Tiberian Dawn missions support.</li>
<li>New text notifications for playing without sound.</li>
<li>Lots of smaller improvements to Dune 2000 (thanks to the film's popularity).</li>
<li>The ability to mute other players.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
<li>It's a <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/dc394e2f3532e7fe830118716ebdbaaa4e945eaf" target="_blank">long list</a> of improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modders also got some improvements to documentation, they have a VS Code plugin now for their scripting and a VS Code plugin for their Lua too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fury Unleashed, a fast-paced action roguelike from Awesome Games Studio, recently had a rather nice upgrade for Steam Deck players. It has full Linux support with a Native Linux version too, and it is now Steam Deck Verified using that Native build.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/465200/announcements/detail/5663873078633332449" target="_blank">update</a> released February 24th included these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better controller type detection for the in-game prompts.</li>
<li>Some UI elements, story segments &amp; text were enlarged for better readability.</li>
<li>The UI scaling option now defaults to 200% when the game is launched on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>When playing on Steam Deck in handheld mode, the "Auto" graphics settings no longer reduce the quality of the related options when the game's FPS/refresh rate is locked to a value lower than 60.</li>
<li>Other minor improvements &amp; bug/stability fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 27: Lost Souls</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-26-coming-to-you-live/" target="_blank">Part 26: Coming to You Live</a></strong></p>
<p>I have mentioned before how I was unable to get Dave Taylor's original port of <em>Doom</em> to work as it was built as an outdated a.out binary rather than ELF. Since then, I stumbled on an article by Jason Heiss that describes how to load the binfmt_aout kernel module to attain a.out binary support, as well as installing the ld.so-1.9.5-13.i386.rpm and aout-libs-1.4-9.i386.rpm packages from earlier Red Hat Linux releases to provide the necessary libraries.</p>
<p>Sure enough, with those in place the primordial Linux port of <em>Doom</em> works, albeit from an XFree86 server configured to run at only 8 bit colour depth. The other expected limitations apply such as the lack of any music, but the strangest issue I had was with the sound effects. On first launch I was hearing <em>Heretic</em> noises, as <em>Doom</em> was using the sndserver binary from the Linux Heretic source port installed in /usr/local/bin rather than its own. Replacing the sndserver solved the issue.</p>
<p>Another spanner in the works is that the X11 version of <em>Doom</em> is in effect keyboard only. A launch parameter does exist to grab the mouse, but this is bugged; I did get my Perixx PERIMICE-209 WP working with SVGALib by modifying the ~/.doomrc file to have mousdev set to "/dev/psaux" and mousetype set to "PS2". Under X11 the game runs in a 320x200 window with no full screen option, but you can double or triple the pixels using the "-2" and "-3" parameters.</p>
<p>The shareware release of <em>Doom</em> is included inside the linux-doom-1.8.tar.gz archive I used to install the xdoom and sdoom binaries. Explicit support is offered for the registered <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom II</em>, with <em>Final Doom </em>possible as a set of add-on WADs. Demo playback only works with the shareware, producing version errors everywhere else. A mixed bag to be sure, but even before the <em>Doom</em> source code was opened, hackers were making improvements to the Linux version.</p>
<p>A fan patch included in the udoom-1.1.tar.gz archive adds support for <em>The Ultimate Doom</em> and seems to fix the demos, while musserver.tgz even hacks in MIDI music through a separate musserver binary. I had to fake the /dev/sndstat device file, but it works. These changes would be mainlined after Bernd Kreimeier tidied up the Linux code for public release, but thanks to Dave Taylor's other studio Crack dot Com, I have another example of a.out insanity I can try as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7211078341676962040gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7211078341676962040gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13113369781676962061gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13113369781676962061gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Several iterations of the Linux binaries for <em>Abuse</em> are available, but I opted to install the abuse-1.10-5.i386.rpm package as distributed by Red Hat. This provides a few niceties such as custom launch scripts installed into the /usr/games directory, as well as the original <em>Abuse</em> shareware data with the alien ants storyline. The X11 version<em> </em>launches in a 320x200 window also at 8 bit colour depth<em>,</em> but you can stop the cursor leaving the window with the "-grab_pointer" launch parameter.</p>
<p>This is how <em>Abuse</em> was intended to be played, but you can toggle higher resolutions by using the "-size" parameter. This will disable the lighting engine, as well as exposing more of the level to the point of being considered a cheat by the developers. Due to this they also included a pixel doubling mode using the "-2" parameter that preserves the original viewing area and lighting at resolutions of 640x400 or above. I ran with 640x480 so I could hack full screen like I did with <em>Quake</em>.</p>
<p>A few effects will still only flash in the 320x200 area, and I did have some redrawing issues when loading saved games, but these always resolved themselves on the second attempt. The other problem I had was with the sound effects, which only worked when abuse.x11 was launched with root privileges. Speaking of needing root, abuse.svga which uses SVGALib starts fine but then stalls at the cursor; I even tried using an old Mouse Systems serial mouse with it but no dice.</p>
<p>If this sounds insecure, it is because it is. In fact, known privilege escalation exploits exist due to how the SVGALib version of <em>Abuse</em> executes its undrv and sndrv binaries. In some ways we should be grateful for such sloppiness, as it is how we got the SVGALib version of <em>Quake</em>. Dave Taylor only ported the game to X11, but thanks to the <em>Quake</em> source code being stolen from the Crack dot Com server, coder Greg Alexander was able to finish a port to SVGALib in just twenty four hours.</p>
<p>Alexander even had the chutzpah to submit the patches to John Carmack, who graciously accepted them without the threat of legal action. Crack dot Com would show the same community spirit by opening up the <em>Abuse</em> source code and releasing most of the <em>Abuse</em> shareware assets into the public domain. This allowed for the creation of enhanced source ports to Linux such as Abuse-SDL, as well as the fRaBs level set using the shareware assets. If only all games could be as lucky.</p>

      <title>Flathub seeks funding to add payments, donations and subscriptions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making the rounds recently is a proposal being made to add in payments, donations and subscriptions options to <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>The proposal is available on the Plaintext Group <a href="https://github.com/PlaintextGroup/oss-virtual-incubator/blob/main/proposals/flathub-linux-app-store.md" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, which was submitted by Robert McQueen, who is CEO of the Endless OS Foundation and GNOME Board President. For some context here Plaintext Group are "a nonpartisan, technology innovation policy initiative being developed by Schmidt Futures" (Schmidt Futures was founded by ex Google CEO Eric Schmidt).</p>
<p>As per the proposal they're trying to incentivize more "participation in the Linux application ecosystem, and remove financial barriers that prevent diverse participation" and they've already been working on adding in donations and payments on Flathub via Stripe and verify developers too with this year moving onto adding in subscriptions, reoccurring donations, new review tools to prevent abuse, automated security scanning and more to eventually have Flathub become self-sustaining. This is a joint effort between GNOME and KDE.</p>
<p>What they're trying to do is get extra funding to help towards their goal of expanding Flathub, as explained in the proposal they're seeking $100,000 USD from the Plaintext Group to cover the remaining budget needed to enable all this.</p>
<p>To note: this proposal has actually been there since November 2022, when the proposal itself was accepted into the GitHub repository for consideration.</p>
<p>What do you think to this? Especially interesting with Canonical recently going on the opposite direction by having Ubuntu <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/ubuntu-flavours-to-drop-flatpak-by-default-and-stick-to-snaps/" target="_blank">flavours remove Flatpak by default</a>.</p>
<p><em>Flathub is also going through a <a href="https://blog.jimmac.eu/2023/flathub-brand-refresh/" target="_blank">rebranding</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Kubuntu Focus announce the second-gen mini desktop Focus NX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some power in a small box with full Linux support? The Kubuntu Focus team recently revealed their second-generation Focus NX. This is a small form factor desktop that comes with Kubuntu (KDE Plasma desktop) 22.04 LTS.</p>
<p>Coming with either a Intel Core i7-1240P or i7-1260P (base model), it can be fitted with up to 64GB 3200Mhz RAM (8GB base model) and 2TB NVMe (250GB base model). Seems overall like a nice unit, and when you take into account pricing on all the parts together with dedicated Linux support. Pricing starts at $795 and it's basically a branded pre-configured Intel Wallstreet Canyon NUC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20746527091677498438gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>It comes filled with these ports:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 Gig+, up to 2.4 Gbit/s 802.11 ax</li>
<li>1 x Bluetooth 5.3</li>
<li>3 x USB-A 3.2 (2 in front, one in rear)</li>
<li>1 x USB-A 2.0 (rear)</li>
<li>1 x Audio Jack 3.5mm Headphone + Mic (front)</li>
<li>2 x Thunderbolt™ 4 / USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4a (rear)</li>
<li>2 x HDMI 2.1 (rear)</li>
<li>1 x RJ-45 Intel i225-V 2.5 GbE LAN (rear)</li>
<li>1 x Kensington Lock Mount</li>
<li>1 x Cable Management Bracket</li>
<li>1 x VESA Monitor-Mount Bracket</li>
</ul>
<p>From their Press Release:</p>
<p>“We feel the NX GEN 2 is a great replacement for 2- or 3-year-old high-performance systems: its CPU performance is excellent, yet it is far quieter and uses much less space and power,” says Michael Mikowski, General Manager. “The second generation improves on the first with better single- and multi-core performance, greater expandability, and updated ports.”</p>
<p>“Of course, the excellent hardware is only half of the story. Like with all our systems, we constantly test and distribute hardware optimizations through regular package upgrades. For example, the hardware-support subsystem for the NX GEN 2 adjusts the iGPU configuration to minimize flicker and maximize performance. We also ensure the system and kernel configuration is eGPU-ready and tested.”</p>
<p>They currently only ship to the US and Canada. </p>

      <title>Wayland driver for Wine is getting closer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/wine-on-wayland-sounds-like-its-coming-along-nicely/" target="_blank">late last year</a>, Collabora developer Alexandros Frantzis blogged about a whole lot of work going into getting full Wayland support for Wine and now a big first step towards it being included in Wine is happening.</p>
<p>Frantzis has now put up a <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2275" target="_blank">Merge Request</a>, to have the first of many parts begin to be included in Wine. This first part "introduces the Wayland driver PE and unixlib components with some basic code, and prepares the makedep tool to be able to handle Wayland protocol files".</p>
<p>So right now, it's not too exciting for end-users but a big step in the right direction and will lead to more being included, to then eventually having a full Wayland driver for Wine included. Frantzis mentioned Part 2 will include "basic Wayland wl_output (i.e., display) events and populate the Wine monitor information".</p>
<p>It's being done in parts since it's quite large and their goal is just to make it easier for people to review the code and suggest improvements as they go along. Seems like a sane idea.</p>

      <title>ScummVM 2.7.0 &#39;The Real Slim Shader&#39; supports even more classics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> 2.7.0, The Real Slim Shader, is officially out now bringing more compatibility for retro titles to modern platforms so here's what's new. What exactly is ScummVM? To put it simply: it's a whole set of different open source game engines under one roof, with each focusing on a different type of retro games.</p>
<p>First up, there's some fresh titles that had support added in 2.7.0 including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soldier Boyz</li>
<li>Obsidian</li>
<li>Pink Panther: Passport to Peril</li>
<li>Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink</li>
<li>Adibou 2 "Environment", "Read/Count 4 &amp; 5" and "Read/Count 6 &amp; 7"</li>
<li>Driller/Space Station Oblivion</li>
<li>Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II</li>
<li>Chop Suey, Eastern Mind, and 16 other Director 3 and Director 4 titles</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that they've improved support for the Broken Sword series and there's new translations including support added for: Chinese, Japanese and Korean versions of many games. Portability was also a focus this time around with a bunch of platforms revived to work with it including: RetroMini RS90 (using OpenDingux), 1st generation Miyoo (New BittBoy, Pocket Go and PowKiddy Q90-V90-Q20) with TriForceX MiyooCFW, Miyoo Mini, KolibriOS, 26-bit versions of RISC OS and Nintendo 3DS.</p>
<p>There's new shader-based scalers, going with their codename "The Real Slim Shader", so they say you can now again enjoy the "warm glow of CRTs shining on your face" and they ship with a curated set of shaders taken from LibRetro.</p>
<p>Lastly another highlight is pre-defined random number seeds so people can have reproducible runs in certain games, useful for speedrunners.</p>

      <title>X-Plane 12 now uses the open source Zink driver to help Plugins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is certainly fun to see. X-Plane 12 now makes use of the open source Zink driver, for doing OpenGL over Vulkan.</p>
<p>As Zink developer Mike Blumenkrantz mentioned in their <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/monumental/" target="_blank">blog post</a> "Zink has been commercialized" and they sound very happy about that. Zink is now a driver that "runs real games in production for real, existing people". A pretty impressive milestone for the project.</p>
<p>So what's this all about? As per the X-Plane 12 <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/2023/02/addressing-plugin-flickering/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the game developers have added Zink into the game. They're using it for their plugin system, which currently has some long-standing issues with native OpenGL drivers at times being rubbish. It's all highly technical stuff, and most normal players probably won't understand a lot of it.</p>
<p>X-Plane nowadays uses the Vulkan API or Metal (on macOS) but the problem is, they have a long history of plugins and plugin developers using OpenGL. So what they're now doing is using Zink as a go-between, having it sit "between plugins and X-Plane and translates plugin OpenGL rendering into native Vulkan commands that get executed by the same Vulkan device that X-Plane is using for rendering" — clever stuff.</p>
<p>The result they're going for is to have their plugin system work better than before, and potential performance improvements. There's the added bonus that they have a lot more control over everything too, and plugin developers also now have more power and better debugging options.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the finer details I suggest reading their <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/2023/02/addressing-plugin-flickering/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Flycast emulator for Dreamcast, Naomi, Naomi 2 gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh wow, I loved my old SEGA Dreamcast before it sadly ended up at a tech graveyard. For fans of emulation, the Flycast emulator has a new release out. I must gives this a try, maybe good for Steam Deck in bed…</p>
<p>The developer mentions it was "derived" from another project called Reicast, which is no longer updated. Supporting the Sega Dreamcast, Naomi, Naomi 2 and Atomiswave. Here's the highlights of Flycast 2.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full framebuffer emulation (Densha de Go 2, homebrew)</li>
<li>Linux AppImage builds</li>
<li>Automatic crash reporting with <a href="https://sentry.io/" target="_blank">Sentry</a></li>
<li>Broadcast arcade digital outputs (lights, force feedback) over the network</li>
<li>Android keyboard support</li>
<li>Various GDB fixes and improvements, CPU graphs, Profiler by <a href="https://github.com/BigEvilCorporation" target="_blank">@BigEvilCorporation</a> in <a href="https://github.com/flyinghead/flycast/pull/832" target="_blank">#832</a></li>
<li>Texture Upscaling for iOS by <a href="https://github.com/vkedwardli" target="_blank">@vkedwardli</a> in <a href="https://github.com/flyinghead/flycast/pull/805" target="_blank">#805</a></li>
<li>And many, many, many bug fixes and performance improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice to see another open source project coming along well! Have you been using Flycast? Let me know what you think in the comments and what your favourite games are to play with it.</p>

      <title>Totally Accurate Battlegrounds now works on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Totally Accurate Battlegrounds got upgraded recently due to needing to implement new anti-cheat, and thanks to that this free to play game now works on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The issue is that they were using EQU8, which is now exclusive to Splitgate. Instead they've switched to Easy Anti-Cheat, the newer EOS version, which they seem to have fully enabled for Linux too. Thanks to that, it will work just fine on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. I've tested that too and yup — works without issues on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10459493381677166583gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10459493381677166583gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Totally Accurate Battlegrounds on Fedora KDE 37.</em></p>
<p>Probably one of the silliest games around. It's a Battle Royale like Fortnite, but with wobbly-physics characters</p>
<p>Only quirk I noticed is that on Desktop Linux, I needed to restart Steam before it would actually load. Thanks to the new anti-cheat, hopefully there will be less cheaters too since obviously Epic Games have far more resources to put into EAC than EQU8 would have.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Up to 60 players (wobblin' around).</li>
<li>Squad, duo and solo mode (great for first dates).</li>
<li>Physics-based parkour (the wobblier the better).</li>
<li>Fun-sized map (for fun-sized people).</li>
<li>90+ weapons (including a shallow pot with a long handle).</li>
<li>Catchphrases (Speak freely in this game... Using 3 words).</li>
<li>Blessings and curses for those of you who do well (and not so well).</li>
<li>Limbo (u not dead yet mate).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/823130/view/3653017658282026315?l=english" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned how they're also opening up the game for people to host their own servers, so it can continue on potentially forever. This is a great move for a developer to do when they're no longer actively working on a game but I do wish more games just put server binaries out there for everyone but that's an argument and complaint for another day.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: First Contact releasing March 14th with a free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have announced that the Stellaris: First Contact Story Pack will be releasing on March 14th, along with the Canis Minor free update for all players.</p>
<p>First Contact is focused on new interactions and game mechanics for pre-FTL civilizations, which should make numerous parts of the game more interesting. Not only that, the new cloaking technology that will become available should enrich some spying and espionage. There's plenty more in it like new civilization origins and other new game mechanics to make it sound quite exciting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qWzw7CE21gY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67cce2c7114c9c700f97b35a5bcee9a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qWzw7CE21gY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Origins</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Broken Shackles</strong>: You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?</li>
<li><strong>Payback</strong>: No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own — until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!</li>
<li><strong>Fear of the Dark</strong>: As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pre-FTL</strong>: What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?</li>
<li><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Nobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available March 14th.</p>
<p>As for the free update they mentioned it will contain various gameplay improvements, add new "Archaeotechnologies" to dig up in the Ancient Relics Story Pack and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, the Linux distribution designed for couch gaming much like SteamOS, has version 39 out now. This is the first release since Valve swapped to the New Big Picture Mode from the Steam Deck. Designed very much to be just like SteamOS, except with a bunch of added extras, it boots directly into Steam Big Picture Mode.</p>
<p>Release version 39 comes with Linux kernel 6.1.11, Mesa 22.3.4 with ANV patches for Gamescope and NVIDIA 525.89.02.</p>
<p>Here's the main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Gamepad/Deck UI by default.</li>
<li>Fully Integrate system updates into the Gamepad/Deck UI.</li>
<li>Preserve non-Steam game shortcuts not created by the Chimera web app.</li>
<li>Added Nintendo DS support.</li>
<li>Updated install media with new system repair/recovery functionality.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where custom launch options and Steam input settings were not being applied.</li>
<li>Stability improvements to Hogwarts Legacy and possibly other games.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Flatpak desktop integration.</li>
<li>Added boot/splash animation (by Mark Tolle).</li>
<li>Fixed boot failure with Nvidia + certain Intel CPUs.</li>
<li>Improvements to Intel GPU compatibility.</li>
<li>HandyGCCS: Swapped default mapping for QAM and Guide buttons on OXP and AOKZOE devices. Guide will now. activate on a short press of the "orange/yellow" key.</li>
<li>HandyGCCS: Improved stuttering for gyro controls on supported devices.</li>
<li>Removable media will now be checked for compatibility when formatting.</li>
<li>Some supported Ryzen APU's will have their T-junction temp set to 95C automatically. This solves overheating issues in some handheld consoles.</li>
<li>The split_lock_detect kernel parameter is now set to off by default.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ubuntu flavours to drop Flatpak by default and stick to Snaps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has announced a change in the packaging defaults for the various "flavours" like Kubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Budgie and so on to exclude Flatpak and stick with Snap. <em>Yes that's <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours" target="_blank">flavours</a>, not flavors but also flavors in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</em></p>
<p>This is no doubt going to be a hot topic, because name me a more intense argument in the Linux world than <em><strong>packaging</strong></em>. While Flatpak has been gaining many fans lately, partly because it's included as the official way to install extra packages in Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck, Canonical are sticking to their own Snap.</p>
<p>So what's going on? In short: Ubuntu flavours will no longer have Flatpak enabled or setup by default. However, users can still do it themselves as they're not being removed from any repositories. It's all about the out of the box experience, with Canonical and the flavours now sticking to deb and snap to maintain their focus on what is actually properly supported by them and gets the most attention.</p>
<p>Users who have Flatpak installed won't see any changes, it's just the out of the box new-install experience as of April 2023, with the release of Ubuntu Lunar Lobster.</p>
<p>This is, after all, why we have different distributions isn't it? They're free to make whatever decisions they wish, and people who don't like it can go elsewhere, <em>or</em> just change the defaults to their liking — Linux is open and configurable unlike certain other systems. Do what you want.</p>
<p>So while it's going to be controversial, it's not exactly a big deal is it? Sort of. It's still making the desktop Linux experience quite <em>messy</em>, especially for newer users since there's no single way of installing things across different Linux distributions. You can't usually just point people to this thing and say get that, unless you first know the exact distribution they're on.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts you can comment on the announcement and let them know.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Fractal gets a VR overhaul, new Expedition, Gyro update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No Man's Sky has another big update out now that includes an overhaul of quite a few features like much better VR support, and a new Expedition. The game continues to run nicely on Steam Deck and Linux Desktop with Proton.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1628400975097520128" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the official account mentioned "Fractal brings gyroscopic support to Switch, PlayStation and Steam Deck players" but from my own testing, there's <em>no</em> special gyro settings actually in-game for the Windows version run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck. They do have an extra Steam Input configuration specifically for Gyro on Steam Deck though, which just sets the Gyro on the right thumbstick to act as Mouse movement with some settings adjusted for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18489076281677149199gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18489076281677149199gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12405602961677149200gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12405602961677149200gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The official changelog also only mentions PlayStation and Nintendo Switch for Gyro. Still nice to have it all pre-configured though via Steam Input. It at least seems to work the same as their brief clip of it on Nintendo Switch in the previously linked tweet in my testing of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12347708041677149547gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12347708041677149547gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>It doesn't work <em>all</em> the time though. Sometimes the Gyro just stops working until I do another random action or two, but it's not clear if that's a game bug or a Steam Input bug on Steam Deck. <em>I've <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1628707780939972608" target="_blank">asked</a> for more info.</em></p>
<p>There's also the new Expedition, improved HDR lighting, a new Utopia Speeder starship, clearer game settings when starting a game, new visual affects around ancient portals, plaques, and monoliths, overhauled VR support, new accessibility options and much more.</p>

      <title>Valve tricks Dota 2 cheaters and then bans 40,000 of them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a new post titled "<a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3677788723152833273" target="_blank">Cheaters Will Never Be Welcome in Dota</a>", Valve mentioned how they managed to get a whole lot of cheaters to show themselves and then gave them a swift boot to the buttocks.</p>
<p>Valve mentioned how they managed to ban 40,000 cheaters that were using third-party software over the last few weeks. How though? It's actually quite clever! They created a honeypot to trap people, and similar to a way you used to be able to fight some spam bots on website registration forms.</p>
<p>This third-party cheating software was able to show people things they weren't supposed to see during normal play, giving them an unfair advantage. So Valve added a bit that no one should see, which this cheating software showed people and so Valve could then have "extremely high confidence that every ban was well-deserved".</p>
<p>Valve make it clear that while the initial ban wave was "particularly large", it's just all part of their ongoing effort to remove cheaters from Dota 2, which is usually done in secret but they wanted a public example of their effort.</p>
<p>Good job Valve.</p>
<p>Dota 2 is free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>1980s mystery adventure Unusual Findings added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one from late last year that I missed, 1980s mystery adventure Unusual Findings gained a Native Linux version. The new support was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1605320/view/3492007864115413981" target="_blank">announced</a> for Linux and macOS back in November 2022 where the developer mentioned they "worked day and night to polish and release versions of Unusual Findings for macOS and Linux".</p>
<p><em>The game launched in October, so that's a pretty good turnaround time to get a Linux version out.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "It’s the 80s and the Christmas is coming, Vinny, Nick and Tony are young and their new cable signal descrambler just arrived. That same night while trying to decrypt a pay per view adult channel, they pick up the distress signal of an alien spaceship crash-landing in the woods near their town… Things only get weirder as they realize that the towering alien is killing very specific members of their community!"</p>

<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Follow the Sci-Fi coming-of-age story. Three friends fighting together against the unknown… things (maybe against some known things too).</li>
<li>See, Grab and Talk action tokens, an inventory to use and combine items and your wits it’s all you need to play.</li>
<li>Stylized Pixel Art. All the charm of pixel art of the past with more colors and the new effects of the future. Some pixels look so real they can almost jump out of the screen*</li>
<li>Go back to a simpler time where mix tapes were a thing, Commodore 64 was a king, kids could play outside late at night and the only thing to worry about was THE GIANT KILLER ALIEN TRYING TO GET YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.</li>
<li>The decisions you make affect the relations between characters and thus the puzzles, the game progression and the story.</li>
<li>The most radical music a synthesizer can play. Cool popular Synthwave Music alongside catchy tunes made exclusively for the game to power up the 80s vibes.</li>

      <title>Environmental strategy game Terra Nil releases March 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game idea I absolutely love and the early demos were impressive, the environmental strategy game Terra Nil releases on March 28th. In this game you're transforming a ruined wasteland, to bring it back to life and get it green. Purify the soil, clean up the oceans, get rivers flowing, plant some trees and make it right.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wpX9MsuUmow"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b67b7689f3f2b7b6428f5ed631c754d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wpX9MsuUmow" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A reverse city builder - Use advanced eco-technology to purify the soil, creating plains, wetlands, beaches, rainforests, wildflowers, and more—then efficiently recycle everything you've built, leaving the environment pristine for its new animal inhabitants.</li>
<li>Different maps every time - Procedurally generated landscapes mean no two playthroughs of Terra Nil will ever be the same. Plan your build around randomized, challenging, and unpredictable terrain, including snaking rivers, mountains, lowlands, and oceans.</li>
<li>A natural ebb and flow - Each region of Terra Nil progresses through phases, with the ultimate goal being leaving pristine wilderness behind. Levels are not about infinite growth, but rather balancing and nurturing the environment before leaving it in peace.</li>
<li>Experience tranquility - Lush hand-painted environments, relaxing music, and an atmospheric ambient soundscape make Terra Nil a peaceful, meditative experience. When you're done, use Appreciate mode to bask in the natural beauty of the ecosystem you have restored.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Steam Deck support, the developer said they're "working to get it verified" and for direct Linux support they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1593030/eventcomments/3776868105349343572/?tscn=1676986768#c3776868105352654673" target="_blank">said</a> it's "something the team will be looking at asap". I'll be happily taking a look at this one, because I really did absolutely love the earlier tech demos before they decided to turn it into a full game, it was wonderful to play even back then.</p>

      <title>Wreckfest is a smashing good time on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Got the need for speed? You should check out Wreckfest! It's a lot of fun and it works amazingly well on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This isn't a new game, far from it, Wreckfest was released back in 2018. One reason I wanted to try it is that I love these destruction derby style games, and the developer clearly cares about the Steam Deck experience too since they put in a dedicated crash-bug <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/228380/view/3672156687242497774" target="_blank">fix</a>. It's hilarious too, you get to drive a speedy lawn mower and even a motorized sofa — and it's as ridiculous as it sounds.</p>
<p>Performance really is surprising too, with it <em>mostly</em> giving a smooth 60FPS on Medium on Steam Deck with Proton 7.0-6. Check out my Steam Deck video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kJCuxX7SKuQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4de3b6c38b1c417b5d9fe368f130d026.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kJCuxX7SKuQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how it runs on Desktop Linux? Trying it there too on Fedora KDE 37 with my Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and it's a bit different. The Epic and even High settings presets at 1440p did not give a smooth 60FPS, some tracks really struggled. Swapping it down to 1080p, and it <em>didn't</em> make enough of a difference.</p>
<p>The performance on desktop is just odd. At the start of a lot of races, the performance will be a fair amount lower than even 30 seconds into the race, when you're sat with all the other cars. Once you get properly into a race, even on more demanding tracks, the framerate goes up quite a bit sometimes (not always) so it seems directly tied to how many cars you're seeing so turning down the amount of cars on an event will help.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170485841676979087gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170485841676979087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Ignore the big spike on the graph, that's the screenshot being taken. I don't entirely get why, even when making a screenshot without a UI via terminal, that it causes such performance spikes in games. Likely some sort of x11 issue. Wayland still isn't usable enough with NVIDIA for me.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 26: Coming to You Live</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-25-quantum-axcess/" target="_blank">Part 25: Quantum Axcess</a></strong></p>
<p>I have referenced a number of times now some of my experiences with Knoppix, which prompted me to see if I could still find the original CD-R disc I used back in the day. It turns out it was Knoppix 3.4 released in May 2004 that obsessed me as a child, providing me with some of my earliest steps into a larger world. Not only that, but the CD-R disc it was burned on still reads even after all of these years. Considering the volatility of such media, this surprised me.</p>
<p>Named for its creator Klaus Knopper of Germany, Knoppix is a derivative of Debian which pioneered the modern Linux live media experience at the turn of the millennium. While the honour of being the first Linux live CD goes to Yggdrasil close to a full decade earlier, it was Knoppix that truly showed how powerful and effective Linux from a CD could be to the masses. In fact, everything that Knoppix manages can best be described as no small miracle.</p>
<p>Operating out of system memory by use of a RAM drive, the fact that Knoppix does not even flinch at my paltry 512 MB of RAM is impressive enough. Adding to this feat, most of my hardware was detected and configured without the need for any prompting from me. The only exception to this was the DRI module for my Rage 128 Pro graphics card not being loaded by default, but this was easily addressed by passing the "knoppix xmodule=r128" boot option during start up. </p>
<p>Lack of disk space forced me to be selective when installing Red Hat Linux 7.3 to my hard drive, meaning I just stuck with the default Gnome 1.4 desktop environment and the applications contained therein. As such, getting myself reacquainted with KDE 3 again proved to be a treat. Included here are versions of <em>KAtomic, KAsteroids</em>, <em>KBattleship, KBounce</em>, <em>KMahjongg</em>, <em>KReversi</em>, and <em>KSokoban</em>. There is also the fun if sometimes off putting <em>Potato Guy</em> software toy.</p>
<p>Alongside the bundled KDE games were a few familiar faces. Included on the CD was <em>The Ace of Penguins</em> card game suite as was also featured in <em>100 Great Linux Games</em>, and I could at long last play and win the final 1.0.0 version of <em>Frozen Bubble</em> that refused to build for me on Red Hat Linux. Level 70 proved its potency once more, although I did spend longer tackling the final level of the game this time. Perhaps Level 70 should be moved to be the penultimate level instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1732091021676594965gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1732091021676594965gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7108996271676539746gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7108996271676539746gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Another favourite included with Knoppix 3.4 is <em>iMaze</em>, a client/server pseudo-3D deathmatch game inspired by <em>MIDI Maze</em> for the Atari ST. Alongside multiplayer, <em>iMaze</em> even sports support for computer controlled bots called ninjas through the use of a separate application, which go on to show that even smiley faces can be terrifying. There is just something sinister about their sacharine visages stalking the primitive single level landscape, even if they do get stuck on edges.</p>
<p>Other games bundled on the disc include <em>GNU Chess</em>, <em>gTans</em>, <em>Netris</em>, <em>XBattle</em>, <em>XBoard</em>, <em>XBoing II, XGalaga</em>, <em>XKoules</em>, and <em>XSkat</em>. Also present is <em>Falcon's Eye</em>, which runs just about as well I remember it did. In a similar boat is <em>Chromium B.S.U. </em>which produced a black screen on launch. Clearly some games are better suited to running off of live media than others. <em>Enigma</em> meanwhile gave me I/0 errors, but that may just be the CD-R showing its age at last.</p>
<p>Having gotten 3D acceleration to work, I decided to do my usual OpenGL test by loading <em>Quake III Arena</em> from the hard drive, which launched without complaint. I did encounter the same graphical glitches with shadows and marks on walls that I had experienced with Red Hat Linux 9 however, demonstrating beyond a doubt that there was a regression introduced into the driver upstream. Beyond this <em>Quake III Arena</em> ran beautifully from Knoppix.</p>
<p>This qualified success got me wondering if could at long last also play the ultimate 2005 release of <em>Cube</em>, which did indeed also start up just fine. No graphical glitches were apparent, although the performance did seem to suffer in comparison to the earlier <em>Cube</em> release I had been playing. Whether this was due to increased graphical demands in the latest version of the game, or simply the fact I was running it from a live environment, I am unsure.</p>
<p>While my principle interest in playing around with Knoppix was that of nostalgia, having a later Linux distribution on hand with support for applications on the other side of the glibc 2.3 boundary may well come in handy going forward. This is far from the only compatibility issue to have frustrated my attempts to get certain games to work in the past, but after having just previously dismissed the possibility of getting one of them running, I suddenly had a major breakthrough.</p>

      <title>Dead Space got a small update for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In case you missed it in my recent <a href="https://youtu.be/kVfGOsMI1Hs" target="_blank">Steam Deck news video</a>, Motive released an update for the new Dead Space to improve it even more on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While at release Dead Space did not work well on Steam Deck, it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/valve-fix-dead-space-steam-deck/" target="_blank">fixed up rather quickly</a> by Valve with Proton and it has become Steam Deck Verified. Now, the actual game developer has taken notice. In their latest patch info they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1693980/view/3648515515970783142" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "Steam Deck Improvements" which was noted at the top before listing a bunch of gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>Sadly, they didn't go into <em>any</em> detail at all, so we're back to non-descriptive on-liners like this. I always find it weird that sometimes developers don't actually explain <em>what</em> they did. Reminds me of a lot of mobile app and console updates that list things like "stability improvements" without giving a clue as to what was changed — such secrecy annoys me. Like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/the-callisto-protocol-got-a-steam-deck-upgrade/" target="_blank">The Callisto Protocol now hides</a> the benchmark mode on Steam Deck. Still, it's nice to see developers pay attention to a Linux gaming device.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution game Thrive adds part upgrades and a benchmark mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Benchmark the cells! Evolve all the things! Thrive 0.6.1 is a fun sounding upgrade to this free and open source scientific evolution sim.</p>
<p>One of the big new features is the ability to actually upgrade parts. While it's early days for the feature with only one part able to use it, they can and will be expanding it across many other parts included in the game. The idea is to give you a bit more freedom in how you play it. Right now you can upgrade the Cilia to pull things in from a distance and the more you have the stronger the pull.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12767321261676898365gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12767321261676898365gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also the new Benchmark mode to see how your PC will run it over time, which also gives the developers a good way to keep an eye on what they need to optimize in it. </p>
<p>Some of the other changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Patch notes are now shown in the main menu first time when playing a new Thrive version.</li>
<li>Added buttons in main menu and the pause menu to open the link for reporting bugs.</li>
<li>Added new auto-evo exploring tool features (exporting data, running multiple worlds in a row + others).</li>
<li>Evolutionary tree now works for freebuild games started with a fossil.</li>
<li>Added day/night cycle tutorial.</li>
<li>It is now possible to rebind and see controller buttons in the options menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's becoming quite an impressive game, while a little difficult to get into at the start they've done a pretty good job on expanding the tutorial to give you a good idea on what to do and how to survive. I don't seem to be dying as early and often as I was a few versions ago.</p>

      <title>OpenRA has another test release improving Dune 2000, Red Alert and major bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenRA is closing in on another big new release to improve the experience of playing Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and Dune 2000.</p>
<p>As a brief reminder: OpenRA is a very flexible RTS game engine, primarily aimed at getting the likes of Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and Dune 2000 easily playable cross-platform with a number of enhancements while keeping the core gameplay intact but it's also used for a few other games now too. They're working towards Tiberian Sun support too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6416788991676897242gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6416788991676897242gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Red Alert on Fedora KDE Linux.</em></p>
<p>Available now with Playtest 20230218:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple nuisance crash bugs fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed the map editor not being able to resave .oramap files with subfolders.</li>
<li>Red Alert:
<ul>
<li>Fixed the descriptions of the parabomb and paradrop support powers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dune 2000:
<ul>
<li>Fixed Deviators being able to take over friendly vehicles.</li>
<li>Polished the Encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>+ More.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all in addition to the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/openra-for-classic-command-a-conquer-dune-2000-red-alert-has-a-new-playtest/" target="_blank">Playtest from late 2022</a> that had lots of big improvements. See more on the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA website</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that when OpenRA finally gets Tiberian Sun support, you might not hear from me for a while. I'm far too excited about that.</p>

      <title>Free 2D space exploration sim Endless Sky v0.10.0 adds new factions, gets better AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love free and open source games keep an eye on the 2D space sim Endless Sky, which just got a new Beta release with version 0.10.0 giving some fresh gameplay improvements. Currently in Beta, so it's not quite a full release yet.</p>
<p>As a reminder on what it is: Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game inspired by the classic Escape Velocity series. Work your way up from a relatively wimpy shuttle, cargo ship, or fighter, to a highly upgraded and customized flagship or to a massive fleet of warships or freighters.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19497636901676896048gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's an overview of what's new in v0.10.0 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Breaking changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The accompany objective on mission npcs no longer implicitly sets the save objective. Plugin missions that had "accompany" but not "save" should be changed to include "save" if the intention of the mission is that the npcs live.
<ul>
<li>This is a change that was made in v0.9.16, reverted in v0.9.16.1, and has been reintroduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Content and features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new alien factions, the Gegno and Bunrodea.</li>
<li>A plethora of new conditions and new ways to use them, including the introduction of "global conditions" that can be set and accessed across save files.</li>
<li>Improvements to how ship AI behaves, more intelligently making use of the range of their weapons. More AI improvements will come in the future.</li>
<li>An overhaul to how cargo and outfit scanners function, causing scanning to take overall longer to complete.</li>
<li>The jobs board can now be sorted on various metrics, including how much the job pays or whether it has a deadline.</li>
<li>Improved mouse control while in flight, including the ability to select secondary weapons by clicking on their ammo icons, and a toggle for controlling flagship aiming and firing with the mouse.</li>
<li>Reverted the heat damage change from v0.9.15, and reduced the buffs provided to afterburners from that same update.</li>
<li>Added a deadline to bounty jobs so that they cannot be stacked infinitely and finished passively. In exchange, bounty ships now don't spawn as far away, and bounty job payments are increased.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<li>Intel Arc Graphics improvements.</li>
<li>Optional Splitlock changes to help gaming.</li>
<li>Initial NVIDIA Ampere (RTX 30) support in nouveau.</li>
<li>Various work and drivers for Wi-Fi 7 support.</li>
<li>Improvements to Sony controller support like DualShock 4 and DualSense.</li>
<li>OneXPlayer mini (AMD) and AOK ZOE A1 sensor support.</li>
<li>Btrfs file system performance improvements.</li>
<li>Various exFAT file system improvements.</li>

<li>Performance improvement for Intel Skylake.</li>
<li>A driver for the ChromeOS human presence sensor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full changelog is available over <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.2" target="_blank">here</a> and as usual <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-62-features" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> does a nice overview.</p>

      <title>Minecraft 1.20 adding Archaeology, Cherry Blossom Biome and a Sniffer mob</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's lots to be excited for in the upcoming Minecraft 1.20 update, with many previously announced features finally landing like Archaeology. Yes, it's finally being added. <em>Want to get Minecraft on Steam Deck? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/minecraft-on-steam-deck-guide-with-prism-launcher-and-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">Check out my guide</a>!</em></p>
<p>Archaeology was originally announced for the Caves &amp; Cliffs Update which got delayed but hooray it's still going to be a thing. Seems like a natural fit for a sandbox digging game like this too. In their official <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/archeology-coming-minecraft-120" target="_blank">blog post</a> the team at Mojang mentioned it's currently enabled for deserts where you can pick a plot inside a desert temple and get digging but they do plan to add more dig site areas over time. Eventually you'll find some suspicious sand, and then get a brush out to extract whatever is hiding inside.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17017700151676892050gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17017700151676892050gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16871071781676892051gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16871071781676892051gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big addition is a new rare Cherry Blossom Biome. Mojang <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/cherry-blossom-biome-coming-minecraft-120" target="_blank">say</a> it will be filled with cherry blossom trees, that can be broken down into a full set of wood and a new hanging sign. You'll even get saplings for them, to spread them wherever you want. Sounds sweet.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20399670171676892221gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20399670171676892221gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2501530331676892223gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2501530331676892223gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Finally as another big addition the Sniffer mob is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/sniffer-coming-minecraft-120" target="_blank">coming</a>, this is what won the mob vote at Minecraft Live 2022. They will require some exploring to find as their eggs may be hidden in suspicious sand and apparently the hatching process is a little more interesting so you will need to keep watch. Once a Snifflet grows up into a Sniffer, it will be rather large and also helpful since it will sniff out special kinds of seeds to give you unique decorative plants.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5272648291676892490gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5272648291676892490gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I think I really am due for another Minecraft play-through soon. They've added some really great stuff in the last couple of updates, but I think I'll be waiting for this update to really get the most out of my time with it.</p>
<p>Have you built anything fun in it lately?</p>

      <title>CryoUtilities 2.0 helps boost Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CryoUtilities has a big new 2.0 release out now, with plenty of tweaks to help you get the most out of your Steam Deck. Previously it simply offered some Swap sizing tweaks but now it can do more, and makes it easier than ever to use.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that Valve are at least investigating some of these changes, since they can often boost game performance. In fact, some of these tweaks are absolutely essential to stop certain games just hard-crashing and rebooting the Steam Deck like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn (amongst others — although not everyone encounters the issue).</p>
<p><em>Screenshots, click to enlarge:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1638522751676890796gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1638522751676890796gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1678745421676890798gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1678745421676890798gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Features now available with the 2.0 release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One-click set-to-recommended settings.</li>
<li>One-click revert-to-stock settings.</li>
<li>Swap Tuner.
<ul>
<li>Swap File Resizer.</li>
<li>Swappiness Changer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory Parameter Tuning.
<ul>
<li>HugePages Toggle.</li>
<li>Compaction Proactiveness Changer.</li>
<li>HugePage Defragmentation Toggle.</li>
<li>Page Lock Unfairness Changer.</li>
<li>Shared Memory (shmem) Toggle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storage Manager.
<ul>
<li>Sync shadercache and compatdata to the same location the game is installed.</li>
<li>Delete shadercache and compatdata for whichever games you select.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full CLI mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See their full video below where they explain the changes and show some benchmark comparisons:</p>

<p>Have you used it? What is your experience with it? I think I'm going to look into testing it out and seeing if it can boost a few problematic games soon.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One Valve game that is clearly unstoppable is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, their first-person shooter from 2012 just keeps growing. Being free to play certainly helps too of course.</p>
<p>Hitting a new all-time high for online players at ~1,320,219 on February 11th, it just smashed it again at 1,324,800 players online on February 19th. You can see all the info on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> charts, which clearly shows it's doing well. Before that, the last time it broke the record was back in April at 1,308,963 players online.</p>
<p>No doubt a continued nice earner for Valve (not that they need it…) with all the cases you can buy, and while free to play it still has a Prime Status Upgrade for £11.99 which is needed for Ranked Matchmaking and earning XP.</p>
<p>Valve also just recently released the Revolution Case, featuring 17 weapon finishes from community artists and the gloves from the Clutch Case as rare special items. On top of that there's also the new Espionage Sticker Capsule, with 21 unique stickers from Steam Workshop artists. Additionally they also added in the Denzel Curry ULTIMATE music kit, featuring Denzel’s hits "Walkin", "ULTIMATE" and more from his 2022 album "Melt My Eyez See Your Future".</p>

<p>CS:GO truly has some impressive staying power for what's quite an old game now.</p>
<p>Are you still playing CS:GO? How many hours do you have in it now?</p>

      <title>The upcoming Team Fortress 2 update may not be as big as expected</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember all the hype over the announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/valve-proper-big-team-fortress-2-update-is-coming/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2 update</a>? Well, it seems Valve edited the announcement silently and hoped no one would notice.</p>
<p>Originally the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/TF2/announcements/detail/3669906790333865368" target="_blank">announcement</a> mentioned it would be an "update-sized update" and now it says it's a "holiday-sized update". It also said before "and who knows what else?!" which has been completely removed, which significantly downplays the excitement over it. </p>
<p>Still should be quite fun for TF2 players with the new "items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints, and other community-contributed fixes" but still — a little odd to have such a silent edit. Perhaps the original writer of the announcement was themselves a bit too excited about it, with someone else at Valve gave them a quiet word to not hype people up over it too much?</p>
<p>We'll find out later this year when it releases. Hopefully it won't be the last, would be nice to see Valve continue to upgrade their classics like TF2 don't you think?</p>

      <title>Steam now allows transferring games between PCs and Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Client Beta available for Desktop Steam and Steam Deck, Valve put in a new feature to help you transferring games.</p>
<p>If enabled in your Steam Downloads settings, you can transfer games and update files from one PC to another, or from PC to Steam Deck. Useful in many different situations like having limited bandwidth, slow internet speeds, LAN parties and you get the idea. Here's a video to highlight the feature as well as various other bits of Steam Deck / Linux news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kVfGOsMI1Hs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c1fa165c7422fab35c2d298e2858843.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kVfGOsMI1Hs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3673285123502439065" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Steam Deck Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some issues where focus was lost after exiting a game</li>
<li>Reduced flashing in background when scrolling through games on home screen</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Local Network Game Transfers</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new feature that allows Steam users to copy existing Steam game installation and update files from one PC to another over a local area network, without having to download and install from a Steam content server on the internet. This reduces internet traffic and can speed up installs or updates.</li>
<li>This feature is currently only PC -&gt; PC or PC -&gt; Steam Deck, and both sender and receiver must be opted into Steam Beta.</li>
<li>Steam users have control over who files can be sent to: self only, friends only, or everyone. The default setting is self only.</li>
<li>More info about this new feature can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/46BD-6BA8-B012-CE43" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a loading throbber when waiting on Steam Cloud to update</li>
<li>Improved the latency of querying the workshop in the Configuration Browser and fix issues with configurations popping-in or opening the wrong tab because results weren't fully received</li>
<li>Added a loading throbber that shows while the Configuration Browser workshop query is running</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode: Steam</p>
<ul>
<li>Added UI that temporarily takes over the "What's New" section of the Library when pre-purchased games are available to pre-load or install and play</li>
<li>Added UI at startup for account selection</li>
<li>Added a "sign out" option to the main menu that removes credentials for the signed in account from the machine</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when the OS is notifying Steam that it should shutdown</li>
<li>Improved performance of games when using Steam Workshop APIs</li>
<li>Refreshed the profile games page with a new style and improved performance</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode: Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where the old BPM on-screen keyboard would appear at the same time as the new BPM virtual keyboard</li>
<li>Fixed issue where user could not re-enter a context submenu after backing out of it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for Desktop Steam, they also finally started getting the New Big Picture mode working better with NVIDIA GPUs, which has been pretty terrible in terms of performance. To be honest though, I can't tell any difference and if anything, it actually feels even worse than before.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732230701676744527gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732230701676744527gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>These are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3642885192596178104" target="_blank">also noted</a> <em>just</em> for Desktop Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where incoming chat messages would not be delivered properly while in-game.</li>
<li>Added support for the Sony DualSense Edge controller including support for remapping of the rear buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Steam preventing PS4 controllers from being read over DirectInput when Steam Input was disabled. Note: this was already hotfixed into the non-Beta Steam client.</li>
</ul>

      <title>iFixit begin offering Steam Deck SSD upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more options to upgrade your Steam Deck SSD! The folks at iFixit have begun offering SSDs and upgrade kits.</p>
<p>Nice to see in addition to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/framework-begin-offering-2tb-ssd-upgrades-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/scan-uk-to-offer-ssd-upgrades-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Scan UK</a>, as these smaller SSDs have been a little difficult to come by. The more that stock them and the more that sell, the more likely they are to spread further and come down in price after a while too.</p>
<p>As for what iFixit are offering they have the Micron 2400 NVMe SSD in 512GB, 1TB and 2TB editions with either their Upgrade Kit or just the SSD by itself. It looks like currently they're only in the US (didn't show up for EU / UK). Pricing goes from $99.99 for just the 512GB SSD up to $304.99 for the 2TB SSD plus the Upgrade Kit so it can be a little on the pricy side still right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4043943981676719156gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4043943981676719156gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd" target="_blank">iFixit Store</a>.</p>
<p>Are you planning to do an SSD upgrade or have you done it already? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Wine 8.2 rolls out along with a new Proton Experimental update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today we've seen an update for two translation layers. Wine has development release 8.2 available, and there's an update for Proton Experimental too.</p>
<p>As a reminder: Wine is a translation layer that runs Windows apps and games on other platforms including Linux. Proton is what Valve use on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck to run many thousands of games and Wine is part of Proton!</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.2" target="_blank">Wine 8.2</a> here's the release highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better debug information in Wow64 mode.</li>
<li>Wow64 thunks in the WPCAP library.</li>
<li>Indeo IV50 codec support.</li>
<li>Monitor names set from EDID data.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wine developers also noted 22 bugs fixed including issues with Visual Studio, GOG Heroes of Might and Magic IV, Final Fantasy XI, various vbscript memory leaks and various other miscellaneous improvements.</p>
<p><em>Want help managing Wine on Linux? You can try <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> and the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a>.</em></p>
<p>On the Proton Experimental side, there's been two small updates since I last wrote about it. For the update on February 10th the single noted fix was for "Arabic fonts in FIFA 21 and 22". While today's Proton Experimental update also notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix multiplayer in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition.</li>
<li>Improve monitor names visible in settings in Hogwart Legacy and other games. (X11 only)</li>
<li>Fix Wild Hearts keyboard input issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Proton changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. At some point this year I expect Valve will rebase Proton on the Wine 8.x series but no word as to when that will happen.</p>
<p>To change the version of Proton used by games on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck:</p>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open a game in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go to the settings icon on the far right and click it.</li>
<li>Select Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; tick the box -&gt; select from the dropdown box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Linux Desktop</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right click any game in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Select Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; tick the box -&gt; select from the dropdown box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a video too:</p>

      <title>A new Civilization game is in development and XCOM designer leaves Firaxis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K sent out a press release today confirming a number of things including a new Civilization game is on the way.</p>
<p>In the press release they noted that Jake Solomon, Creative Director on XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns, is leaving after two decades at the company after being a big part of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, XCOM 2, and Marvel's Midnight Suns. Not only that, industry veteran Heather Hazen has been bumped up from Firaxis Games Chief Operating Officer to Studio Head. Hazen previously worked as Executive Producer on Fortnite at Epic Games, as well as Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled while at PopCap Games.</p>
<p>Not much was said about the new Civilization apart from Hazen's own statement in the press release:</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to carry on the studio's storied legacy, beginning with the announcement that Firaxis is in development on the next iteration of the legendary Civilization franchise," said Hazen. "I'm lucky to be working with some of the best developers in our industry, and we have plans to take the Civilization franchise to exciting new heights for our millions of players around the world.  In addition, we will continue to support Marvel's Midnight Suns with post-launch content, and explore new creative projects for our teams."</p>
<p>It's probably quite <em>unlikely </em>that the new Civilization will have Native Linux support, given that Aspyr Media aren't really doing any more porting like it. With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> as good as it is now, no doubt by the time it releases it would work quite well anyway on Linux.</p>

      <title>All Your Base Are Belong to Us — Zero Wing (and other classics) hit Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zero Wing along with other shoot 'em up classics Out Zone, Twin Cobra and Truxton from Toaplan and Bitwave Games have their brand new PC releases out.</p>
<p>Quite disappointingly though, the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/qItugh-fFgg" target="_blank">meme</a> "All your base are belong to us" from Zero Wing that was in the Sega Mega Drive (Sega Genesis) version is absent from this new release. This is due to each of the games being upgraded from the original Arcade game versions. However, the good news is that a patch is coming that will add the cutscene back in, it just wasn't ready for the main release.</p>
<p>Some of the upgrades available for the games includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Quality-focused features such as minimal input lag, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Instrument Panels featuring additional gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind feature allowing gamers to rewind between 10-18 minutes of play.</li>
<li>Assist features facilitating options such as auto-fire.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode, allowing beginners to master each game at their own pace.</li>
<li>Pixel-perfect display option or full-screen scaling in both windowed and full-screen modes.</li>
<li>Rotate option allowing the action to be rotated in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam® Input.</li>
<li>Practice mode, allowing gamers to hone their skills.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See their release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AwXoPPNx5QY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ebaec3aa340eceba7caa757884fdf9bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AwXoPPNx5QY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All of them have <strong>Native Linux</strong> support and after testing on Steam Deck as they sent over a copy of each to me, they will <em>easily</em> be fully Steam Deck Verified. I've had a lot of fun with them, and they're all as difficult as I remember. Zero Wing in particular used to kick my ass on Mega Drive but it remained as one of my favourite shoot 'em ups and overall Bitwave Games have done a real quality job on them.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Tatsujin CEO, and legendary Toaplan developer, Masahiro Yuge, commented, “We’re humbled that gamers today hold our games in such high regard, it’s a testament to the work we put into making each title a memorable experience. We’re glad these titles have stood the test of time and we’re delighted to bring them to a new audience through the release of Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Collection Vol.1.”</p>
<p>Niklas Istenes, CEO of Bitwave Games, said, “Developing this premier volume of much-loved shooters has been a labour of love and one which we know our community is excited to play. We’re so happy to finally release the first in our planned collection and can’t wait to see what scores gamers manage to achieve on the online leader boards! We look forward to announcing more about our future plans for the collection soon, and we’re confident gamers will fall in love with these games all over again."</p>

<p>While you could get them elsewhere, and then emulate them, I'm a huge fan of click and play releases like this for classics that come with enhancements built-in. It just makes playing them a whole lot nicer. I can easily recommend picking up these classics because sometimes they really don't make them like they used to. I'm extremely keen to see what they have cooking up for more upgraded retro releases like this. Especially nice that they did Native Linux support that works great on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can find each of them on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan/" target="_blank">Steam</a> (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games" target="_blank">GOG</a> too but they only have the Windows builds).</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creative Assembly and SEGA have released the 2.4.0 version update to Total War: WARHAMMER III and it's quite a big one.</p>
<p>This brings the massive combined campaign Immortal Empires out of Beta and ready for everyone. This is where if you own the previous games, it all gets bundled into one big thing with all of the landmasses, Legendary Lords, war units and more from the Total War: WARHAMMER series into one colossal mode. However, they've now opened this up to all players regardless if you own the previous games or not. They said you can just buy the individual DLC from the previous games if you want to access more from them.</p>

<p>Sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Here some of the other changes in the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Karak Eight Peaks is now a ten-slot settlement for the Skaven... yes-yes...</li>
<li>Malus's quest battle for the Warpstone of Khaine is now in the Chaos Wastes, closer to his starting position.</li>
<li>Fixed a variety of visual/graphical glitches such as clipping capes, snapping models and broken animations.</li>
<li>Garrisons are no longer reinforcements and now enter the battle from the start.</li>
<li>Fixed a multiplayer desync that could occur when an Empire player chose to Summon the Elector Counts.</li>
<li>Coedill will no longer immediately enter the battle instead of reinforcing once the Waystones are destroyed in Drycha's quest battle.</li>
<li>Interrogating Grom the Paunch in Athel Tamarha as Eltharion now correctly gives Mistwalker units the ability to mirror Grom's Big Waaagh ability.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Boris Ursus wouldn't gain supporters while the Invocation of Dazh is active.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For those of you sticking to the Native Linux port from Feral Interactive instead of running it in Proton, there's a bit of a wait ahead. Over email to my question about the update for it they mentioned they don't have a fixed date for the update but it's in the "final stages of development and are aiming at making the Linux update available soon".</p>

      <title>Steam had 83,000 new customers every day in 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3677786186779762808" target="_blank">Steam Year In Review for 2022</a> and while they didn't give us a new monthly active user count, there were plenty of other details shared.</p>
<p>One that's the most striking to me, was the note about how they saw a completely ridiculous <strong><u>83,000</u></strong> "new first-time purchasers every day of the year". That is just absolutely nuts. Steam is clearly stronger than ever and growing at a crazy pace. Valve noted how they crossed over 30 million users online last year too, which was only a year and a half after hitting 20 million for the first time. </p>
<p>What's driving the growth then? The PC (that's Personal Computer — PC <em>doesn't</em> mean Windows) is an open platform and isn't "reliant on any one product or manufacturer" said Valve. Certainly is a benefit as they said anyone can come along with "a beat-up old laptop or a brand new top of the line rig, and plug in any peripheral they want" and with the Steam Deck too of course there's more ways than ever to play.</p>
<p>A lot of the post is just going over things I've reported on across last year like Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> updates, Big Picture Mode, Dynamic Cloud Sync and their regular Steam Input updates. There was also their update to Game Hubs, the new Steam Mobile App and all their new festivals and sales.</p>
<p>When it comes to what's driving people to Steam it was a big mix of established names and new developers too. Of course they have stuff like Call of Duty, Elden Ring and others but they also mentioned how 85 of the top releases during 2022 were from studios releasing their first game — with developers spread across the globe too.</p>
<p>Going along with their growth in customers, they had a lot of downloads too. They said the content delivery increased by "36%" as they served up 44.7 exabytes. To put it into perspective they said that would be the equivalent to having "every one of the 8 billion people on planet Earth downloaded a 5.5 gigabyte game".</p>
<p>Simply incredibly growth. Valve pretty much continue to be a money printing machine. It's hard to imagine but with the 30% cut they take from most developers, that's a whole lot in the bank.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown added Easy Anti-Cheat for Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While no announcement from the developer has been made yet, Hunt: Showdown now has the Easy Anti-Cheat file needed and works on Steam Deck and Linux Desktop.</p>
<p>This is one I certainly didn't expect to start working. However, since there's been no announcement, it could stop working in future. EAC doesn't just get added and turned on like this by accident though.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, it actually works surprisingly well too and even looks pretty good on Low details. To ensure it works, make sure you have installed the Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime from your Steam Library. As it may not be automatically installed and you won't have it unless you've installed something else that did have it automatically set on it.</p>
<p>See some Steam Deck footage below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WVoNLB8lXhM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dedf113cfb4ecf51f421d873d9b2815f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WVoNLB8lXhM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for Desktop Linux, my testing has been on Fedora KDE 37 and it has been a pretty great experience there too. Setting everything up to High on the various presets, using a 1440p resolution with my AMD Ryzen 5800x plus NVIDIA 2080 Ti it's been quite smooth, apart from the usual expected shader cache dips while it gets built up and eventually becomes fully smooth.</p>
<p>I've been generally seeing 90+FPS with everything on High. It runs really very nicely.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. Not a recommendation yet though though due to the mentioned issue of it not being formally announced but thought you would like to know and see it running.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector adds Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector from Black Lab Games and publisher Slitherine released back in 2021, and it just got upgraded for Steam Deck players. </p>
<p>More about it: "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millennium. Pick your force, develop your army, field mighty heroes and fight for victory using superior strategy, awesome abilities, and devastating weaponry."</p>
<p>Never seen it? Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nVsCATpZloc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d20213e2eeef203b4f815cba0d3cc338.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nVsCATpZloc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see developers of all sorts big and small, and all different genres look to make the experience better. Previously it was rated as Unsupported by Valve through their Deck Verified rating system - so hopefully now it can be bumped up at least to Playable or Verified to let potential players know.</p>
<p>As of the latest update version 1.2.43 here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steamdeck support. We’ve made a number of changes to improve the experience when playing on Steam Deck.
<ul>
<li>The game will default to gamepad controls when starting on Steam Deck, fonts should be more readable, the on-screen keyboard should display when required and better v-sync handling for smoother play.</li>
<li>Added support for gamepad controls in some PC-only multiplayer UIs such as tournaments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for chat messages in asynchronous multiplayer matches.</li>
<li>Refactored the system that manages multiplayer turn data exchange to prevent most desyncs.</li>
<li>Enabled V-sync when running on PS5, Xbox One X or Xbox Series X.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Classic city-builder Nebuchadnezzar gets a big free update and DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nebuchadnezzar, a classic isometric city-builder has continued to get some big upgrades with a new release out and an expansion DLC too.</p>
<p>Designed much like the original Pharaoh from 1999, and looks like an upgraded version of it. Initially it struggled at release due to some missing features but the developers at Nepos Games have really pulled it out the bag here. The free 1.4 update adds in: walls to secure your city, warfare, diplomacy improvements, increased map sizes, an update to the original campaign to add in some warfare missions, a colourblind mode and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11748953851676573323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11748953851676573323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of the huge free update they also released Nebuchadnezzar: The Adventures of Sargon DLC. This includes a whole new campaign along with a fully voiced dialogs system for those of you wanting to play through more.</p>
<p>Now rated Very Positive from users on Steam, seems like they've done well with it. Nice to see it continue to be upgraded.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/nebuchadnezzar?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1157220/Nebuchadnezzar/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>AMD releases source code for FidelityFX FSR2 v2.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last year AMD announced FSR version 2.2 and today AMD has actually released the source code on <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2/releases/tag/v2.2.0" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for FidelityFX FSR2 v2.2.</p>
<p>This makes it even easier for any developer and game engine to use it, so hopefully we will begin to see more games implement it to help performance. With this being the first proper public release of FSR 2.2 these are the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of debug API checker.</li>
<li>Changes to improve "High Velocity Ghosting" situations.</li>
<li>Changes to Luminance computation with pre-exposure application.</li>
<li>Small motion vectors ignored in previous depth estimation.</li>
<li>Changes to depth logic to improve disocclusion detection and avoid self-disocclusions.</li>
<li>Dilated reactive mask logic updated to use temporal motion vector divergence to kill locks.</li>
<li>New lock luminance resource.</li>
<li>Accumulation overhauled to use temporal reactivity.</li>
<li>Changed how intermediate signals are stored and tonemapped.</li>
<li>Luminance instability logic improved.</li>
<li>Tonemapping no longer applied during RCAS to retain more dynamic range.</li>
<li>Fixes for multiple user reported issues on GitHub and elsewhere. Thank you for your feedback!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD are announcing another milestone too with 250 games either having FSR or planning to add it in as they showed in a graphic of many game logos. Out of the 250 they said 110 of them will support the latest FSR 2 and they soon expect the number of FSR 2 enabled games to overtake FSR 1.</p>

      <title>Returnal is just rough on Steam Deck but great on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Returnal is now on Steam so naturally I gave this previously PlayStation exclusive a run on Steam Deck. It's quite sad though.</p>
<p>This is a case of a game just being a bit too much for the Steam Deck to nicely handle. With everything set to Low, with multiple in-game scaling methods tried like AMD FSR, NVIDIA NIS and dynamic resolution — all show the game really cannot stick to 30FPS. Frame pacing is all over the place too, making it just an <em>unpleasant</em> experience. You <em>could</em> reduce the rendering resolution but considering how fast paced the game is, the result is not pretty in action and getting it low enough where it makes a true difference is just not acceptable quality-wise.</p>
<p>Have a look at benchmarks and gameplay below:</p>

<p>As for how it runs on Desktop Linux? Testing it on Fedora KDE 37 with my AMD Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti, performance there seems quite good overall. I'm actually really surprised by how smooth it is, I was expecting a lot more stutter but it's impressive.</p>
<p>Running it at 1440p on the Epic settings preset with NVIDIA Image Scaling set to Quality and I've been seeing it running a good ~90FPS. Without using a scaling option, it would give me around 50-55FPS at 1440p. There is <em>some</em> shader stutter but as expected, it gets smoother over time and not a big deal here.</p>

<p>For desktop Linux gamers at least, this looks like quite a safe bet from my early impressions here. It performs well, looks absolutely fantastic and the action sure is intense!</p>

      <title>Shader cache downloads being a nuisance? Valve may have solved it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's shader cache system can be extremely helpful for Linux gaming, however it can also at times be quite problematic but Valve may have solved a big problem with it.</p>
<p>The idea behind the system is that you're supposed to see small regular downloads for the shader cache of each game, as Valve continue to build it up and then spread it out to everyone to help improve game performance on Linux and Steam Deck. However, over the years quite a lot of people have reported how it kept giving full downloads of the whole thing instead of being incremental.</p>
<p>Writing on the GitHub bug report from 2021 today, Valve developer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8076#issuecomment-1430641159" target="_blank">Pierre-Loup Griffais said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shader cache downloads are designed to be incremental. Reports here indicate a daily download of the full shader cache file size, which is inconsistent with expectations - a small download and full disk write is expected instead.</p>
<p>After looking at the logs shared on this issue and on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9200" target="_blank">#9200</a>, we've investigated and found a server-side problem with the system that keeps track of the ordering of shaders in those updates.</p>
<p>We've just rolled out an initial fix and will continue to monitor the situation. If the issue persists, please comment on this report and attach your <code class="inline-code">shader_log[.previous].txt</code> as indicated above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully now fewer people (or no one) will see the issue but do let them know on the bug report if it happens to you.</p>

      <title>Zink driver for OpenGL over Vulkan gets a 10x performance boost for DOOM 2016</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A really small change to the Zink driver, that gives OpenGL support on top of Vulkan, has given an ~10x speed boost for DOOM (2016). Other games are likely to benefit from this change too but DOOM was the one where an issue was noticed.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/CAPPED/" target="_blank">their blog</a> last week, developer Mike Blumenkrantz noted that a really odd issue was found where "Even as early as the title screen, framerate would struggle to hit 30fps for a while before rocketing up to whatever maximum it could reach. In-game was the same, soaring to the 200fps maximum after enough time standing stationary without moving the camera. As soon as the camera shifted however, back to 20fps we went.".</p>
<p>After investigating they found the problem and a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/21218" target="_blank">merge request</a> that was accepted for Mesa that's only around 4 lines has fixed the issue to allow DOOM to run at full-speed on the Zink driver.</p>
<p>Makes me often wonder how many things can be fixed up by such small changes.</p>
<p>What's the point of the Zink driver? As the Mesa documentation states: "The Zink driver is a Gallium driver that emits Vulkan API calls instead of targeting a specific GPU architecture. This can be used to get full desktop OpenGL support on devices that only support Vulkan.".</p>

      <title>You may want to run system updates, after a recent sudo security flaw</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was pointed out to me recently in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>, that the sudo package recently had a security flaw, so time to check for updates.</p>
<p>The sudo package is what's responsible for giving certain users or user groups the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user. A pretty important package, and of course one that needs to be secure. Nothing is perfect though of course, and security issues being reported and then fixed is a good thing.</p>
<p>Going by the US NVD (National Vulnerability Database) <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22809" target="_blank">entry for it</a>, they classed it as a High level issue. As described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a "--" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving that it needs a local attack, it does limit what people can do with it but still a good reminder to ensure your systems are up to date eh?</p>
<p>So if you're on at least sudo 1.9.12p2 you're good to go. Although, some distributions like Ubuntu use slightly different versioning so if you're on Ubuntu you should have 1.9.11p3. Fedora seems up to date too, but checking on System76's Pop!_OS it's only reporting sudo 1.9.9 for example (Edit: but as pointed out in comments, it has the patch as it's based on an older Ubuntu).</p>
<p>You can read a little more on it <a href="https://medium.com/@dev.nest/how-to-bypass-sudo-exploit-cve-2023-22809-vulnerability-296ef10a1466" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>D8VK is an in-progress implementation of Direct3D 8 for DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12 to Vulkan and DXVK for Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation, what about Direct3D 8? <a href="https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk" target="_blank">D8VK</a> is an upcoming in-progress project for that.</p>
<p>I've been aware of this for a while but after checking back on it, the project seems to be coming along rather nicely to support some older classics and get them performing well with Wine / <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. It even had a first pre-release build back in December 2022 and work continues on it now. ProtonUp-Qt even added support for it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/protonup-qt-v277-adds-support-for-northstarproton-to-play-modded-titanfall-2/" target="_blank">previous release</a> too.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk/wiki#supported-games" target="_blank">their list</a> of supported games, it's looking quite impressive on what it can run already but it seems plenty of work is still ahead before it's truly ready. Some of what they list as playable on Linux with it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 Wonders Magical Mystery Tour</li>

      <title>EVERSPACE 2 gets a Steam Deck and Linux release update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you curious on what's happening with EVERSPACE 2 for Linux, ROCKFISH Games have given an official update on what to expect.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/3632752322785384804" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rockfishgames/everspace-2/posts/3732437" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they made it clear that Linux support and Steam Deck are priorities for them to be supported. As they said having it playable "natively on Linux is high on our priority list" although there can always be unforeseen issues as they learned porting the first game to Linux but "overall Unreal Engine 4’s Linux support is in a much better state, now".</p>
<p>However, they're clear that "PC" (they mean Windows…sigh) is their "top priority" right now since it's the biggest set of users and a few weeks will still be spent on Windows players before shifting over to Linux. They're "reasonably confident" on Linux support at the 1.0 launch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u8m47pGxGaM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea606059f206e0a9c60eeffbe5828351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u8m47pGxGaM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for Steam Deck specific support they said they're also hoping for that at the 1.0 release but it's a lot more work due to optimizations needed, and changes needing to be made to the text size and UI for the smaller screen. Plus, Steam Deck was not part of their Kickstarter promises so it's a lower priority. They said trying it on Steam Deck right now is a "pretty OK time" but they want to aim for the experience to be of a higher quality.</p>
<p>If I hear of any changes, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>10 years ago Steam released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm starting to feel old. I remember a time before Steam for Linux, back in the dark days even before the first set of Humble Indie Bundles, it's truly crazy how far Linux has come overall as a platform for gaming. 10 years ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/9943" target="_blank">today</a>, Steam for Linux left Beta and released officially and what a difference it made!</p>
<p>Many issues along the way, a number of missteps from Valve directly too (hello Steam Machines), but we got there in the end didn't we? Linux Gaming is no longer a thing that people will constantly laugh about. It's here, it's a thing and many people now with a Steam Deck likely don't even realise they're using Linux — that's just how good it can be.</p>
<p><em>Life changing of course for me too, GamingOnLinux is my job and 99% of that is thanks to Valve's effort.</em></p>
<p>I'm not going to rehash everything, since I've gone over many milestones before like my previous article <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a> from 2021, which is worth a read if you're somewhat new to Linux gaming (and Steam Deck!).</p>
<p>Happy 10 years, Steam for Linux! Cheers! Here's to the next 10 and many more.</p>
<p>What do you expect over the next 10 years and what have been your favourite moments?</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.27 released with multi-monitor &amp; Wayland upgrades, Steam Deck updater</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma 5.27 sounds like a really great update to this desktop environment, the same one used on the desktop mode for the Steam Deck and my personal choice for my PC too.</p>
<p>Coming in on Valentines Day and the "<a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2023/news-20230104-01.en.html" target="_blank">I Love Free Software Day</a>" (that's apparently a thing?), it brings an absolute ton of enhancements to the desktop experience including a new introduction wizard to guide you through a first time install that might help a few confused users. There's also a window tiling system, updates to app themes, upgrades to the widgets system, adjustments to system settings so it's not so overloaded, Discover now supports full Steam Deck system upgrades and so much more.</p>
<p>KDE Plasma 5.27 is also a Long Term Support release so it will continue to see fixes until some time in 2024 when the next LTS release of Plasma becomes available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6697133811676399250gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6697133811676399250gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-monitor overhaul:</strong> Those of you who use multiple monitors should benefit greatly from a major overhaul of how Plasma handles them. Arrangements will now be more robust, without the chance of panels and desktops getting lost after monitors are unplugged or re-arranged.</li>
<li><strong>Use global shortcuts to run terminal commands:</strong> The <em>Shortcuts</em> page in the <em>System Settings</em> utility now lets you configure keyboard shortcuts not only for apps, but also to launch terminal commands and scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Activate "Do Not Disturb" mode from the command line:</strong> If you spend most of the time in the terminal and are being overwhelmed with notifications, just type <code class="inline-code">kde-inhibit --notifications</code> and Plasma will enter "Do Not Disturb" mode.</li>
<li><strong>Send windows to Activities:</strong> Do you use Activities to compartmentalize your private work, public life, and play time? If so, now you can move or copy windows to one, some or all of your Activities by right-clicking on the titlebar and choosing where you want it to go.</li>
<li><strong>Save power with one keystroke:</strong> While on the lock screen, hit the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to turn off the screen and save some power.</li>
<li><strong>Customized menu entries</strong>. If you like customizing how apps launch, KDE's <em>Menu Editor</em> has always let you set environment variables when opening your apps, but now it's much easier to do so, as Plasma 5.27 gives the editor a specific text box for exactly that purpose.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By far my favourite bit is the focus on multi-monitor support, which has been a real nuisance at times. Looking forward to seeing that in action on both my Desktop and my often-docked Steam Deck. Hopefully now there will be less dancing around to get it to actually remember layouts.</p>
<p>As for when to expect the update? That all depends on what Linux distribution you use for Desktop Linux. For Steam Deck specifically, it will likely come in the next major SteamOS update.</p>

      <title>The new Vampire Survivors update is trippy and pulled me back in</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is back with a brand new update that's real trippy, and also has a little Sonic flavour to it. If you don't hear from me for a week, it's because it's sucked me right back in. Send help.</p>
<p>I'll admit I completely burned out on Vampire Survivors for a while, especially because many other similar games have since come along that in various ways do things better (or just differently in a fun way). However, coming back to it now a few updates later and wow — there's absolutely tons of content in it to play through and unlock now.</p>
<p>Check out their insane new trailer below. Seriously, what madness:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a9REb2CEzV0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1471c28223cb6b0177a40b0168afe1a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a9REb2CEzV0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The mostly spoiler free changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Contains:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 new achievements.</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage.</li>
<li>2 new relics to get a new PowerUp and something special.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Tweaks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Items not necessary for the Queen Sigma unlock have a yellowish background color in Collection.</li>
<li>If you have at least 1M gold, the Eggman appears in Moongolow.</li>
<li>The game should remember the skins you've been using for each character.</li>
<li>"spoopyseason" spell should permanently unlock new skins for Mortaccio, Yatta Cavallo, Bianca Ramba, and O'Sole Meeo.</li>
<li>Added a team member to the credits.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/5662747178708901034" target="_blank">with spoilers here</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux port (although not advertised), and works great on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. They're still working on their big game engine port, which they also previously mentioned would bring proper Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 25: Quantum Axcess </title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-24-mother-knows-best/" target="_blank">Part 24: Mother Knows Best</a></strong></p>
<p>Back when I first played through <em>Quake: The Offering</em> I found that I enjoyed the two mission packs even more than I did the original <em>Quake</em> campaign, and while <em>Scourge of Armagon</em> and <em>Dissolution of Eternity</em> were the only official sanctioned addons sold for <em>Quake</em>, several third party expansions and total conversions exist that also had retail releases. Two of these, <em>Shrak</em> and <em>Malice</em>, were published on CD-ROM in 1997 by Quantum Axcess. </p>
<p>While neither came with Linux specific instructions, the readme.txt file for <em>Malice</em> does at least describe how to get the game working under MacOS, which follows much of the same procedure. After inserting the CD-ROM you need to copy over the malice directory to your <em>Quake</em> installation, which by default can be found at /usr/local/games/quake on Linux. Once done all you need to do is launch <em>Quake</em> using the "-game malice" argument.</p>
<p>Setting up <em>Shrak</em> is more problematic, as the 16-bit MS-DOS application ST.EXE was included with <em>Shrak</em> to combine textures due to concerns over distributing id Software's intellectual property. On Linux this can be dealt with through DOSBox using the manual install instructions found on the <em>Shrak</em> FAQ page. An official update patch is also available for those owning the first CD-ROM pressing of the game. Once all is applied you can launch <em>Quake</em> using the "-game shrak" argument.</p>
<p><em>Malice </em>does introduce some new features that need to be bound to the keyboard using the console, a complete list of which can be found included as part of the MacOS instructions. If you are using OpenGL acceleration you should also delete your old meshes by removing the id1/glquake directory before launching to avoid artifacts. You must also ensure that you give write permissions to the malice and shrak directories to have save files work from your user account.</p>
<p>In addition, a lethal goof exists in <em>Malice</em> where the developers forgot to pack a parachute in the "The Underwater Base" level well into the campaign. The original suggestion from Quantum Axcess was to just to use the fly console command to cheat the level. A patch was later released that provides an alternate D8B.BSP map file, but this needs to be loaded from the console, and oddly enough provides a hoverboard rather than a parachute. It does still do the job at least.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19523804661672956347gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19523804661672956347gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/669924891675811054gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/669924891675811054gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Like with the official mission packs, these total conversions show off a great deal more variety and inventiveness than was found in the main <em>Quake</em> campaign. Of the two <em>Shrak</em> is the more pedestrian, fitting in well alongside the other expansions, introducing a new villain much like Armagon. Even innovations such as the grappling hook and the friend maker are in line with experiments such as the "Horn of Conjuring" or the "Anti-Grav Belt" found in the sanctioned packs.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why <em>Shrak</em> is the more forgotten, with it not even having all of its secret areas documented online until I put in the effort myself. It also has a number of rough edges, with <em>Shrak</em> reverting to showing the final briefing text from <em>Quake</em> at the end. <em>Malice, </em>on the other hand, is something else.<em> Malice</em> feels like if <em>SiN</em> were developed on the original <em>Quake</em> engine; ironic, considering <em>Scourge of Armagon</em> was the first retail product Ritual Entertainment produced.</p>
<p>You play a similar if more brain damaged protagonist, fighting the forces of a large megacorporation in a cyberpunk future. The maps are more dynamic than found in <em>Quake</em>, featuring scripted set pieces and even pilotable vehicles and probes. The enemies are largely hitscanners, most of your weapons now need to be reloaded, and both <em>Malice </em>and <em>SiN</em> even have pistols that can serve as your main reliable. All of this, as well as the bugs brought on by bloated ambition.</p>
<p>By abusing the demo feature in <em>Quake</em> they were even able to add cutscenes to <em>Malice,</em> although the CD music would often overwhelm the dialogue; both total conversions feature all new soundtracks which lean heavier on electronica. I also found while playing either <em>Malice</em> or <em>Shrak</em> that many of the switches would appear too dark when rendered through glquake.glx, but would look fine in software mode. <em>Malice</em> spouts garbage to the console when using OpenGL as well.</p>
<p>Quantum Axcess were far from the only distributor to dip their toes into the waters of unofficial <em>Quake</em> expansion content, with even the sequel <em>Quake II</em> seeing a number of companion CD-ROMs released for use alongside it. Some of those I intend to cover at some point, but I think I have had my fill of <em>Quake</em> again for now. Instead, I have found an old CD-R disc which I am curious to see if it can still be read after all these years. Time to move from rocket jumping to distro hopping.</p>

      <title>Gladiator battling deck-builder Alina of the Arena gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Alina of the Arena looks like a lot of fun if you love your deck-builders, and a recent update should make it a lot better on Steam Deck (and Desktops with a controller). Just recently it was given a Steam Deck Verified rating.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1668690/announcements/detail/3657521891367834743" target="_blank">update</a> from the developer was short, sweet and very much to the point simply noting it has Steam Deck and Controller support now.</p>
<p>With gameplay that's inspired by elements of Slay the Spire and Into the Breach, it ticks a lot of the right boxes for me so I'm looking forward to giving this one a go. You play as a gladiator that must fight for a bloodthirsty crowd to survive, building up a deck of powerful abilities was moving around a hex-based grid to defend and avoid attacks from various different types of enemies.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xqu3cCR_Ybk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab277c6e67e88a8004734d669072df92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xqu3cCR_Ybk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Deckbuilding - Pick up dozens of cards, keep the ones you need, and craft a unique deck as you fight your way through randomized levels that present a different challenge each run!</li>
<li>Hex-based Tactics - Unlike traditional deckbuilders that focus on attack and defense, the tactics element adds a dimension of positioning. Dupe your enemies into attacking each other, or use the terrain to gain an upper hand.</li>
<li>Dual Equipment System - Carry equipment in both hands to enhance your cards! You can dual wield daggers for extra damage, go with a sword &amp; shield combo for rounded performance, or wreak havoc with a two-handed weapon. Figure out the best combination for each fight!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1668690/Alina_of_the_Arena/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Have plenty of free time? Check out the new Double Fine documentary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a lot of time free and love Double Fine games, especially Psychonauts 2? Good news, there's a multi-hour documentary now available.</p>
<p>Coming from 2 Players Productions, it encompasses six years and thousands of hours of footage cut down into an interesting little mini-series documentary about game development. Certainly worth a watch to get a bit more of the info behind the scenes. As described: "2 Player Productions and Double Fine Productions present Double Fine PsychOdyssey, an unprecedented documentary experience seven years in the making.</p>
<p>Ten years after the release of their flagship video game Psychonauts, Double Fine Productions returns to its most celebrated franchise with Psychonauts 2. Now facing the pressure to produce a worthy sequel, the studio must confront overly ambitious designs, poor morale, technical challenges and financial woes, all during a turbulent span of time for the world.</p>
<p>Double Fine PsychOdyssey is the direct continuation of the acclaimed series Double Fine Adventure, and offers even deeper insight into the passion, humor, and heartbreak of video game development."</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>

<p>Watch the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_" target="_blank">series on YouTube</a>, it's also hosted on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Double_Fine_PsychOdyssey" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>It's long, like really long. Something to watch over a week perhaps?</p>

      <title>itch.io has a &#39;Trans Witches are Witches&#39; bundle that&#39;s raised over $90K</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://itch.io/b/1712/trans-witches-are-witches" target="_blank">The Trans Witches are Witches bundle</a> is live on itch.io featuring 69 items from various LGBTQ+ creators, aimed at rejecting "Hogwarts Legacy's bigotry". A good way for people to support creators if you're deciding not to pick up Hogwarts Legacy. </p>
<p>With it you get access to an assortment of games, game assets, zines, various TTRPG stuff and more. It costs $60 but they also have a separate <a href="https://itch.io/b/1713/trans-witches-are-witches-apprentice-edition" target="_blank">$10 version</a> too for people who don't have as much to spare.</p>
<p>One of the fun little standouts is <a href="https://magictrick.itch.io/magic-trick" target="_blank">Magic Trick</a>, "a skateboarding adventure game about community! As the new WizKid in town, perform magic using rad skating combos, explore the whimsical city, and socialize with your wacky new neighbors who could use more magic in their lives!".</p>
<p>Everything included is related to the magic world in some way, as the clear theme here is for magic fans who don't wish to support the new Hogwarts Legacy for various reasons, but the controversy hasn't stopped the game from becoming a huge seller on Steam and one of the all-time biggest releases. For those of you who don't understand what's going on and why the Harry Potter universe is problematic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1iaJWSwUZs" target="_blank">this video</a> can shed some light on bits of it. The bundles have links to various issues with the Hogwarts Legacy game too.</p>
<p>The bundle runs until February 24th and has already raised over $90,000 with both versions of the bundle together.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania releasing March 6th with new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is shaping up to be the most exciting content expansion to Dead Cells yet and we don't have long to wait now as it's releasing March 6th. Are you as excited as I am? I might have to give the Netflix Anime a second run-through…</p>
<p>In the new trailer they said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3655268188659289097" target="_blank">announcement</a> you're only seeing about "5%" of what it has to offer, and they'll have 51 of the original Castlevania tracks in this DLC, with 12 reimagined by their own musician in their Dead Cells style. Anyway, check out the first proper trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QBBwIHYm8Mw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/35a610ad00c10bb51497518ef4798e13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QBBwIHYm8Mw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:start">What the DLC will come with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Weapons: </strong>Unlock 14 iconic weapons such as the Vampire Killer, Throwing Axe &amp; Holy Water to decimate Dracula's bestiary of monsters and finally the dark lord himself. Each item has been translated into the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells while keeping their original essence.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Dracula's Castle: </strong>Secret rooms. Flame-lit corridors. Gloomy tombs. Beautiful paintings. Food hidden in the walls. Full of original monsters from the series, such as harpies, werewolves &amp; haunted armors, the character of the iconic castle will transport you into the realms of gothic fantasy.</li>
<li><strong>Classic and Reimagined Music: </strong>We're giving you access to an alternative soundtrack made of 51 of the original Castlevania tunes, that can be heard across the entire game. Yes, 51! On top of this, we've taken the 12 most iconic tracks, such as Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears and Simon Belmont's Theme, and reimagined them in the style of Dead Cells as a soundtrack for this DLC, while preserving the Castlevania ambiance of course.</li>
<li><strong>A New Story:  </strong>Richter Belmont and Alucard will be by your side throughout your quest to vanquish Dracula, helping you to navigate the maze of Dracula’s Castle and providing you with strong weapons (sometimes willingly, sometimes not). However, where there is good there is evil, so watch out for powerful foes who will try everything in their power to stop you from reaching the throne room.</li>
<li><strong>Three Boss Fights: </strong>Fight against the very essence of evil in two intense duels versus Death and Dracula, both set against a majestic backdrop. If you can survive these gauntlets, prepare yourself for our most ambitious boss showdown yet...</li>
<li><strong>Castlevania Outfits: </strong>Unlock 20 outfits as you progress through the castle, letting you roleplay as all your favourite characters like Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades or even Dracula himself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified (and really does work great).</p>
<p>Additionally, they've teamed up with Scorpion Masqué to do a real board game which will head to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scorpionmasque/dead-cells-the-rogue-lite-board-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> later this year.</p>

      <title>Neon-smashing one-button arcade game Ding Dong XL gets improved for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released back in 2018, the one-button arcade game Ding Dong XL from Adamvision Studios that has an Overwhelmingly Positive Steam user rating gets upgraded ready for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It already had a Native Linux version, so this was mainly the developer testing and ensuring it all looks and works well on the Steam Deck directly. They also noted only the 64bit Linux version was updated as they weren't sure if the 32bit build was even needed (it's really not).</p>
<p>Here's what they noted had changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated to a newer Unity Engine version.</li>
<li>Fixed a bunch of minor reported bugs.</li>
<li>Adjusted some particle effects to be less performance draining.</li>
<li>Added the internal leaderboards menu (and kept link to Steam full menu).</li>
<li>Updated the Adamvision logo splash, no more bright white screen, this is the future.</li>
<li>Made some changes to ensure compatibility on Steam Deck, tested and confirmed working great :).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Never played it before myself but certainly looks like one of those games I wouldn't be able to put down if I started it. Looks really easy to get into, see the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Steam and Steam Deck Stable client update released fixing up lots of bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After another short Beta period, Valve recently released another stable Steam Client update for Desktop and Steam Deck and here's what's new. Largely the same between the two, since of course they share a lot of the code and the Big Picture UI now. Some of the fixes are just cleaning up not sending people on Desktop to Steam Deck areas.</p>
<p>These are noted for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3673284490061606420" target="_blank">Steam Deck changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced startup time for users with tens of thousands of games in their library.</li>
<li>The Virtual Keyboard in the Overlay now remembers its last position.</li>
<li>Added settings for initial location to show keyboard on desktop and in Steam overlay.</li>
<li>Added fast jump by letter to library.</li>
<li>Fixed Chord Hint Screen remaining shown after holding the guide button to turn off a controller in some scenarios.</li>
<li>Fixed small movement of Virtual Keyboard when pressing shift in some themes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some inputs not showing up for the Steam Link App Touchscreen controller.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of Left Bumper/Trigger glyphs having the wrong background image.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where a Team Fortress 2 Steam Controller startup sound was missing.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Nintendo switch gyro drift calibration.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverted back to old Game Info dialog that is accessible from the Friends List.</li>
<li>Added alt-enter as a hotkey to exit Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture Mode window not re-opening from double-clicking or selecting system tray menu options.</li>

<li>Fixed issue where exiting Big Picture Mode would log out of Steam Chat.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when opening Steam store.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam library becoming unusable after applying a controller configuration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While these are noted as just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3682291689318547909" target="_blank">Desktop Steam fixes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a cause of Steam library, chat and Big Picture Mode browser windows showing all black or not rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed crash on startup when an internal Steam browser window fails creation.</li>
<li>Added F11 as a hotkey to toggle between windowed and fullscreen (Big Picture).</li>
<li>Added fast jump by letter to BPM library.</li>
<li>Added settings option to enable/disable UI sounds.</li>
<li>Removed UI that prompted users if they wanted to participate in the Steam Deck Verified program when in normal BPM.</li>
<li>Report a Bug in the Quick Access menu now links to the Big Picture discussions instead of the Steam Deck discussions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Death Corp makes you an intern at the Grim Reaper&#39;s company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Getting a job is tough but college graduate Art was lucky enough to catch the eye of the Grim Reaper. Hold on, does the Grim Reaper even have eyes? Currently in development with a full release planned early next year, some might recognise the artwork from Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack, with the animator on it now pursuing their own game with Death Corp.</p>
<p>More about it from the dev: "Let's start with an intern position...You play as Art, a young college graduate looking for his first serious job. After a series of unsuccessful interviews, the Grim Reaper itself materializes in front of Art's eyes and, impressed by the young man's skills, offers him a job as an intern at his own company, Death Corp.</p>
<p>Meet tons of ridiculous characters, harvest the souls of those who recently passed away and, sometimes, push forward fate by solving outrageous and hilarious puzzles. Dark humor painted in bright colors scenes divided in independent chapters with constant references to films, books and classic point and click games."</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic 2D point-and-click adventure (just the way you like it!).</li>
<li>A wicked story full of fantasy and humor.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn backgrounds, characters, and interface!</li>
<li>Mixed of frame by frame and skeletal animations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a Native Linux demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146280/Death_Corp/" target="_blank">Steam</a> you can try right now, plus it's also crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deathcorp/death-corp-point-and-click-adventure/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> so for fans of point and click adventures it's your chance to help another release happen.</p>

      <title>Surprisingly BioShock Infinite got an update to fix it launching on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently the Native Linux port of BioShock Infinite was updated to fix it failing to launch after an update.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder — back in September last year 2K <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/various-bioshock-games-get-a-2k-launcher-calling-it-a-quality-of-life-update/" target="_blank">updated various BioShock games</a> to have their own launcher, because we all know gamers love extra launchers don't they? The previous article lists workarounds for them on Linux but as a side-effect they also broke the old Native Linux version.</p>
<p>It's taken over five months to sort it but they finally released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/8870/view/3641758659211388390" target="_blank">update</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our last patch to BioShock Infinite on Steam was intended only for Windows but unexpectedly affected shared dependencies with the Linux version that made the game unplayable on some versions of Linux. We’ve since identified and fixed those conflicts and have verified those solutions addressed the issue in Linux (Ubuntu 22.10). We apologize for the inconvenience to our fans on Linux and appreciate their patience as we worked on a fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I checked on it and the Native Linux port launches fine now on Fedora.</em></p>
<p>Nice to see they finally did something, even though you <em>could</em> workaround it with Proton. For some it seems the Native Linux version actually works better though. I'm just surprised they actually fixed it, I was half expecting them to just leave it and tell people to use Proton at this point.</p>

      <title>Like a Dragon: Ishin! gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and SEGA are bringing Like a Dragon: Ishin! to Steam, and the good news is that it is already Steam Deck Verified. Originally released back in 2014, this is actually a remake. This will released on February 21st, with people who pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition getting early access on February 17th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20039436271676043397gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20039436271676043397gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Centuries of peace are coming to an end. Across the nation, factions assemble in anticipation of civil war.<br/>
Imperial loyalists unite under the banner of “sonno joui”—revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians. They fight to overthrow Japan's military dictatorship and shut its borders to foreign influence.<br/>
Meanwhile, the ruling government, the Bakufu, has assigned special police forces to maintain order—provided they can manage to coexist without drawing blades on one another.<br/>
And in the capital city of Kyo, a man who will change the course of history seeks justice... and revenge.</p>
<p>Sakamoto Ryoma.</p>
<p>Accused of murdering someone he holds dear, this lowly samurai from a backwater land renounces his name and goes into hiding. To find the true killer's identity, Ryoma must conceal himself among the wolves of the infamous Shinsengumi.<br/>
Taking the alias Saito Hajime, it isn't long before he winds up embroiled in the political schemes and savage violence that will reshape the country—and give rise to legends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Steam Page:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8977419441676043064gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8977419441676043064gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: The Steam Deck Verified notice from Steam.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully there won't be any issues at release and Valve has thoroughly tested it, as there is a small but growing list of Verified titles that really <em>shouldn't</em> be.</p>
<p>See the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bh83wVDmUcI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48600c2700b99c1df2d416cf18218728.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bh83wVDmUcI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A word of warning though, it's another game to come with the dreaded Denuvo, which can cause problems when switching between PC and Steam Deck, especially so if you mess with different versions of Proton as it can detect each as a new PC and end up locking you out of the game.</p>
<p>I'll admit something to you: I've not actually played any of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon games. Am I missing something big here?</p>
<p>You can get it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/like-a-dragon-ishin?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805480/Like_a_Dragon_Ishin/" target="_blank"> Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Scan UK to offer SSD upgrades compatible with Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the company Framework <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/framework-begin-offering-2tb-ssd-upgrades-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">announced their plans</a> to supply people in the USA and Canada with 2TB SSDs compatible with the Steam Deck but for people in the UK, Scan may be a good option.</p>
<p>Scan have listed a <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/products/1tb-sabrent-rocket-22x30-nvme-pcie-40-x4-m2-ssd-phison-3d-tlc-nand-4750mb-s-read-4300mb-s-write450k" target="_blank">Sabrent Rocket 2230 1TB NVMe</a>, which they plan to release on February 27th for £159.49 and you can pre-order it now. On their listing, they even mention Steam Deck as one of the compatible uses for the SSD, so it's good to see more stores begin to offer this tiny storage option.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21415279781676041029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21415279781676041029gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Shopping around a bit, this does seem like a reasonable price as I've seen it going for quite a lot more across other stores. You could look to the likes of Ebay, AliExpress and more you never quite know what you're going to get (if they even turn up at all) so it's nice to see more legit sources with somewhat reasonable prices begin to show and over time we should see more of it, and see prices drop, just like we do with other types of SSDs.</p>

      <title>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck Beta reduces startup time, fixes more bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck users on the Beta update branch, as another update is out now. Especially good for those of you who somehow have amassed tens of thousands of games.</p>
<p>I thought I was pushing it a bit with 2,600 but some people really have tens of thousands huh? How would you actually pick anything to play? I'm often paralysed by choice with what I have.</p>
<p>Anyway…here's what's changed for both:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Reduced startup time for users with tens of thousands of games in their library.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed small movement of Virtual Keyboard when pressing shift in some themes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam input</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed issue where a Team Fortress 2 Steam Controller startup sound was missing.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Nintendo switch gyro drift calibration.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed Control-1/Control-2 hotkeys not working in Big Picture Mode (Linux specific).</p>
</li>
<li>Reverted back to old Game Info dialog that is accessible from the Friends List.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when opening Steam store.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam library becoming unusable after applying a controller configuration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While these changes seem specific to the Desktop Steam Client:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash on startup when an internal Steam browser window fails creation.</li>
<li>Added settings option to enable/disable UI sounds.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve promise a proper big Team Fortress 2 update is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wait, what year is it? Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming. Valve announced a proper big update is planned and on the way for Team Fortress 2. Yes really.</p>
<p>It's so big they're claiming it's going to be a "full-on update-sized update". They skipped over announcing it on Twitter and instead decided to actually post an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/TF2/announcements/detail/3669906790333865368" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the TF2 Steam Page copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Workshop Creators, can we have your attention please. The following message is <em>so</em> urgent, <em>so</em> time-sensitive, we made the executive decision to skip TikTok and Twitter entirely and break the glass on the most bleeding-edge communication technology available.</p>
<p>Welcome to the future. Welcome… to a "blog-post".</p>
<p>"Wow!" you're probably thinking. "I forgot how hard reading is!" Yeah, it's scary how fast you lose that. Don't worry, we'll be brief:</p>
<p>The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates. But <em>this</em> year, we're planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update — with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!</p>
<p>So get to work! (Or back to work, if you were already working but got distracted when the entire internet simultaneously found out about this state-of-the-art blog-post.) Make sure to get your submissions into the Steam Workshop by May 1st, so they can be considered for this as-yet-unnamed, un-themed, but still very exciting summer-situated (but not summer-themed) (unless you wanted to develop summer-themed stuff) update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally released in 2007, it remains as one of the most played games on Steam (over 100,000 on it right now), although it has seen various massive bot attack problems over the last few years that Valve attempted to address across a number of smaller updates. It's nice to see they're getting back on track here, after previously releasing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/team-fortress-2-update-adds-vscript-and-you-can-now-run-linux-inside-it/" target="_blank">big scripting update</a> to make it more of a modders playground.</p>

      <title>Framework begin offering 2TB SSD upgrades for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a Steam Deck and want to upgrade the internal storage? You're not alone and plenty already have, but getting one compatible isn't exactly easy so Framework have decided to jump in.</p>
<p>For those who don't know them, Framework made their name by creating the Framework Laptop, designed to last with components that can be easily swapped out and upgraded. Seems like quite a natural fit for them to offer up easy upgrades for other devices don't you think?</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/now-offering-2tb-ssds-for-steam-deck-in-the-framework" target="_blank">their blog</a> they said:</p>

<p>You may be thinking “what?” but we spotted an interesting opportunity to enable upgrades on another popular consumer electronics product: the Steam Deck. We have the first batch of these available in the Marketplace today in the US and Canada, and are exploring stocking them for Europe and Australia as well. Unlike the 2280-sized M.2 SSDs that the Framework Laptop uses, the handheld Steam Deck relies on the physically smaller but less common 2230 format. As a result, it can be difficult to find legitimate sources for larger capacity drives like 2TB ones to load all of those games that you’re totally going to play someday. Since we order a huge number of Western Digital drives already, it’s relatively easy for us to add one more line item and stock 2TB SN740 2230 ones. You can follow the guide from our friends at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+SSD+Replacement/148989" target="_blank">iFixit</a> to perform the upgrade. You can also use these drives in many Surface laptops and tablets. We’re continuing to search for ways to help you with hard-to-find upgrades for other products, so let us know if there is anything we should focus on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find them in the US and Canada on <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/products/western-digital-sn740-nvme-m-2-2230" target="_blank">their Marketplace</a>. For USA it's $299 and Canada it's $399.</p>
<p>If they do announce availability elsewhere like the EU / UK, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Thief-like stealth game The Dark Mod v2.11 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love the old first-person stealth game Thief? The Dark Mod was inspired by it and there's a new release out. Free, open source and a lot of fun to be had with many missions available to download.</p>
<p>While it is a game, it's also a complete toolkit for fans to make their own stealth missions and there's already <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/missions/" target="_blank">tons available</a>. Out of the box it doesn't really come with anything, except two example missions and a tutorial so it's up to you to seek out more content for it — although the built-in downloader can take care of that for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18380952251675954886gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18380952251675954886gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developers mentioned version 2.11 is mostly about fixing up bugs, however some new features were sprinkled in too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stealth Score and AI Alert behaviour was much improved.</li>
<li>Smoother transitions from climbing.</li>
<li>A multi-looting feature to grab multiple items at a time.</li>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>
<li>Improved graphics for shadows and volumetric lighting.</li>
<li>The Engine now supports Obj model format (good for modders).</li>
<li>GUI scripting has been overhauled with better syntax and error reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the full release <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/posts/the-dark-mod-2-11-has-been-released/" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>The new System Shock remake demo runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After going through development hell and being long delayed, Nightdive Studios have put up a fresh demo of their System Shock remake that includes controller support and a new intro.</p>
<p>To actually play it on Linux / Steam Deck, you do need to go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu and force Proton, as they've left up a seemingly old Linux launch config that's just empty and downloads nothing. It's unclear if they will still be doing a Native Linux version or not.</p>
<p>Giving it a run on Steam Deck and I was very surprised, I was expecting a game like this to really not perform well at all given that it's a demo of an unfinished game but even on Medium details for the most part it runs shockingly great. They still need to work on the new controller support some more, as the acceleration and sensitivity on thumb-stick is wildly off but it's a good start. Check out my video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y4HxnEVoMf0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/36d8499035afe1167f54af6b109ed271.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y4HxnEVoMf0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In regards to how it runs on Desktop Linux, testing it out also on Fedora 37 (KDE spin) it also runs there very nicely too on maximum settings. On both there's some shader cache stutter at certain points, but really it's not bad at all and at least on desktop the blips in framerate are tiny while it does it.</p>
<p>Still not sold on the game yet. While the world certainly looks nice and seems interesting, I'm going to need a lot more time with it. The combat, especially melee, felt quite poor and hard to judge when you're going to actually hit something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7083330291675942147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7083330291675942147gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - System Shock on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>As long as you force it to Proton so it actually downloads, it seems you're good to go.</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/482400/System_Shock/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 gets a first Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game developers might want to begin to look closer at this one! The free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> is about to have the biggest update ever with 4.0 that now has a first Release Candidate. Since it's such a massive overhaul it would be close to impossible to list everything that has changed since Godot 3.x!</p>
<p>Just a small slice of what's actually new includes: Vulkan support, sky shaders, a big upgrade to their GDScript language, upgraded .NET for C# scripting, big improvements to importing and exporting assets, lots of improvements to accessibility within the game engine editor, AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution (FSR) support, a volumetric fog effect was added, a new global illumination system, an improved and refreshed physics system and the list just keeps on going for quite some time.</p>
<p>Right now their focus is set firmly on fixing up issues and making sure it's truly release ready, so no more new features will be pulled in until Godot 4.1.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2531578531675873451gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2531578531675873451gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Godot 4.0 RC1 on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully the 4.0 release, and then 4.1 after will keep pulling more people over to this FOSS game engine, rather than getting stuck with proprietary lock-in from Unreal, Unity, Game Maker and other popular game engines.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-0-rc-1/" target="_blank">their blog post</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms adds the start of a campaign mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms is a free and open source game pack made with the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> game engine, the bundles together forces from various classic Westwood RTS games including Allies, Soviets, Nod, GDI and the Scrin.</p>
<p>Bringing them all together with elements taken from Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 and Generals along with new units and support powers. It just had a big version 0.90 release that upgraded the OpenRA game engine used, along with the first part of their unique planned single-player campaign to play through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19261743591675866301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19261743591675866301gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - playing as the Scrin, Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Highlights of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First three chapters of single-player campaign (15 missions).</li>
<li>New sidebar/command bar UI.</li>
<li>Added MultiQueue lobby option (each production structure has its own queue).</li>
<li>Added CA music tracks via content download. Added missing Aftermath/Counterstrike music.</li>
<li>65 new maps, including all maps from RAGL seasons 12 and 13, and a bunch of team game maps.</li>
<li>Engine update (improved performance and many bug fixes).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1BiFYv1Zf2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e09017fa6f6fd1cb052a90207cb13bc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1BiFYv1Zf2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I absolutely love this. OpenRA has done a huge service to the RTS gaming community and after growing up playing the likes of Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert I definitely appreciate it. Having all the sides together in such a way is quite fun too! Nice to see it continue to get even better.</p>
<p>Plus absolutely tons of smaller changes that can be seen on their <a href="https://github.com/Inq8/CAmod/releases/tag/0.90" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Callisto Protocol got a Steam Deck upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Callisto Protocol, the horror game that was inspired by Dead Space, has recently gained a hardcore mode and a dedicated Steam Deck upgrade too.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1544020/view/3671032056808752461" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they mentioned this for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated font rendering and UI elements for readability.</li>
<li>Created a rendering functionality profile specifically for Steam Deck with the best settings for smooth gameplay.</li>
<li>Updated control schemes for SteamDeck controls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So I decided to give it a re-look since it's had the above, plus a few other performance upgrades since the release that I was hoping would make it a better experience. Overall, it is a lot better than it was but it can still be a little on the problematic side. </p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what this "rendering functionality profile" even does. There's no special Steam Deck preset, and they're now hiding the benchmark mode specifically on Steam Deck too — which is just odd (it shows up normally on Fedora Linux on my desktop). It's now really close to being properly playable at 30FPS out of the box, still just not quite there but at least now it's somewhat enjoyable, as the drops it still has aren't as painfully dramatic as before.</p>
<p>You can see the full first chapter of the game on Steam Deck below:</p>

<p>It's possible that YouTube might end up putting it behind an age gate, so find the <a href="https://youtu.be/FifuHvPGLVw" target="_blank">direct video link here</a>. </p>

      <title>Zelda-lite classic Anodyne gets a much upgraded fan remake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anodyne from Analgesic Productions recently celebrated a <a href="https://blog.analgesic.productions/posts/2023-02-04-Anodyne-10th-Anniversary" target="_blank">10th anniversary</a>, and the community delivered in style with a full fan remake for modern platforms thanks to the previous source code release. The original is not open source but "source available", since it has a custom license with the new fan remake available under the same licensing.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this unique Zelda-lite game, explore and fight your way through surreal and creepy, nature, urban and abstract themed areas in the human Young's subconscious, evoked by a 16-bit-era visual style and a moody, dream-like soundtrack. Talk to bizarre characters and survive through Game Boy-styled dungeons, while hunting down mysterious keys and cards that will allow you to dive deeper into the dream world."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7816379491675858665gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7816379491675858665gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Anodyne Fan Remake on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>An overview of the changes in the Anodyne Fan Remake includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Render at 60 FPS using OpenGL, effects are done using shaders instead of CPU-side computation</li>
<li>Controller support
<ul>
<li>Switch Pro controller support needs Steam to be active to work correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indicator of currently selected broom in top left of the screen
<ul>
<li>Swapping between brooms doesn't require using the menu - PgUp/Dwn and controller shoulder buttons switch between them, 1-4 sets the current broom directly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unopened chest indicator on minimaps on screens you've visited. No more searching for that one chest in the entire dungeon you missed</li>
<li>Minimap shows floor numbers for multi-floor dungeons</li>
<li>Return to entrance now returns you to the screen where you entered the dungeon (most notable in REDCAVE with its multiple entrances)</li>
<li>Several bugfixes for softlocks and non-essential glitches (wiggle glitch is still in, have fun!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the changes, it can work nicely out of the box on modern systems instead of the ancient and unsupported Adobe tech. I've tested it working great on Fedora Linux (see screenshot above) and also working just fine on Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it in action on Steam Deck where just like desktop Linux it works great:</p>

<p><em>Playing this in bed will really bring back memories of doing the same with the original Game Boy that I had. </em></p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Splittown gets a new Linux demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splittown is an upcoming point and click adventure about the Cold War, where the world is split in two and now there's a Linux demo. Their plan to release this was noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/point-and-click-adventure-splittown-linux-support/" target="_blank">a previous article</a>, where the developer reached out to me after for some pre-release testing and it was looking great!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cold War has split the world in two, both figuratively and literally. The Great Divide spans across the globe with an impenetrable mess of concrete and barbed wire sandwiched between the two blocs. You are Leonard Nimby; stone-faced former top agent of IM5, hot on the trail of a shrink gun stolen from you by a villanous mayoral candidate on the eve of a fateful election.<br/>
<br/>
Splittown is a point-and-click adventure game inspired by 90s classics such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road. You'll crack confounding puzzles, stuff improbable amounts of items in your pockets, and engage in humorous dialogue with a colorful cast of characters on an adventure that will push your wits to the limit.</p>

      <title>Interior Worlds is an upcoming weird spooky liminal space photography game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A slightly spooky and weird exploration game about taking snaps, Interior Worlds seems interesting and it's coming to Linux too. Speaking to the developer, they noted Linux support will come slightly after the Windows release.</p>
<p>I don't think I can even begin to properly describe this one so I'll leave it to the developer: "Welcome to Interior Worlds; an ambient and unsettling first-person exploration game where you'll dive into strange, yet familiar spaces. Temporary gaps and portals we cross at some point or another - now yearning for a closer look. A look that can only be seen properly through the lens of an SLR camera."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mSHPkTUvMSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78c17789b60e22d9c1bc5ee85dc89a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mSHPkTUvMSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your vintage and mysterious analog camera to capture stunning photographs of environmental anomalies throughout each space. Keep a sharp eye out while traversing the more... ominous locations.</li>
<li>Track and share your own in-game catalog of photos, timestamped and pre-filtered with subtle layers of maximum liminal crust.</li>
<li>Ten unique thresholds to traverse. A roadside hotel, empty movie theater, dying mall, and many more. Every environment is hand-crafted in a loving throwback to late 90's and early 00's graphics.</li>
<li>A multitude of ways to capture photos. Adjust zoom levels, increase/decrease lens focus, tilt left/right for a dutch angle, and more. Create perturbing compositions in hundreds of ways.</li>
<li>Unparalleled interactivity. Activate vending machines, phones, sinks, televisions, or simply turn the lights on or off for a different photo-moment vibe.</li>
<li>Immersive and unsettling soundscape. Melt into an eerie mix of low, rumbling drones and soft, stretched pads during the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Something you might find interesting? </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207970/Interior_Worlds/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> with a release coming in March.</p>

      <title>Trackmania is looking great on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackmania has released on Steam recently and thanks to the recent Ubisoft Connect <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-deck-linux-proton-7-0-6-ea-ubisoft/" target="_blank">fixes from Valve in Proton 7.0-6</a>, Trackmania works great on Steam Deck. It's free to play and has in-game purchases for the full content, however you can play rather a lot without spending a penny.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lCyUBmG40h4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5666bc06dd088a70f2b22b8ae0b29bb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lCyUBmG40h4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Desktop Linux users, I've also been testing it on Fedora and it works just great there too. At 1440p it will always stay above 60FPS on max details on my Ryzen 5800x + NVIDIA 2080Ti, most of the time at least ~90FPS but it does heavily depend on the map being played. Some maps are nothing on system resources, others can bring it down a fair bit.</p>
<p>A few dips when it needs to compile a shader that doesn't happen again on a second run, nothing too severe though. Overall, quite happy with the performance myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16655067461675792877gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16655067461675792877gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This really does bring back some memories of playing the first game so long ago.</p>

      <title>Customizable platform fighter Fraymakers is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some really slick animations, the customizable platform fighter Fraymakers has launched in Early Access on Steam with Linux support. It went into Early Access on January 19th that somehow I forgot about, even though I purchased it and played it — woops. I'm only human right?</p>
<p>Following the success of the Kickstarter that back in 2020 that gave them $364,922 in funding (before taxes and expenses ate into it that is), it's nice to see it out and so far it's showing plenty of potential. Some of the key selling points on this is the varied cast of indie game characters, along with the custom content creation system that you can easily download extras for in the Steam Workshop.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cW8oNo1hbmw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72c8608223e4f193f97eafdb2d54e732.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cW8oNo1hbmw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> - Fraymakers is designed to be friendly to new players and challenging and expressive for veteran players. You’re going to have a ton of fun whether you want a quick round with your friends or you’re looking to climb the leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback Netcode</strong> - If you’ve been part of the fighting game community over the past few years, you know that rollback is the gold standard for fighting game netcode. We’ve prioritized and designed around rollback from the outset of development, meaning that Fraymakers will provide the smoothest possible online experience.</li>
<li><strong>Full Movesets</strong> - With over 80 animations per character, we've skipped nothing! Each character comes complete with every motion and attack you've come to expect from a platform fighter as well as some brand new techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Assists</strong> - Choose from a massive selection of indie characters to unleash an attack, fire a projectile, buff your character, or inflict a special status effect on your foes.</li>
<li><strong>...And Infinite Expandability!</strong> - We designed both the game and our custom content editor to be accessible and powerful. We want the process of creating your own content to be simple and fun. Whether you're a player or a creator, this means that the possibilities are endless.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's already a good amount of extra content being loaded up in the Steam Workshop, someone even added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928636648&amp;searchtext=" target="_blank">Trunks</a> from Dragon Ball Z which I naturally had to try out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6471494231675790847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6471494231675790847gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So far at least on Desktop Linux (Fedora) it works quite well. Controller support is a little odd, as sometimes my controller needs a good minute and some button mashing before it's actually detected, and other times the vibration won't stop for a while. The usual expected Early Access release bugs. </p>
<p>Looks fantastic though, the official characters have some gorgeous style and animations done on them, I only hope the developers can keep up the progress on it now it has people wanting more.</p>

      <title>Colony builder Maia gets big optimizations, along with controller and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A name I've not heard for a while that I seemed to miss some emails on recently. Colony building sim Maia, from developer Simon Roth, had a rather <em>big</em> upgrade. This is the first major update since early in 2021.</p>
<p>Some major new features were added to the game including: an entirely new mini-map system to let you get a glimpse of your colony, controller support and big optimizations to performance to help lower end devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N0J-ykZbos8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9d788102b19967902b0225a7b9b5aaf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N0J-ykZbos8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a shader issue with AMD GPU driver support that was stopping the game from running for some users.</li>
<li>Pause button on keyboard now rebindable.</li>
<li>Fix for colonists trying to make small adjustments whilst running causing them to abruptly come to a half and then start running again.</li>
<li>Upgraded SDL support.</li>
<li>Objective flashing animation improved.</li>
<li>Rain textures and animation improved.</li>
<li>Grid simulation no longer shows invalid values on energy storage devices when the game is paused.</li>
<li>Lava simulation optimised and threading removed to prevent crashes. (Full lava rewrite postponed due to complexity)</li>
<li>Colonists will now prioritise the meteor pickups in the second level of the campaign.</li>
<li>Massively reduced the constraint iterations on the cloth simulations to improve CPU performance when the player has lots of flags.</li>
<li>Fix for incorrect light colour in Radiation Containment room.</li>
<li>Protobird sleep behaviour fixed to stop it running automatically into groom behaviour.</li>
<li>Capsules landing will no longer set the ground on fire if the ground is covered in snow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It has a Native Linux version but the developer recommended Proton (specifically GE-Proton) for playing on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>While the game has struggled over the years to find an audience, and deal with some of the more problematic parts of the AI, it's nice to see such an interesting take on a colony builder still continue to be improved many years later.</p>
<p>You can buy Maia on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252250/Maia/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and also <a href="https://machinestudios.itch.io/maia" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Star Wars Dark Forces source port The Force Engine adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Force Engine is a free and open source game engine reimplementation for Star Wars Dark Forces, with upcoming support of Outlaws. The latest release version 1.08 adds Linux support!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2173915321675772984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2173915321675772984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's changed in the 1.08 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed "activated" to "toggle" to better match existing cheat messages.</li>
<li>Fixed a HOM issue in Executor.</li>
<li>Added a proper FPS counter which can be enabled in the graphics menu.</li>
<li>Renamed "energy" to "battery power".</li>
<li>Official Linux support added.</li>
<li>Updated the README with Linux build and run instructions.</li>
<li>Removed the unique 3DO model limit.</li>
<li>Fixed font rendering bugs (lack of language-specific symbols) due to using signed 8-bit characters instead of unsigned.</li>
<li>Dark Forces menu shortcuts now work correctly for different languages.</li>
<li>Fixed the Gamorrean Guard attack delay - they were attacking much more often than in vanilla.</li>
<li>Fixed the Sewer Creature attack and search delays, they were slightly longer than vanilla (meaning it attacked less often than it should have).</li>
<li>Midi selection in the Sound menu now works correctly.</li>
<li>The Escape menu now uses the correct palette, fixing issues with some languages and mods.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when a WAX did not have the appropriate animation in certain areas of the AI code.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it seems Linux users need to build it from source and the actual build instructions aren't in the readme, so I've asked if they can add more detailed instructions for people. Perhaps also someone can get it put up on <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> to make it even easier (and then get it simple on Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You do need the data files which you can get from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_dark_forces" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Space looter-shooter EVERSPACE 2 set to launch on April 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EVERSPACE 2 from ROCKFISH Games is ready to properly blast off on April 6th and it's looking mighty fine. I've been quite excited about seeing this one completed and I'll be taking a good look around the release or shortly after.</p>
<p>They've also said they're planning to release a free content update in the second half of 2023, and their team is also working on a major expansion for mid-2024. See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u8m47pGxGaM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea606059f206e0a9c60eeffbe5828351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u8m47pGxGaM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those of you waiting on the Native Linux version they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux (and Mac) support are still on track, with the aim to deliver this as close to the full release as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“EVERSPACE 2 has been, by far, our biggest and most ambitious project at ROCKFISH Games and a true labour of love over the five years it’s been in development, the last two of which in Early Access,” says ROCKFISH Games CEO Michael Schade. “With our release date revealed, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel where our amazing community and players all over the world new to the series will get to experience this adventure full of exciting, white-knuckle space combat and beautiful handcrafted deep space and planetside locations to explore. We’ve invested a hefty eight-digits budget into creating the game we’ve always wanted to make, and the team is now hard at work finaling and polishing all of our launch day content to perfection. Beyond the final chapter of the EVERSPACE 2’s story, there’s still a lot to see!”</p>
<p>While it's currently in Early Access, they will be raising the price. So if you've been after it waiting for the full release keep in mind the price will go up to $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99 on February 20th.</p>
<p>EVERSPACE 2 is currently available on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/everspace_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
