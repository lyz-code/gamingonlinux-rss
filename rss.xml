      <title>SteamOS-like Bazzite Linux has some nice growth thanks to great handheld PC support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's no need to wait on Valve releasing SteamOS 3 for everyone thanks to Bazzite. Some really impressive work continues to go into it, and it appears they're enjoying some nice overall growth.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on the Bazzite Discourse forum, developer Jorge O. Castro made a post titled "<a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/just-how-many-of-us-are-there/6852/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Just how many of us are there?</a>" that went over some fun details, with comparisons to a few other Linux builds like Fedora Silverblue and Fedora Kinoite. One thing is clear from it — Bazzite is steadily increasing in popularity with over 25,000 systems active using it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7924869381739553313gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Heck, Bazzite even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/marvel-rivals-gets-a-low-quality-ui-fix-for-bazzite-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got a shout out in a recent Marvel Rival's patch note</a>. More and more are taking notice of Linux for gaming, thanks to how actually easy it is to get going now. And a lot of it, of course, thanks to Valve with the Steam Deck making it truly accessible to millions of gamers. Bazzite has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/even-with-steamos-coming-to-more-systems-bazzite-has-no-plans-to-go-anywhere/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">no plans to go anywhere</a> even when SteamOS 3 is released for everyone.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KONAMI announced that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is going to be launching on August 28th, with pre-orders now live. Another that was announced during the PlayStation State of Play recently and the mini-game from the original is returning too.</p>
<p>With pre-orders live it's another that's doing Advanced Access for the more expensive edition of the game. This allows you to play 48 hours earlier than the standard edition.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KflwVzVIk_o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d2da3a3a943788422c6f0e009cf9877.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KflwVzVIk_o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In addition to giving Advanced Access the Digital Deluxe Edition also gives you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>●Sneaking DLC Pack<br/>
・Uniform: Battle Dress (PW ver.)<br/>
・Uniform: Sneaking Suit (PW ver.)<br/>
・Uniform: Crocodile Suit<br/>
・Uniform: Naked Woodland<br/>
・Uniform: Naked Ammunition Belt<br/>
・Uniform: Gold<br/>
・Face: Glasses<br/>
・Face: Sunglasses<br/>
・Equipment: Kerotan Mask<br/>
・Equipment: GA-KO Mask<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Content<br/>
・Uniform: White Tuxedo<br/>
*This content is also obtainable through in-game progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam release they also confirmed the Snake vs. Monkey minigame from the original is back, where you have to capture a group of mischievous monkeys. </p>
<p>In the PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-2025-on-ps5/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> they also confirmed the game will feature both a "New Style" third-person view, and a "Legacy Style" top-down view "to recreate the look and feel of the original game".</p>
<p>This is another that I expect may be a bit too much for the Steam Deck, with it powered by Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully overall though at least on Desktop Linux it should be okay with Valve's Proton. I'm thoroughly looking forward to it, actually skipping over it from the Master Collection Version to wait for this.</p>

      <title>Open source non-profit platform Codeberg &#34;suffering from hate campaigns due to far-right forces&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Codeberg</a> are a "non-profit, community-led effort that provides Git hosting and other services for free and open source projects" and they've recently had a major problem from what they say are far-right forces engaging in a hate campaign.</p>
<p>Entering my email early on Wednesday morning was something that made me raise my eyebrows. I get a lot of emails, often from various projects I'm tracking across various instances of Git. This one definitely wasn't normal though, coming from a repository on Codeberg named "truth" from a user "truth". The issue subject line from the email I won't repeat, but it was clear racial hatred. Inside the email the issue had a whole bunch of people tagged, myself included.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, an official email from Codeberg came in to apologise and linked to their <a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/we-stay-strong-against-hate-and-hatred.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Codeberg say they're "currently suffering from hate campaigns due to far-right forces, and so are our users", with the target being "several projects advocating tolerance and equal rights" that have been subjected to "hate attacks, such as massive spam of abusive messages in their issue trackers". The attackers took advantage of Codeberg's notification system, that enabled people to create a repository, make an issue and then tag anyone in it notifying them generating an email.</p>
<p>According to Codeberg they have "blocked access to the used functionality and deleted the user accounts" but "they managed to generate a large amount of notification emails already".</p>
<p>Thankfully this hasn't deterred Codeberg from their mostly volunteer-led mission. And they end the announcement with a note about how they will "not be discouraged in our fight against far-right ideologies". They've also been working on securing funding from <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NLnet</a> for more moderation tooling.</p>
<p>I'll take this moment to remind people that I, and GamingOnLinux, take a very firm stance against any kind of hatred. It won't stand in the comments, and I won't put up with it in any attached community like our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>. It's a real shame the lengths some people will go to when spreading hate.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider II open source re-implementation adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TRX, the Tomb Raider I &amp; II: Community Edition open source re-implementation project, has continued advancing and a fresh release of both are out now. With the Tomb Raider II side adding Linux support.</p>
<p>While the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection does exist, this project works with the originals and enhances them. You do need to own the games to run through TRX. You can grab them from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The latest release of <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases/tag/tr2-0.9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TR2X 0.9</a> is out now, which amongst other things includes "Linux builds and toolchain" support, so you can run it natively on Linux and benefit from all the improvements. Going by the <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/tree/develop/docs/tr2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">status page</a> they say "TR2X is finished with the decompilation and is now able to run without the original game .exe. The focus is now to clean up the code base and enrich the game with new enhancements and features". The update also includes a pause dialog, a photo mode feature, support for animated sprites and more.</p>

      <title>A workaround for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs has been found</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Rebirth can work on Linux with AMD GPUs (like Steam Deck), the situation with NVIDIA GPUs has been messy. Open source to the rescue though, again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2657340142" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Commenting</a> on the official Valve Proton GitHub, VKD3D-Proton developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen revealed another project — <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/pyroveil" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pyroveil</a>. From the GitHub it says it's "a Vulkan layer that can automatically replace shaders or roundtrip them via SPIRV-Cross -&gt; glslang. This can create SPIR-V that is more compatible with NVIDIA drivers in particular".</p>
<p>Multiple user reports show it enables the game to render correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14268485861739527229gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>It may not be perfect, with some users still reporting other issues, but at least now NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux can get this game to actually work until NVIDIA solve the driver issues directly. And with this new open source Pyroveil project, perhaps we might see less NVIDIA issues in future for gaming on Linux.</p>

      <title>Fedora threatened with legal action from OBS Studio due to their Flatpak packaging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing you can always count on in the Linux world it's that packaging can be a nightmare. The OBS Studio team are not happy with the Fedora folks due to Flatpak problems and threatened legal action.</p>
<p>Like with traditional distribution packages (RPM, DEB, etc), distros can also run their own Flatpak repositories, instead of using Flathub. This is what Fedora does by default, they have their own Fedora Flatpaks, where they often repackage various software. To note: the OBS Studio on Flathub, is an official OBS package.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Joel Bethke of the OBS Studio team put up an <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> on the Fedora Flatpaks GitLab titled "Broken OBS Studio Flatpak presented as official package" that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/flatpaks/obs-studio" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">unofficial OBS Studio Flatpak</a> on Fedora Flatpaks is, seemingly, poorly packaged and broken, leading to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package. There are several examples of this being the case outside of OBS Studio as well, and many users who are unhappy with Fedora Flatpaks being pushed with no or unclear options to opt-out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/2754" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/2754</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to request that this package is either removed, or made clear that it is a third party package. It should not be upstream's responsibility to ensure downstream packages are working, especially when they overwrite official packages.</p>
<p>I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds. We spend an enormous amount of effort on our official Flatpak published to Flathub to ensure everything is working as well as it can be.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This led to a <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> being filed on Fedora Workstation titled "Deprioritize or remove Fedora Flatpaks, and prioritize Flathub in GNOME Software". The issue noted receiving complaints from upstream developers, like the OBS Studio team. With lots of discussion going on about changing the order of how Fedora presents packages between Fedora Flatpaks, Flathub and RPMs. Inside the comments, there's a fair bit of disagreement between Fedora / Red Hat and the OBS Studio team.</p>
<p>Then on the 12th of February, Bethke escalated things with a <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39#note_2344970813" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> on the original ticket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it's clear that Fedora does not have any interest in a rational discussion at this point, and has decided to resort to name-calling, we are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork.</p>
<p>This is a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution.</p>
<p>Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken. We expect a response within the next 7 business days (By Friday, February 21st, 2025).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then the Fedora team have <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/flatpaks/obs-studio/c/aa78e92a7e68e795b9554bc8dd3b48204be58357?branch=stable" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> their Flatpak of OBS Studio to an "end of life" status, and eventually it looks like it will be removed, so things seem to be moving into a direction that should appease the OBS Studio team.</p>
<p>A messy situation but hopefully one some lessons can be learned from.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN launches in May - will have Kernel Level Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN is now set for launch on May 30th, and it does look great, but the anti-cheat could be a problem for Steam Deck / Linux players.</p>
<p>While the first ELDEN RING <em>also</em> has anti-cheat, specifically Easy Anti-Cheat (and does work), you can <em>never</em> be certain if a new game using it will actually work on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton unless the developer is clear on it. NIGHTREIGN clearly mentions on the Steam page it uses "Kernel Level Anti-Cheat" this time around too, which ELDEN RING does not (but that's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty new rule from Valve</a>). Compared with the first game, NIGHTREIGN is also firmly focused on the online play which <em>could</em> make a big difference here.</p>
<p>New trailer below:</p>

<p>We're tracking various games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat status on a dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>I've reached out via email to find out if the anti-cheat will be supported again like the first ELDEN RING.</p>

      <title>Wayland Colour Management and HDR Protocol finally merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After years of work across many areas, lots of discussions and more work - the Wayland Colour Management and HDR Protocol has been merged! This means it will finally be released with a future version of Wayland Protocols.</p>
<p>Some desktop environments and compositors already have support for it, at varying levels, and in some cases pulled in parts of it early just to get the ball rolling on it. Now it's really <em>properly</em> ready.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going back to the original merge request from <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14/diffs?commit_id=452e943b4991ffd0584b69cfb1b2c72852857b47" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">five years ago</a> the main goals were:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reliably maintain the display server color setup.</li>
<li>Support professional color managed applications (presentation).</li>
<li>Support displaying TV broadcasts and other high quality video content.</li>
<li>Support a wide variety of monitors and application content, including wide gamut and/or HDR.</li>
<li>Bring basic color management to applications that are not color-aware at all.</li>
<li>Bring adequate color management to Wayland applications that are color-aware but not color managed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be really great to see proper HDR support on Linux now for apps and games, one less barrier for people switching from other platforms and for just advancing Linux on the desktop as a whole.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress has some exciting plans for the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Adventure Mode out now, the Dwarf Fortress team are looking ahead and it's sounding quite exciting with some big features coming to the game.</p>
<p>Over the next few updates there's going to be an Lua upgrade which they said "will allow you to create more powerful mods and lay the foundation for future Myth and Magic updates". For the Fortress mode, they're going to be focusing on sieges as they want "to give players the tools and abilities to be more properly prepared for an attack". Plus plans to have abilities to "interact with magic systems (beyond necromancers and mods.)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1853985991739453234gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some other of their plans for the next few updates include (no guarantees though):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allow siegers to plan and learn, tracking where deaths occur and using alternate routes.</li>
<li>Properly equipped siegers should be able to build, demolish and dig (default on, can be turned off in difficulty settings).</li>
<li>Kidnapped humans and dwarves should be more interesting - warlords and demon-trained sorcerers focused on siege warfare and infiltration (for now).</li>
<li>Temple/etc.-based defenses for any magic that proves too annoying to combat with soldiers.</li>
<li>Ranged weapon/squad fixes.</li>
<li>Changes to defensive siege weapons to make them more useful.</li>
<li>If ranged weapon changes remove the delightful effect of fast-shooting crossbows, add a repeating defensive bolt thrower emplacement that uses regular bolts.</li>
<li>Changes to cage traps to make it more intensive but still possible to e.g. capture megabeasts.</li>
<li>Make megabeast and kobold attacks more functional and interesting.</li>
<li>Fix and improve underground civilization attacks (as far as we can without future map changes).</li>
<li>Anything from Combat Flow and Combat Styles that comes up, also a notion of reach.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After that back to Adventure Mode and they are hoping to add "Site Building", a way for you to have your own little settlements. It was in the classic version but not in the new graphical Steam build. Then after that the focus is on Maps that will include world map rewrites and graphics improvements, which they say is needed to prepare "for a more magical and procedural, dynamically-reactive future".</p>
<p>Sometime eventually they'll then get back to various other bigger new features like "Villains, army warfare, civilizations, etc". They also said all steps through the roadmap will include various art additions and "content that make sense to add along the way".</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade confirmed for a PC release in June - Steam page now live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hot on the heels of the recent news that Shift Up mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/stellar-blade-to-be-optimized-for-the-steam-deck-and-other-umpc-environments/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Blade would be optimized for Steam Deck</a> and other smaller devices, we have a Steam page and release month.</p>
<p>During the PlayStation State of Play February 2025 edition, it was announced that "Both the PC version of Stellar Blade and the Goddess of Victory: Nikke DLC (available on PS5 and PC) launch in June". To go along with that the Steam page has been set live so you can wishlist and follow it now too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/90025721739452233gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore an awe-inspiring post-apocalyptic world</strong></p>
<p>The future of humanity is balanced on the edge of a blade. Ravaged by strange, powerful creatures, Earth has been abandoned, and what is left of the decimated human race has fled to a Colony in outer space.</p>
<p>After travelling from the Colony, EVE arrives on the desolate remains of our planet with a clear-cut mission: to save humankind by reclaiming Earth from the Naytiba – the malevolent force that has devastated it.</p>
<p>But as EVE tackles the Naytiba one-by-one, piecing together the mysteries of the past in the ruins of human civilization, she realizes that her mission is far from straightforward. In fact, almost nothing is as it seems…</p>
<p><strong>A thrilling slice of razor-sharp action</strong></p>
<p>Engage in blisteringly fast combat as you slash a path through the remnants of Earth. Unleash graceful yet brutal attacking combos, unlock new moves and weapon upgrades, and face epic boss encounters that will challenge both brain and brawn in equal measure.</p>
<p><strong>An incredible visual experience</strong></p>
<p>Become immersed in a highly detailed post-apocalyptic world that blends beauty and horror to spectacular effect.</p>
<p><strong>A deep, unforgettable adventure</strong></p>
<p>Unravel a gripping human fate story, with mature themes, a thought-provoking narrative and emotionally-charged revelations from beginning to end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be quite the treat for gamers on PC / Steam Deck. I can't wait to see how it runs with Proton to see what all the fuss is about on this.</p>

      <title>The glibc 2.41 update has been causing problems for Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems a recent update to glibc with version 2.41 release at the end of January, has been causing all sorts of problems for Linux gamers that have pulled in the update (mostly on rolling-release distributions).</p>
<p>Valve have already updated multiple titles to get around the issue including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/portal-2-gets-a-compatibility-update-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Portal 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/left-4-dead-2-gets-a-compatibility-update-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead 2</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/542223345638178895" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> and other updates on the way for some older games. This isn't just affecting Valve though, as more and more games are appearing to have problems. Some other quick examples with the bug include <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/504230/discussions/4/601895505111349304/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Celeste</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1627350/discussions/1/600770015625540643/?tscn=1739448468" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DEAD LETTER DEPT.</a>, there's no doubt many more that it will affect but I'm not going to give a really long list here.</p>

<p>There's an open <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> for glibc, with a recent reply from a developer noting that due to the backwards compatibility issue, the bug was reopened "to consider possible options for the release and the applications involved". This is not the first time glibc has caused problems with Linux compatibility for gaming, like a previous DT_HASH change that resulted in Easy Anti-Cheat breaking.</p>
<p>Not the end of the world though this time, developers and Linux users can still solve the issue themselves if needed running <code class="inline-code">execstack -c</code> on the affected libraries. Don't just take my advice on it though if you're a developer or gamer reading this, always look up what you're doing fully. Run at your own risk.</p>
<p>For game devs using FMOD, they were already aware of the issue, and <a href="http://qa.fmod.com/t/glibc-2-41-breaks-loading-fmodstudio-libraries-in-standalone-linux-builds/22592/2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">solved</a> it with FMOD 2.02.00. The FMOD team said for older versions, using the execstack command is safe.</p>
<p>Hopefully the glibc developers will be able to do something about this breaking change for various games.</p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 confirmed for release in September with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K have now revealed that Borderlands 4 is set for release on September 23rd, along with giving it a short new trailer. However, they've said a more thorough gameplay reveal will come in the PlayStation State of Play later this Spring.</p>
<p>We still only know a very limited amount of info about the game, apart from it will continue the tradition of being a co-op shooter. Previous games in the series worked well enough on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton, so likely this one will again too unless they do something odd.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zlEZzjpEbko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/232d8c10809b03f6349fe5ec6356c754.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zlEZzjpEbko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The press release wasn't even particularly helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most ambitious Borderlands title to-date delivers more looter-shooter Mayhem than ever before, as the new trailer packs in intense action, outrageous enemies, and the killer loot awaiting players on the dangerous new planet Kairos.</p>
<p><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> transforms players into an unstoppable force on the battlefield, blasting through enemies with an arsenal of incredible weaponry. The iconic Borderlands gameplay fans know and love is evolving with even more movement abilities, as players can flex their skill expression with glide, dodge, double jump, fixed-point grapple, and more, to deftly deal death from every direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you looking forward to it? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Marvel Rivals gets a low-quality UI fix for Bazzite Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see dedicated support like this from a massive game. Marvel Rivals had a small update that came with a fix for Bazzite Linux.</p>
<p>You don't see this happening from many developers of online multiplayer games. The patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/523083139556311044" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "High-end computers running the Bazzite (Linux) system were mistakenly tapping into low-quality UI resources. Fear not—this issue has been rm'd!".</p>
<p>This is in addition to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/marvel-rivals-team-issue-a-statement-on-recent-bans-for-steam-deck-and-macos-players/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their previous announcement</a> about compatibility layer support (Proton / Wine) for Linux, Steam Deck and macOS reversing some unfortunate accidental bans. Clearly, NetEase Games are showing how it can be done here. Quite a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/blocking-linux-steam-deck-in-apex-legends-led-to-a-meaningful-reduction-in-cheaters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big difference to the likes of Apex Legends</a>.</p>

<p>Mudborne is a casual nature management sim about discovering &amp; breeding frogs!<br/>
<br/>
You awaken from your hibernation to find your pond abandoned and empty. Through a combination of crafting minigames, menu management and puzzle solving, experiment with genetics to breed new frogs and recover what was lost.<br/>
<br/>
Using the genetic keys of the new species you create you can unlock the paths between the waking and dreaming worlds, explore the land of those still hibernating, and embark on a journey to help restore the lost populations and find out what happened.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires confirmed for a March release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The most popular game from Paradox Development Studio, Hearts of Iron IV, is set for a new country pack expansion on March 4th. Released originally in 2016, it's the most played game from PDS with a 46,735 concurrent player peak from the last 24 hours. Much bigger than their other games. </p>
<p>With the newest DLC, Country Pack - Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires, Paradox said: "Imperial ambitions collide in the challenging lands of Central and South Asia. The British Empire is secure in the Raj and Iraq, but has long held designs on influencing oil rich Iran and unconquerable Afghanistan - also targets of an aggressive Soviet foreign policy from the north. Rewrite the history of a region caught between bowing to a larger alliance and homegrown dreams of national strength. Can you defy the odds and possibly resurrect the glories of a far distant past?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FW103FLlgM0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f42164077029990cbfa679a05b10e745.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FW103FLlgM0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires includes new content for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iran: Iran is a potential great power, hemmed in by the pressure of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. A significant new Focus Tree allows the player to resist the imperial incursions that historically weakened Iran, as well as offering potential for a revived and modern Persian Empire in the heart of Asia.</li>
<li>India: The Raj is the jewel of the British Empire, rich and strategically vital. However, a growing independence movement threatens to disrupt the war effort and dissolve the empire. A large focus tree focused on the struggle of Indian Independence offers many alternate historical paths, including the revival of the East India Company as a corporate nation, as well as the possible freedom of the Princely States, restoration of the Mughal Empire and more.</li>
<li>Iraq: Take control of this British client state and try to chart your own path, embracing the calls for pan-arab nationalism and siding with the axis against the allies. Manage the many competing ethnic and religious factions in Iraq and develop the strategically important oil fields.</li>
<li>Afghanistan: The historic Graveyard of Empires, isolated from the wider war, offers many alternate paths. Continue the historical path of neutrality and isolation, or choose the road of rapid industrialization and building a new power in the mountains of Central Asia.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for retro styled isometric solve &#39;em up Blackford PI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BitGlint Games have released a demo for Blackford PI, a retro styled isometric detective adventure that looks really charming. Announced by the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericretro.bsky.social/post/3lhret6uovs2a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the demo has a Linux version.</p>
<p>According to the developer they were inspired by retro classic 8-bit games like MOVIE, Contact Sam Cruise &amp; the Magic Knight series. They said the puzzles you'll find are built on a traditional verb/noun structure but implemented via a menu system.</p>
<p>More: "Set in 1940s New York in the offices of a secretive engineering &amp; design company, You play Clarence Blackford, a man tasked with unravelling the mysterious goings on at Midtown Design Bureau".</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/blackford-pi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">check out the demo on itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>The developer also previously released <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Melkhior's Mansion</a>, a colourful retro throwback to classic games from the 80s with a ZX Spectrum inspired colour palette. I'm sure a few older readers will love that one. That also has a Linux version available.</p>

      <title>Tryhard is a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grapefruit Games recently revealed Tryhard, a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand.</p>
<p>"You were just a tourist visiting New Zealand - but now you're managing an underdog rugby club somehow. Everyone expects you to fail. You've never even played rugby before! But you'll prove them wrong, challenge the champs, and win the Ramphorlie Shield."</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement on Steam they give a little more detail on their thought process for this one, titled "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3443270/view/500565049177276422" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A Sportslike Manifesto</a>". Basically, they want to refresh the entire sports genre with it as other traditional sports games "ignore too many aspects of sports, and thus, have stagnated and offer little to gamers today". Definitely has my curiosity piqued here.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oO6uRbBykeg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d481a1e20d913e824c567dcdf6775c06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oO6uRbBykeg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<ul>
<li>Fresh blend of tactical RPG, auto battler, and sports genres.</li>
<li>Build the perfect squad from 15+ recruitable characters and dozens of skills inspired by real-life rugby.</li>
<li>Rugby knowledge is OPTIONAL. <em>It’s OK, many rugby players don’t know anything about rugby either.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>MANAGE A SPORTS CLUB</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Search for club sponsors and fundraise for new equipment.</li>
<li>You’ll need to recruit a secretary, treasurer, and patron too.</li>
<li>File paperwork and argue with the bank! <em>The possibilities are endless.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>LIVE IN VIRTUAL NEW ZEALAND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you lose, the story mode continues, just like real-life.</li>
<li>Explore an authentic 3D recreation of the biggest city in New Zealand!</li>

      <title>Crytek lay off 15% of staff with Crysis 4 on hold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More news on some job losses today following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/unity-continues-laying-off-staff-as-troubles-continue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unity game engine layoffs</a>, we have Crytek also shedding staff and shelving Crysis 4. On X / Twitter, the official Crytek account <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> an image announcement. Crytek said it will affect about 15% of their staff, so about 60 people.</p>
<p>I've copied the text and image below to save you clicking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years. It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>
<p>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.</p>
<p>We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With Hunt: Showdown 1896, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation. We will continue to expand and evolve Hunt: Showdown 1896 with great content and drive our strategy for our engine CRYENGINE.</p>

      <title>Unity continues laying off staff as troubles continue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After all the mess that was the Unity fees situation, the troubles continue, with another round of layoffs at the game engine developer.</p>
<p>Multiple reports by now former employees have spread, including a <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> from Behavior Package Tech Lead, Shanee Nishry, that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Behavior Community,</p>
<p>Thank you for your love and support for our project. Unfortunately we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer.</p>
<p>I’ve reached out to leadership to ask if they can open source the project, but there is no guarantee.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank you so much again for your kindness and support and your amazing engagement and feedback. I wish we could take Behavior to the finish line we wanted to get it to.</p>
<p>Farewell </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One entire team gone, along with reports across Unity of others being told their time is up. Like André de Miranda Cardoso, Unity Lead Game Designer, who noted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andre-mc_unfortunately-i-was-affected-by-the-latest-activity-7295024528282288128-4mqz/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> that they've been included in the layoff. Another Florence (Rolland) Rolland-Soulier, who was a Senior Software Enginner, noted they were also let go in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294815856256049152/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> mentioning "another wave of mass layoffs hit Unity".</p>
<p>In an article on <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>, where they've seen the email that was sent to staff from Matthew Bromberg, Unity President and CEO, which clearly noted how Unity are focusing on adverts a lot with tighter advert tech integrations following the merger with ironSource <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unity-to-merge-with-ironsource-with-a-buzzword-salad-press-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Unity for comment.</em></p>
<p>A good time to remind you of the free, open source and cross-platform <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> that has made huge advancements in the last few years with more game developers picking it up.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.21 released fixing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle eyes and security bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since December 2024, Valve have now released SteamOS 3.6.21 as stable for Steam Deck bringing in some bug and security fixes.</p>
<p>Here's all that's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/520831247493103691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rendering issue with characters' eyes in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Added support for the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller.</li>
<li>Fixed Linux kernel CVE-2024-50089.</li>
<li>Fixed mpg123 CVE-2024-10573.</li>
<li>Fixed libarchive CVE-2024-20696.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2681699051739359856gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></p>
<p>Don't go expecting Steam Input to support the extra buttons on the top of the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless though, as they're done via 8BitDo software. Much like with the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.4G Controller, the back buttons cannot be changed either.</p>

      <title>Keep Driving is a refreshing road trip management RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A road trip RPG that blends in some inventory management and unique turn-based battles that has you fight off everything on the road from tractors to abandoned suitcases, Keep Driving is a charming and clever game worth your time. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> working perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1101130751739305509gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1101130751739305509gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here you're trying to get across the country to join up with friends at a festival. It's a long way though, filled with dangerous roads and all sorts of strange people wanting to be picked up along the way. You'll be ensuring your car stays in top shape, along with sorting through your inventory often and attempting to keep up your own energy levels. It's a really unique blend of game features.</p>
<p>The developer said The Oregon Trail is one of the main inspirations for the game, and going into it knowing that should give you a reasonable idea of what type of gameplay to expect. It's like a modernised version of it with an early 2000's vibe. It's just captivating from the moment you set off and start to burn some rubber.</p>
<p>One of the really interesting ideas here is the battle system. It's not like you're getting out of your car and hitting people, instead it's about the encounters directly with everything being a possible danger, but also at times quite lucrative for loot. This could be overtaking another vehicle, getting lost, dealing with puddles of water, your car making weird noises, potholes and lots more random events.</p>
<p>The battles are turn-based and each turn has the possibility to reduce your car durability, your personal energy, your money and your gas. The attacks come as various icons that appear on the bar at the bottom of the screen, and you have various abilities to reduce how much damage each will take every turn. These abilities of yours need you to drag them over the bar to match up their icons as much as possible to remove the harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11928045591739303689gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11928045591739303689gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's a road trip game, there will be hitchhikers to pick up (or not). As you pick up more passengers they will all add to your abilities during these battle encounters. They will also add to the overall atmosphere of the game, sprinkling in some chatter along the way. Like my first passenger, who has a condition where they just fall asleep all the time, who kept asking me not to dump them in the rain as they didn't want to fall asleep in a puddle. Passengers gain experience and level up to become more important as the trip goes on too.</p>
<p>You also get to constantly upgrade your vehicle (and unlock more) as well. There's quite a lot of upgrades and customisation you can do here. Simple things like changing the colour but also proper upgrades like tyre types for different bonuses, engine upgrades, roof upgrades and more.</p>
<p>There is of course a lot that can go wrong during the game. Constantly trying to balance your different attributes is actually quite a bit more challenging than expected. You really do need to ensure you're always nicely stocked up, skipping even a single shop on your trip can end up quite fatal. Don't worry though, you can always call your parents to bail you out, but if they don't — game over.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8379871931739304461gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8379871931739304461gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You also have character status effects to deal with too, that you will want to get rid of as soon as possible as they will debuff you during your run. Things like being cold, that you could get rid of by drinking some hot coffee, will add to your durability damage during events. Or if you're starving, which will increase your energy costs.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A procedurally generated pixel art world to explore one road at a time.</li>
<li>A nostalgic early 2000s setting with an emphasis on the analogue.</li>
<li>Use turn-based ‘combat’ to solve situations (like getting stuck behind a tractor).</li>
<li>Pick up misfits, oddballs and lost souls as you go.</li>
<li>Featuring a killer soundtrack by local indie bands.</li>
<li>Multiple endings to unlock when you return to the road.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While it works great on Desktop Linux, it's not yet a perfect experience on Steam Deck due to some text being too small and no controller support (which they said they're working on). Feels like it <em>should</em> be a perfect fit for handhelds when they sort those two issues out.</p>
<p>Love it. Wonderful idea with some great music and the pixel art is terrific too. Absolutely worth grabbing.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming overlay MangoHud version 0.8 is out now with Intel GPU support, improved Wayland keybinds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short testing period, the Linux performance overlay MangoHud had version 0.8.0 released today to bring new features and fixes to one of my favourite open source projects. This also powers the built-in overlay on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>There's no major changes from the Beta that I previously reported on, so I'll just refresh your memory here.</em></p>
<p>This release adds a few more applications to the blacklist to stop it appearing and causing issues with them including the Ubisoft Store (UplayWebCore.exe), halloy (IRC client) and Plutonium Launcher (plutonium.exe, plutonium-launcher-win32.exe).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21461146021739293656gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21461146021739293656gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Customized MangoHud, click image to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>If you like my simple horizontal layout you can find it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Just pop it into "~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf".</p>
<p>By default, it will look more like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/127365671739293438gol1.jpg"/></p>

	<ul>
<li>The shim is preloaded first instead of the opengl library</li>
<li>it checks to make sure there is an opengl context to hook before loading mangohud</li>
<li>this should resolve some crashes. More detailed information here <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/c22ced01083fd32476b0bdd8b969ee749631469a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">c22ced0</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using exec and inside steam runtime, launch command using <code class="inline-code">steam-runtime-launch-client</code>
<ul>
<li>If mangohud is used inside flatpak, you need to allow your app to speak on <code class="inline-code">org.freedesktop.Flatpak</code> dbus address.</li>
<li>Example if you're using mangohud in steam: <code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Intel GPUs support (integrated and discrete, i915 and xe drivers)
	<ul>
<li>Temperature is only available in linux 6.13+</li>
<li>Temperature and Power Usage is not available for integrated gpus</li>
<li>VRAM and GPU Usage is per-process not per-system (that would require root rights)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple GPUs support:
	<ul>
<li>By default, MangoHud displays all GPUs. To select needed GPUs, you can use <code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> or <code class="inline-code">pci_dev</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Params</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">network_color</code> sets the color of the network hud element</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">display_server</code> shows if the display server is Xorg, Xwayland or wayland</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> set the GPUs to display in the hud e.g gpu_list=0,1</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">proc_mem</code> and <code class="inline-code">io_read</code> now works properly in gamescope (mangoapp)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Excellent narrative adventure Scarlet Hollow is getting a greatly expanded &#34;soft relaunch&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best narrative adventure visual novels on PC, Scarlet Hollow is getting a big juicy update in March that's basically a "soft relaunch" of the game. From Black Tabby Games, they also made the very popular Slay the Princess.</p>
<p>The update called Scarlet Hollow - The Roads Untraveled, will launch on March 3rd. It comes with a whole lot including over "70,000 words of new story content" across Episodes 1 and 2 which allow you to explore previously unseen paths.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14250912701739290682gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>We're also getting an overhaul to the user interface and visuals, a small update to Episode 3 and 4 and they're hoping to also have a cut ending for Episode 4 make it in time too.</p>
<p>They said that "Not only will the first two chapters feel more dynamic once this update is out, but the new and expanded content will better position us to make Episode 5 hit just the way we'd like it to". Going by the Steam page, a total of 7 episodes are planned to be released eventually.</p>
<p>Scarlet Hollow has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A bit more about it if you missed it before:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A heavily branching narrative where your decisions (actually) matter</strong>. The relationships you forge and the decisions you make will dramatically alter your journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A complex paranormal mystery</strong>. Investigate haunted houses, strange sightings in the woods, a deteriorating mine, and more as you try and piece together what happened in Scarlet Hollow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trait-based dialogue and role-playing.</strong> Scarlet Hollow's dialogue system is driven by role-playing elements that let you choose who you want to be. Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless? <strong><em>Can you talk to animals</em></strong>? 21 different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds.</p>
</li>

<p>From the press release: “Before diving into Scarlet Hollow’s final chapters, we wanted to take the opportunity to make its opening act more reflective of the extreme agency and deep character writing that defines the later episodes,” says Tony Howard-Arias, co-founder at Black Tabby Games. “Episode 1 was the very first game we made, and while we’re so proud of the impact it’s had on people, we’ve also learned so much since its release. We’re better game designers, better writers, and we know our characters much more intimately now than when we started. We’re so excited to give old fans an opportunity to re-explore the beginning of their journeys, and we can’t wait for a whole new crop of players to enter the Holler for the first time.” </p>

      <title>Fight off pesky humans and raise spider babies in Isle Goblin, a blend of Stardew Valley and Terraria</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kilowatt Games are currently working on Isle Goblin, a curious blend of features from the likes of Stardew Valley and Terraria that I'm pretty excited to see more from.</p>
<p>With a big mixture of features including dungeon crawling, big-boss combat, town building, farming and much more that you can play alone or with up to 8 people it has a lot of fun sounding ideas. The developer has been doing video logs on YouTube about it for 3 years now, and the progress on it is looking really impressive.</p>
<p>More about it: "Human scum have invaded your island, and it's up to you to defend your territory! Embark on a journey filled with action, exploration, and the joy of nurturing a thriving goblin community. Grow crops, raise livestock, and build a bustling farm to sustain your goblin tribe. Delve deep into the long-untouched depths, mining precious resources and discovering hidden treasures that will aid you in your fight against the encroaching humans."</p>
<p>Check out their preview video from 2024:</p>

<p>Being made in Unity, the developer was looking at switching game engines like a lot of developers when the big Unity fee situation happened back in 2023. They've continued on Unity for now though, but in one video mentioned they do plan to use something else for future projects.</p>
<p>In a much more recent video, they estimate the game might have a demo out around May:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engaging top-down RPG gameplay centered around exploration and construction.</li>
<li>Cultivate crops, tend to livestock, and manage your farm to ensure your goblin tribe's prosperity.</li>
<li>Uncover rich mineral deposits and dig deep into underground caves for valuable resources.</li>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3 is out now with big fractional scaling improvements, drawing tablet upgrades and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma 6.3 has been released and it's another beautiful sounding release! Filled with new features and fixes for my favourite Linux desktop environment. <em>Plasma is also used on the Steam Deck for the Desktop Mode.</em></p>
<p>For those of you scaling up your desktop there's some good news with this release. The developers overhauled how fractional scaling works, making a "stronger effort to snap things to the screen’s pixel grid, greatly reducing blurriness and visual gaps everywhere and producing sharper and crisper images". Sounds awesome and they said it works at high zoom levels too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1442913371739287563gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1442913371739287563gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Plasma 6.3</em></p>
<p>For people who own a drawing tablet there's plenty of improvements there too. There's an overhauled system settings page for tablets, along with a bunch of new configuration options to really set it up how you want it. Laptop users should rejoice too, since you can now configure the built-in touchpad to be turned off to not interfere with typing.</p>
<p>Panels, like the bar at the bottom in the above screenshot, can also now be cloned. Plus the Kickoff launcher to go through applications had a tweak to only change category (Games, Graphics, Office etc) when you click on them, instead of flicking through constantly whenever you hover the mouse.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Lots of other changes like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto random password being created when setting up a network hotspot.</li>
<li>Discover store will show sandbox apps that have permissions changing with updates.</li>
<li>Discover will also show if a package is directly from a developer, verified or from a trusted third party.</li>
<li>System Monitor got improvements to be more accurate and use less CPU resources.</li>
<li>More accurate colours when using the Night Light feature.</li>
<li>+ lots of smaller additions and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.3.0/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The release schedule has also been <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2025/02/10/about-the-plasma-release-schedule/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>. In future, Beta releases will be spread across 6 weeks instead of 4, with a new Beta every 2 weeks.</p>

      <title>Monster taming roguelite Aethermancer from the devs of Monster Sanctuary gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Sanctuary was good fun, so I'm real keen to see more from moi rai games. Their sticking to monster taming / capturing with Aethermancer and now you can try it out in a demo.</p>
<p>There's some interesting design choices here. Firstly with the capture system, where you capture the soul of a creature so you can rebirth it into your party. A fun difference to capturing specific monsters directly. The second is that when one of your creatures dies in battle, it's gone forever. That's not the end of it though, as this game is all about the cycle of death and rebirth. It's all about the rogue-lite hook here of meta progression, with creatures becoming stronger from previous lives.</p>
<p>Check out the demo trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pDoTiL14oIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ee133adbe573a369cbf28308d6dbb3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pDoTiL14oIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What they said to expect from the demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic Roguelite experience but mixed with monster taming.</li>
<li>You are expected to fail! But collecting new Monsters and gaining experience will eventually make you succeed!</li>
<li>While this is a demo, you can spend a lot of time until you discover everything it contains.</li>
<li>15 playable monsters with hundreds of skills</li>
<li>2 Areas (and Champions to defeat!)</li>
<li>NPCs with a dynamic dialogue system that react to your choices</li>
<li>A lot of meta upgrades: soulbonding monsters (to be able to play with them on new runs) for example</li>
<li>Languages supported: English, German, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese</li>
<li>Controller support</li>
<li>An additional 'Heroic' difficulty challenge if you defeat the game on normal.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For this one they're not going with Team17 as publisher again. Instead, they're working with offbrand games.</p>
<p>As far as I know it will have Linux support at release, but the demo needs to be run via Proton. I've tested it working perfectly with the latest Proton 9.0-4 from Valve. This is definitely one you're going to want to try. Some really slick animations in the battles, with some really fun creature design too. The way you gain new creatures is also quite interesting, and definitely different to other games in the monster taming genre.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this is going to hook me badly at release, the demo was delicious. Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3462260/Aethermancer_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the demo</a> on Steam.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games / 2K have today fully launched Sid Meier's Civilization VII, along with full Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It's really great to see continued Linux support here. Previous versions of the game were external ports by Aspyr Media, that often ended up quite outdated with broken cross-play for Linux but this time around it appears Firaxis did it directly.</p>
<p>Since I personally purchased it to play and cover it here, you'll have to keep in mind I've had basically no time with it so far, as 2K did not reply to my email about a key. At least on a very cursory look the Linux version appears to run quite nicely, coming in with Vulkan as the default rendering API. The game does have Denuvo Anti-tamper on Windows, but as far as I'm aware as usual that does not apply to the Linux version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19090530531739281298gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19090530531739281298gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Civilization VII on Linux, Max Settings</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of complaints about the game as a whole, with it only just hitting above 50% positive user reviews on Steam to a Mixed overall score. Lots of complaints about the UI, to bigger issues with gameplay changes, so it's clear Firaxis have work to do, and it's coming in hot with patches already out during the previous Advanced Access period.</p>
<p>In a way, I get the complaints, it feels less personal than older Civilization games with the changes to progression. When you go through Ages, you pick an entirely new Civilization, which then changes how you'll continue to progress through it. However, it also makes it feel quite fresh compared with previous iterations. I'm already not a fan of some of the forced diplomacy choices though, as you have to respond in some situations and depending on how much Influence you have accumulated you may be locked into a specific choice you really don't want to do.</p>
<p>At least in terms of performance, so far I can't see any issue with the Linux version, it's incredibly smooth on my system (Ryzen 5800X, Radeon RX 6800 XT, Kubuntu 24.10). The game is absolutely gorgeous too, it really does look incredible. Performance, naturally, does degrade as the game goes on though. But on max settings it's looking really good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5741169531739281192gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5741169531739281192gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Firaxis did already give a small roadmap of what they're doing about all the feedback as a reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prioritizing UI Improvements:</strong> Our top priority is improving the UI. We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more. We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Implementing Community-Requested Features:</strong> Several key features that we've seen you ask for will be included in upcoming patches as free updates, and we'll continue to work with the community to improve and add to the game. We're still working on exact timing, but can share the following items are being prioritized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<strong>Rolling Out Quality-of-Life Updates in Patch 1.1.0 (Deploying in March):</strong> Work is already well underway on Patch 1.1.0, which includes fixes and adjustments that were already on our radar. This list includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that it's Steam Deck Verified, I was definitely curious to see for myself what the experience was like there too. Testing on an LCD 512GB Steam Deck and it actually surprisingly does feel really good there. Although, it took an age to reserve the space before even downloading it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19780500261739282500gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19780500261739282500gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Civilization VII on Steam Deck, Medium Settings, Zoomed Out</em></p>
<p>The save system is <em>not</em> using the Steam Cloud though. If you want saves across devices, you have to login to the 2K account system (which worked fine), and then specifically save it in the cross play menu. Once you've sorted your 2K account, loading a game on Steam Deck from another device is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the game does include some text scaling and it all looks pretty good, nice and readable. Nice to see Firaxis remember that not everyone has perfect vision and play on a huge monitor. There's even a "viewing experience" setting to change it between handheld, TV and desktop.</p>
<p>As for performance on Steam Deck: on the Medium preset at least in the early game, it's holding 60FPS when moving around the map when zoomed out. But when you zoom right in, the performance is all over the place when scrolling. Changing down to Low didn't help, so you probably want to just lock it to 30FPS to make it smoother overall. Plus, it looks absolutely fine on Low on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4613226341739282985gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4613226341739282985gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Civilization VII on Steam Deck, Low Settings, Zoomed In</em></p>
<p>I also found an odd controller bug here, as I was completely unable to change the graphics preset on Steam Deck while in a game. The drop-down doesn't correctly grab controller input and even touchscreen was no help. It worked from the main menu though. Other than that, they've done some great work to make it accessible on the controls overall.</p>
<p>Nice to see Sid Meier's Civilization VII running very nicely on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck at release.</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade to be optimized for the Steam Deck and other &#34;UMPC environments&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shift Up have today released another earnings report for the end of 2024, and in it they talk about some expectations for the upcoming PC release of the popular Stellar Blade. <em>A PC release was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/stellar-blade-should-come-to-pc-in-2025-dev-expects-sales-to-exceed-console/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed in November last year</a>.</em></p>
<p>On page 6 of their business performance report PDF, there's a Q&amp;A with this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q.2: What are the expected results of PC version, and why?</p>
<p>A.2 : In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version. We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry.</p>
<p>We have identified and analyzed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC, and we are preparing to release the game in a way that ensures continued success in the PC market. This will include optimization, enhancing user convenience, adding supplementary content, and tailored marketing strategies<br/>
unique to Shift Up. In particular, we plan to optimize the game to ensure smooth gameplay even in UMPC (Steam Deck) environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UMPC means usually "Ultra-mobile PC".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9990785961739217556gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stellar Blade</em></p>
<p>Hopefully then, we should see Stellar Blade performing well on the Steam Deck, and across the PC platform as a whole, whenever it releases. We've seen quite a lot of poorly performing game releases over the last year, so I do hope Stellar Blade doesn't disappoint.</p>

      <title>Try the new demo and trailer for Rift Riff, a fast and &#34;strategically tight&#34; tower defense game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love tower defense games, you're going to want to check out the new demo and trailer for the upcoming Rift Riff. A "strategically tight" game, the developer says.</p>
<p>With quite minimalist design, and pretty fast gameplay, this one is really easy to get into. Quite a fast-moving game, one that will end up taking your full attention as you run around the map building various towers. It was previously shown off in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/godot-engines-2024-showreel-shows-a-lot-of-fun-stuff-for-the-open-source-game-engine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine showreel from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Rift Riff puts you in the shoes of a lone rifter navigating the depths of spacetime in search of treasure. Across a shifting cycle of lush and barren worlds, you summon towers, harvest energy, and battle hostile inhabitants – all to expand your arsenal and plunge even deeper into the unknown."</p>
<p>A new trailer is live too below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M79VZIUvhHA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a969c566a45be7d531ebe777053aad4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M79VZIUvhHA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo should give you just over an hour gameplay, showing off the first 8 worlds. The full game has much more:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>14 worlds with 2 or more scenarios each.</li>
<li>15 tower types with 8 overpowered upgrades.</li>
<li>24 monster types with varying behaviors.</li>
<li>28 challenges with increasing difficulty.</li>
<li>All the good Steam stuff: achievements, stats, controller support, cloud saves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tried out the demo, which has a Native Linux version, and came away really impressed with it. Some lovely visual design and fantastic audio to go along with it. Definitely keen to see a whole lot more from this one. The action is great when you get further in and have a few extra tower types too.</p>

      <title>Popular game launcher Playnite will get Linux support but it&#39;s still a while away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playnite is a very popular free and open source video game library manager, one used a lot on Windows and a developer has confirmed they will be working on Linux support.</p>
<p>The launcher supports linking games from Steam, Epic, EA, GOG, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect and other services. This includes emulation, a fullscreen mode, theme support, an extensions system and much more. It's an incredibly feature-filled app.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9684077911739185952gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Right now, there's no Linux support, but that will eventually change. They're currently waiting on <a href="https://avaloniaui.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Avalonia UI</a>, an open source framework for building user interfaces with .NET, to get some improvements though. As noted by a developer on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/59#issuecomment-2634737400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2025 update</p>
<p>Upcoming major release (P11) will be on modern open source and multi-platform .NET runtime but will still use Window only WPF based UI. This is for several reasons, one of the main ones being that Avalonia's developer experience is not, in my opinion, good enough to be used in project like Playnite. Playnite heavily depends on community made extensions and themes, often developed by hobbyist developers, not professionals, and Avalonia is simply not user friendly as much as I would like it to be for us.</p>
<p>We are 100% moving to Avalonia at some point in future, it's just not going to be with Playnite 11 release.</p>
<p>So current plan is to release Playnite 11, continue developing it for Windows only and once Avalonia's DX improves (they are promising major tools improvements with their upcoming Accelerate program), I will start porting P11 to Avalonia.</p>
<p>Once we have polished Windows version of Avalonia based Playnite, I'll start working on Linux version. I don't want to make just straight port of Windows version, that wouldn't be good enough. I would really like to have Linux specific feature available on release, like Wine/Proton specific features, Epic and GOG plugins using Legendary and heroic-gogdl respectively, stuff like that.</p>
<p>To sum this up, Linux version is definitely something I plan to work on in future, it's just going to happen later than originally planned.</p>
<p>As far as macOS version, no idea about that. It's definitely not something I would look into sooner than having Linux version more or less done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see more and more support for Linux everywhere.</p>
<p>If you need an alternative right now on Linux / Steam Deck the most comparable would likely be Heroic Games Launcher and Lutris.</p>

      <title>Blender Studio announced Project DogWalk, a &#34;Micro-Game&#34; made with Godot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blender Studio, the creative unit of the free open source Blender project, recently announced work has begun on their second video game with Project DogWalk. It's going to be a small one, made to be playable in a single sitting, so they're calling it a "Micro-Game".</p>
<p>This is something I missed from <a href="https://studio.blender.org/blog/announcing-project-dogwalk/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>, thanks to a tip in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Discord</a> (there's a dedicated suggested news channel for me to pick things from you!). With it being a small game they said it's going to be centred around these points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A playtime of a single sitting.</li>
<li>Oriented around a single mechanic.</li>
<li>Extended primarily via replayability and player expression.</li>
<li>Reliant on a reusable &amp; modular asset library.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Using a "papercraft" art style, it will take place in a small snow-covered woods. As they explained: "You play as an adorable big dog who, together with their kid owner, is trying to decorate a snowman with the best things they can find nearby" they continued "While you are a force of nature that the environment cannot stop from exploring, your little companion is very easily dragged and flung around and might get stuck. It's about whacky slip-ups and building a relationship".</p>
<p>Since the Blender Game Engine they used in their first game, Yo Frankie!, no longer officially exists they're going with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> this time around.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ivGx54_X7YE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4215a99e52786e54d3cf5c7478b03cdd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ivGx54_X7YE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Godot already has pretty good support for importing from Blender, but part of this development will also allow the Blender Studio team to "research how this can be improved even further". </p>
<p>You can follow it on the <a href="https://studio.blender.org/projects/project-dogwalk/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">project website</a>.</p>

      <title>The Campsite is a short and sweet modern point-and-click adventure worth your time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for your next coffee break is The Campsite, a short but sweet modern point and click adventure that looks to be worth your time. It has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>From developer Guillem Espias they said "If you have a passion for graphic adventures but never find the time to play, this might be exactly what you’re looking for". It's about an hour long, good for casual gamers and a great starting-off point for adventure games. There's even a bit of a plot twist to make it stick in your mind after you finish.</p>
<p>More about it: "An enthusiastic adventurer is about to embark on a special mission: leading a chaotic team of unruly members in the hunt for a mysterious treasure. A vibrant night in the woods awaits, unveiling a memorable adventure, but beware—the shadows conceal a watchful presence. They are not alone..."</p>

      <title>Commandos: Origins gets an April release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Commandos: Origins from Claymore Game Studios and Kalypso Media is set for release on April 9th, where you get to see the beginning of this legendary elite force. I'm actually quite excited about this one. I spent more hours than I probably should have in the original Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, back in the 90s.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/101002351739182280gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release: “The Green Beret couldn’t have said it better with his iconic phrase ‘Consider it done,’” said Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director at Claymore Game Studios. “After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development and the invaluable community feedback from various playtests, operation ‘Release’ is a go for Commandos: Origins. We are proud and excited that players will now be able to experience the origins story of the elite unit which started this legendary franchise.” </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenging Real Time Tactical Stealth Gameplay:</strong> Make the best use of your Commandos’ <strong>unique abilities</strong>, infiltrate enemy facilities, and hit them where it hurts most before disappearing into the shadows. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An extraordinary team:</strong> Featuring <strong>6 infamous characters</strong>, each with their own storied history, banding together to form an extraordinary fighting force – the Commandos: Take control over Jack O’Hara “the Green Beret”, Thomas “the Sapper” Hancock, Francis T. “the Sniper” Woolridge, Samuel “the Driver” Brooklyn, James “the Marine” Blackwood, and Rene “the Spy” Duchamp and lead them to success.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Many paths to victory:</strong> The detailed, varied, and interactive environments offer <strong>multiple approaches</strong> to reach your goal. Sneak, climb, <strong>drive in various vehicles</strong>, or hide and creep your way to mission success! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On your mark:</strong> A modern user experience with <strong>precise and intuitive controls</strong> enables you to control the commandos with expert precision. <strong>Coordinate complex actions simultaneously</strong> to overcome heavily fortified targets. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fight on all fronts:</strong> Play through <strong>more than 10 missions</strong> in historically authentic <strong>WWII</strong> environments, spanning from the barren Arctic to the African desert, with a range of core and voluntary objectives that will require your <strong>full tactical expertise</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There is no I in team:</strong> Take on missions with a friend in the <strong>2-player cooperative multiplaye</strong>r mode, either <strong>online</strong> or via <strong>local split-screen</strong>.  </p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Paranormal point-and-click adventure Slender Threads is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your modern point and click adventures? Paranormal point-and-click adventure Slender Threads from developer Blyts looks like a good one. From the same team as Kelvin and the Infamous Machine, it promises a much darker and more ambitious tale but still features plenty of humour.</p>
<p>Fully voiced too featuring a cast some might recognise from the likes of Hades, Telltale's The Walking Dead, Unicorn Overlord, and many more. More about it: "Haunted by a prescient nightmare, traveling salesman Harvey Green wanders the peculiar seaside town of Villa Ventana in a desperate attempt to stop a series of shocking deaths—before he's next."</p>
<p>The Prologue, that's still free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1682490/Slender_Threads_Prologue/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, had a lot of positive user reviews.</p>
<p>Check out the most recent trailer below:</p>

<li>A timeless point-and-click blend of exploration, dialogue, and puzzle-solving.</li>
<li>A curious tale that melds shocking twists with absurd humor.</li>
<li>Dozens of strange, memorable characters brought to life by a cast of celebrated voice actors.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn art that combines 2D and 3D to create striking, "diorama-like" visuals.</li>

      <title>Early Access wasn&#39;t enough for Alterium Shift so it&#39;s now on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and Final Fantasy - Alterium Shift entered Early Access in 2023 but it's now back on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drattzygames/alterium-shift/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. Seems the Steam release simply wasn't good enough, so they're asking for more funds to finish the game.</p>
<p>From the Kickstarter: "We’ve already made great strides in Early Access, delivering 50% of the core game. But now, we need your support to bring the full vision of Alterium Shift to life, complete with enhanced combat, expanded content, and exciting new features. Together, let’s craft a JRPG that blends the charm of the past with the innovation of today."</p>
<p>They're hoping to raise at least $50,000, with over $40,000 pledged at time of writing and still 24 days to go. So it's quite likely this will get fully funded.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader for Steam Deck gets a store upgrade to show currently installed plugins clearly </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Decky Loader, the popular plugin system for Steam Deck / SteamOS, has a fresh release out making the plugin store a bit more useful. Be sure to check out my full guide to get you going: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-set-up-decky-loader-on-steam-deck-steamos-for-easy-plugins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to set up Decky Loader on Steam Deck / SteamOS for easy plugins</a>.</p>
<p>With the 3.1.3 stable release out now: when you go into the store it will actually properly show you what you already have installed, which it didn't do well before. Plugins you have installed will have their button state <em>Reinstall</em> if you already have it, along with a tick on the current version you have installed.</p>

      <title>Valve ban advertising-based business models on Steam, no forced adverts like in mobile games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: 10/02/25, 11:29 UTC</strong> - Turns out this was actually <em>already</em> a rule that Valve had (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). It was listed on their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pricing</a> page but this change has made it a lot more visible with its own dedicated section. Still, good to have a reminder this awful practice isn't allowed on Steam.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve have updated the developer guidelines for releasing a game on Steam, making it clear that the scourge of mobile gaming advertising-based business models are not going to work on Steam.</p>
<p>There's a new <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">advertising page</a> in the public Steamworks documentation that goes over what is and isn't allowed. What's allowed is as you might expect like games can have real-world product placement, cross-promotions with other games are fine and paid advertising outside of Steam is also fine.</p>
<p>What they've done here is completely ban paid advertising getting in your way inside the games. As their rules state now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not Supported</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising. If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase "paid app," or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/microtransactions" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Microtransactions</a> or <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/application/dlc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Downloadable Content (DLC)</a>.</li>
<li>Developers should not use advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game.</li>
<li>Developers should not charge other developers for access to Steam features. These include sale pages, bundles, store pages, franchise pages, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">onboarding</a> page has also been updated to add "Applications with advertising-based business models" to the list, which also includes their previous ban on "blockchain technology that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs" <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/valve-banning-games-that-allow-exchanging-cryptocurrencies-or-nfts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that came in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>What this doesn't do is stop developers throwing up a big advert for another of their games, that's fine, this is specifically about the business model you often see on mobile platforms. Imagine when you go into a game, want to unlock a feature or do anything, but it tells you to watch an advert first before you can proceed. That's what Valve are putting a stop to here.</p>
<p>I've never personally experienced a game that did that on Steam, although I'm sure some developers have tried it. But it's a huge and annoying thing in mobile games. Glad to see it just won't ever be a thing on Steam.</p>
<p>Valve have done a lot of really consumer-positive changes over the last few years like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">making sure developers note kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, a recent change of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-now-warns-on-steam-pages-if-an-early-access-game-hasnt-been-updated-in-a-long-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting Early Access games that aren't being updated</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-getting-proper-season-pass-support-with-clearer-guidelines-and-refunds-for-cancellations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proper Season Pass system that includes more complete info</a> and refunds for missing DLC content and more.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-24 released with a new save game detection feature (and now GE-Proton 9-25 too)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 10/02/25</strong>: something that happens quite often with GE-Proton, a quick hotfix release is out with <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-25</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOTFIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>update Dragon Age Inquisition xinput patch introduced in GE-Proton9-11 to fix a regression that caused performance issue in Black Desert Online and possibly other games: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4676" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">doitsujin/dxvk#4676</a> (thanks loathingKernel and Blisto)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>GE-Proton 9-24 is out now bringing with it the usual assortment of fixes, plus as interesting change that will help games detect saves from other games.</p>
<p>This new save detection feature helps with the likes of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and others that can use save data from a previous game either for sequels or new editions. It does this by scanning and reading through all Steam Library folders for a correct app ID to link them up. This was included in an update for <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">umu-protonfixes</a>, part of a database of specific game fixes for running Proton inside and outside Steam (like with Heroic / Lutris).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other changes for GE-Proton 9-24 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added patch that adds PROTON_PREFER_SDL option. If <code class="inline-code">PROTON_PREFER_SDL=1</code> is set proton will not prefer hidraw and instead will expose both sdl and hidraw. it can fix input in a few games when not using steam input</li>
<li>Added patch that adds PROTON_NO_WM_DECORATION (and WINE_NO_WM_DECORATION) option. If <code class="inline-code">PROTON_NO_WM_DECORATION=1</code> is set, it sets <code class="inline-code">WINE_NO_WM_DECORATION=1</code> which will disable window decorations. This can fix an issue where if clicking on a window border in some games in borderless window mode it would click through the border straight to the desktop. By disabling the window decorations it removes the pixel offset caused by them, which is what causes the mouse click confusion.</li>
<li>Removed previously disabled nvidia latency reflex patches as they have now all been merged with the exception of the winevulkan patches. Winevulkan patches are now applied -- nvidia latency reflex should now work where available.</li>
<li>updated wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d to latest upstream</li>
<li>updated dxvk-nvapi to latest upstream</li>
<li>import steamclient changes from upstream</li>
<li>import vrclient changes from upstream</li>
<li>import proton changes from upstream</li>
<li>fixed configure script issue with autodetection of podman or docker not working, --container-engine option no longer needs specifying during building</li>
<li>ccache enabled by default in configure script, --enable-ccache option no longer needs specifying during building</li>
</ul>

      <title>Everwarder is a fresh tower defense roguelite hybrid about clearing the darkness</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everwarder asks: how long will your light last? Not very long in some of my attempts. It's a fresh feeling spin that merges tower defense with a bit of roguelite action together, as you attempt to break through the darkness.</p>
<p>You assume the role of a mystical guardian charged with protecting a crystal that houses their trapped friend. Darkness expands, enemies emerge and it's up to you to sort out the defences. It's not a plain tower defense game, since you have direct free movement to float around and explore too. You're also not just protecting this crystal but trying to expand through a changing map.</p>
<p>As the developer explains: "Every run presents unique challenges and evolving mechanics, ensuring no two sessions feel the same. Players unlock new abilities, artifacts, and tools, with opportunities to create overpowered builds. Each decision—whether upgrading units, collecting resources, or combining artifacts —matters. Failure is simply another step forward in the game’s overarching progression system, where resources earned unlock new unit tiers, artifacts, and upgrades, allowing players to return stronger and last longer against the darkness."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cpq3nv2fLdQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64ef86587cdd9c610b568497d93df1be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cpq3nv2fLdQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a really vibrant neon-infused style, with a nice little intro to pull you in and after the tutorial it really opens up into something you'll likely end up spending quite a number of hours in. The way you mine through the darkness to reveal enemies and progress through the map is pretty fun, as is dealing with the different enemy types with their strengths and weaknesses requiring some good planning to deal with.</p>
<p>The upgrade system is an interesting one here too. You get to upgrade towers directly during a run when you build up enough resources, you also get the meta spiritual limbo world inside portals you find to upgrade various things further and then there's another layer on top of that where you collect enough of a certain resource to evolve yourself. The evolving system gives you a choice of three cards to buff a particular type of tower, but it will also help affect other types on future evolutions. There's so many things going on in this one. Enemies evolve too, the longer they're going and the more time they have to get to you, the stronger they will end up as they too can transform into a stronger tier.</p>
<p>While you can upgrade your "towers", you also get overall upgrades</p>
<p>While quite simple in terms of the style, what the developer has achieved with it is impressive. Thanks to some wonderful music and sound effects for everything plus lots of little animations going on, it really all flows together nicely that it's real joy to watch when it gets going.</p>
<p>"With Everwarder, I wanted to create something that breaks away from the static nature of traditional tower defense games,” said Oleh, the solo developer of qLate. “The core of this game is that you control the flow of enemies, making it entirely your responsibility if they overwhelm your defenses.”</p>
<p>I would say they've succeeded on their vision here.</p>
<p><em>The Linux version tested works perfec</em>tly.</p>

      <title>Please don&#39;t distract me I&#39;m trying to dig a big hole over here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can you truly call yourself a "gamer" if you haven't at least spent a good few hours doing nothing but digging a hole? I have answered the call and my hole has been dug.</p>
<p>I am of course talking about A Game About Digging A Hole that just today released on Steam from developer Cyberwave, who is also currently working on Solarpunk.</p>
<p>With your battery-powered shovel in-hand, you begin — very, very slowly. Tap tap tap, dig dig dig and away you go digging your little hole. Just uh, don't ignore those battery warnings like I did as a test, say goodbye to your ore and health. It's a game after all, the developer had to gamify basic digging right? There's no great big special hook here, you really are just digging a hole in the back garden of your newly purchased house. Although, there's apparently some buried treasure there and perhaps something you might wake up that's a little spooky.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4pCvvyzFlXA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/908945083bd531db8f2cbf966e6eae91.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4pCvvyzFlXA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can already feel your judging eyes as you read this. Is this a time where I should be reconsidering some life choices? Sat here just clicking away digging a deep dark hole. I'm getting flashbacks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/please-save-me-i-have-discovered-leaf-blower-revolution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Leaf Blower Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>What is it about games doing some of the most boring things that we end up spending our time with? It reminds of PowerWash Simulator as well, a game I've spent far too much time on. I could clean my own house and garden, but no — it's a video game so it's somehow entertaining! Here I get somewhat similar feeling with the repetition of digging, grabbing ores, selling ore, upgrading and repeat. Progress!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14052217321738932601gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Progress is good! After a bit you get to upgrade your shovel so it makes bigger holes, and you can get a bigger battery to dig for longer, a bigger backpack for more ore. Yes! I am a digging maniac. Rock and stone! Then you get your jetpack, and suddenly it feels that little bit more fun, but drains your digging battery too — dammit. I need to dig more!</p>
<p><em>At least here there is an ultimate goal: finding out whatever the heck is at the bottom. Wait, is there a bottom?</em></p>
<p>Hold on, now my little radar is pinging something, I'm getting close to something, how exciting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16705103411738932755gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It was a bag of money! Excellent! Now I can upgrade my bag to collect more ore, sell it all to upgrade again and then dig some more. Clearly I am but a simple creature because this is has grabbed my full attention.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell it works perfectly on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-4</a>. See you in the hole, watch your step.</p>

      <title>Cast n Chill is a gorgeous looking pixel-art idle fishing game coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revealed in a press email today is Cast n Chill from developer Wombat Brawler. A game where you explore serene lakes, rivers, and oceans. Catch rare fish, upgrade your gear and reel in legendary catches - with your loyal pup by your side.</p>
<p>I don't play too many games like this, as idle games aren't usually my cup, but some of them are genuinely great to kill some time with. Cast n Chill caught my attention with the really lovely artwork plus it has both active and idle modes so you can do as much or as little as you want to chill with it.</p>
<p>Their first announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R1W0HcyuQAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5a6160e4b001dd6814593ea85ac3634.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R1W0HcyuQAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade:</strong> Catch fish, sell for profit and <strong>upgrade your gear to catch rarer fish species.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explore: </strong>Relax at your favourite fishing spot.</li>
<li><strong>Modes:</strong> In <strong>active mode</strong>, cast and reel in quicker to speed up production.</li>
<li>If you'd rather Cast n Chill you can let <strong>passive mode</strong> take over and return when ready to see what your catches of the day were (with <strong>offline progression</strong> too).</li>
<li>Cast n Chill on a second monitor or use the <strong>resizable window</strong> for single monitor setups.</li>
<li><strong>Collect:</strong> Complete your collection of 100+ common, rare and legendary fish species including fresh and salt water.</li>
<li><strong>Pupper! </strong>Don't forget to bring your loyal pup along for the ride!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This was revealed as part of the ongoing Steam Idler Fest that runs until February 10th, and is apparently a hit across Japanese social media according to the developer.</p>
<p>You'll need Proton to run it on Linux but I don't foresee any issues there. The developer said it's set to release in June.</p>

      <title>BAFTA-nominated narrative adventure Vampire Therapist gets a Couples Therapy DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Therapist is a narrative adventure / visual novel with a sprinkle of dark comedy that was nominated for a BAFTA in 2024, and now it's expanded with the Vampire Therapist - Couples Therapy DLC. The game has Native Linux support, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Therapist: Couples Therapy</em> will explore themes of revolt, duty to humanity, and the complications that can arise from age gaps. What's a few hundred years between lovers? Well, as you can imagine it can cause all sorts of problems and that's what you'll be dealing with here. You slip back into the role of Sam Walls, a reformed cowboy turned accomplished therapist.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xjVPzVaSWVI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/acdcda4efdd3e55725678efa159b15e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xjVPzVaSWVI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about the content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam has his work cut out for him as he seeks to help two vampires, battling with both domestic and personal struggles, as well as social discontentment following their demises during bloody revolutions in France and Iran. </p>
<p>But that’s not all! This juicy new helping of content takes place during the annual Bachfest in Leipzig — home of Johann Sebastian Bach— where a ghost of Leipzig haunts the streets. It’s Sam’s job to track down the troubled soul between therapy sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In a time of political turmoil, we hope <em>Vampire Therapist: Couples Therapy </em>will help players process difficult questions about the citizen's role in civil society and find a little respite in love and compassion. And if all else fails, we have vampire fart jokes.” said Cyrus Nemati, Creative Director of Little Bat Games. </p>
<p>The DLC is to launch today for £2.49 / €2.99/ $2.99.</p>

      <title>A deck-builder for busy people, Bramble Royale: A Meteorfall Story plans full Steam Deck support for launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Slothwerks have announced their upcoming turn-based card-battler Bramble Royale: A Meteorfall Story will have full Steam Deck support at launch. It's a faced-paced deck-builder for busy people apparently. <em>Did they make this for me?</em></p>
<p>Here's what they said on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372950/Bramble_Royale_A_Meteorfall_Story/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the goals during development was to have a quality Steam Deck implementation right at launch, instead of being added on after the fact. That meant rethinking some of the UI and putting in hours of play on the Steam Deck to iron our potential issues: small text, missing support, etc... The result is a polished implementation that quickly became one of our favorite ways to play.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have a Steam Deck or prefer to play with a gamepad - let us know what you think later this month during Steam Next Fest! You'll have the opportunity to try a brand new Bramble Royale demo with full Steam Deck support then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R1t0fevRNJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb474b823d425476912ee0ede818489f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R1t0fevRNJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: Play cards, maneuver your allies, and brawl in fast-paced battles.</p>
<p>Winning the Bramble Royale isn't about fighting fair - it's about winning. The crowd demands spectacle! Take advantage of Wild Cards to change the rules of the brawl, exploiting them to your advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix-and-match multiple upgrades on a single card to build overpowered combos.</li>
<li>Impress the crowd and power-up in battle by completing challenging feats.</li>
<li>Build your dream team of 3 heroes (from a pool of 8), each with their own unique set of cards.</li>
<li>Discover more than 200 cards to turn the tides of battle in your favor.</li>

      <title>Take-Two CEO believes AI will actually increase employment and productivity</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have to hand it to the people in suits at the top, they all sure do love AI, and the latest to be bullish about it is Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry</a>, Zelnick was asked a few general questions but AI bit was saved for last.</p>
<p><em>It's important to understand that Take-Two are a big name considering they own the likes of  Rockstar Games, Zynga and 2K.</em></p>
<p><strong>GamesIndustry asked: </strong>"Another hot topic at the moment, and you've mentioned it in the past, is AI's role in the industry. What role does it play in Take-Two's strategy going forward and are there any guardrails you think the industry needs to be considering in terms of AI?"</p>
<p><strong>Zelnick replied: </strong>"Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing. Machine learning, machines don't learn. Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever. I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment.</p>
<p>To the contrary, the history of digital technology is that technology increases employment, increases productivity, increases GDP and I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI.</p>
<p>But in terms of the guardrails, if you mean, you know, not infringing on other people's intellectual property by, you know, poaching their LLMs, yeah, we're not going to do that. Moreover, if we did, we couldn't protect that, we wouldn't be able to protect our own IP. So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own. Apart from that, I really can't think of any new guardrails that need to be implemented."</p>
<p>Like it or not, this appears to be where the industry is going. So much so that since January 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve now require AI disclosures from developers</a> on Steam.

      <title>Civilization VII gets a mixed reception on Steam, Firaxis say they&#39;re listening and put up a small roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems it's increasingly rare to have a major game release that doesn't come filled with lots of issues. The latest is Sid Meier's Civilization VII from Firaxis Games.</p>
<p>The game isn't actually released proper yet, it's currently in Advanced Access, for people who got hooked in by the FOMO and paid more. The game actually releases for everyone on February 11th. Which is also when I'll get access, since 2K didn't reply to my mails about a review key I purchased it personally - so my thoughts on how it runs will come later.</p>
<p>As for Steam, the Advanced Access period saw a peak of 62,931 players which shows it's pretty popular in terms of sales quite clearly for even the more expensive version of the game. Unfortunately for Firaxis, less than 50% of people putting up a review gave it a positive score pointing out a great many problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11274934931738923277gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Reading through the reviews it ranges from people pointing out a "horrible UI" to many saying how "barebones" and "unfinished" it feels. Even lots of the positive user reviews are pointing out the same issues, so it's clear there's problems here.</p>
<p>This has pushed the developer to issue a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on the situation with a small roadmap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prioritizing UI Improvements:</strong> Our top priority is improving the UI. We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more. We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Implementing Community-Requested Features:</strong> Several key features that we've seen you ask for will be included in upcoming patches as free updates, and we'll continue to work with the community to improve and add to the game. We're still working on exact timing, but can share the following items are being prioritized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<strong>Rolling Out Quality-of-Life Updates in Patch 1.1.0 (Deploying in March):</strong> Work is already well underway on Patch 1.1.0, which includes fixes and adjustments that were already on our radar. This list includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes.</p>

<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for February 7th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds looks unplayable on Steam Deck but good on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like Monster Hunter Wilds may be just too much for the little Steam Deck, after testing out the newly released Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark mode. But Desktop Linux is looking good.</p>
<p>We're rapidly approaching the release on February 28th, so no doubt plenty of people are keen to know how it runs. Given that Monster Hunter is an incredibly popular series of games. I'm here to save you a bit of time buying and downloading to some potential disappointment.</p>
<p>CAPCOM released this benchmark mode on February 5th which they said gives you a "near-launch version of the game" inside it. You don't play anything, it's just a benchmark to show how it will run. It does offer to let you change various settings to see how your system runs so you can find that sweet spot. However, the benchmark is a little <em>deceptive</em>, as it includes cut-scenes in the scores. Once it goes into the proper gameplay, the performance drops a fair bit.</p>
<h5>Steam Deck</h5>
<p>Let's get the bad news out of the way shall we? Testing with Proton Experimental (and Proton 9.0-4), for the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> the situation is just plain <em>bad</em>. I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, this appears to be pretty much unplayable going by the benchmark. The shader optimization stage before you even get to the menu takes a lifetime too.</p>
<p>Setting it into the <em>lowest</em> possible settings <em>without</em> frame generation and <em>without</em> upscaling gave a clear sub 30FPS experience (it hovered a lot around 20FPS), with quite a few stutters and big drops. In places it almost looked like a slideshow as it went right down to 10FPS and below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7715975381738849063gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7715975381738849063gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2816095111738849064gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2816095111738849064gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam Deck, no Upscaling and no Frame Generation</em></p>
<p>So next up, trying it with AMD FSR upscaling set to Ultra Performance. Here, we do see it get a little better but still not very playable, still constantly below 30FPS with some huge dips down and the visual quality of course is even worse. It looks actually hilarious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5666793161738849534gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5666793161738849534gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3182872661738849536gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3182872661738849536gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam Deck, with AMD FSR Ultra Performance but no Frame Generation</em></p>
<p>You may think "what about Frame Generation everyone is hyping up on Steam Deck", which is an option you can try, and does increase the FPS. The problem with Frame Generation though is that if the game is <em>not</em> performing particularly well to begin with, it will cause various other problems like <em>massive</em> spikes in the frame timing resulting in a <em>very</em> poor experience. Just look at the mess on the frame timings in the below pictures (green wiggly lines), you want that to be as low and <em>flat</em> as possible</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12541104421738850081gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12541104421738850081gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10774842301738850082gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10774842301738850082gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam Deck, with AMD FSR set to Ultra Performance and Frame Generation On</em></p>
<p>Not only that, even just the benchmark on my Steam Deck LCD caused the Steam Deck to abruptly reboot.</p>
<p>Unless something happens, like the developer doing some specific low-end optimizations, Monster Hunter Wilds is pretty much <em>unplayable</em> on the Steam Deck.</p>
<h5>Desktop Linux</h5>
<p>How about <strong>Desktop Linux</strong>? The situation there is, thankfully, much better. There seems to be no issue with Proton running the game. As expected really. My system is an AMD Ryzen 5800x with an AMD Radeon 6800 XT on Kubuntu 24.10 at 2560x1440 resolution.</p>
<p>On the High preset, without any upscaling, it averaged 62FPS. A bit deceptive though, as mentioned previously, since there's a long cut-scene included.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12167158341738846036gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12167158341738846036gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Hunter Wilds on Desktop Linux, High Settings, No Upscaling</em></p>
<p>Actual gameplay here had plenty of parts that were above 60FPS, but there's also lots of clear drops below 60FPS on these settings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15619722971738846105gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15619722971738846105gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>For example, changing over to using AMD FSR on Balanced while keeping it on High settings gave about an extra 10FPS in some of the lower performing scenes. A lot of other scenes were hitting well over 80FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15385018821738850584gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15385018821738850584gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Hunter Wilds on Desktop Linux, High Settings, AMD FSR Balanced</em></p>
<p>So still not a steady 60FPS, this is a game that with my GPU (Radeon RX 6800 XT) on Linux, at 2560x1440 will probably need to drop to Medium to have a better overall experience.</p>
<p>Dropping it to Medium with AMD FSR also bumped to Performance and we're much closer to 60FPS here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18315850641738851229gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18315850641738851229gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Hunter Wilds on Desktop Linux, Medium Settings, AMD FSR Performance</em></p>
<p>So Steam Deck is definitely a nope for now, but Desktop Linux it will absolutely run with Proton it just depends on your settings. If you use the correct settings to match up with your system, you should be good to go on Linux at release day.</p>

      <title>The huge free Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms RTS just got upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the always impressive OpenRA game engine, the standalone and entirely free fan game Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms RTS has a brand new release out.</p>
<p>For those of you who continue to love your classic RTS game, this is probably one of the best. It combines together Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and expands upon it further. It includes Allies, Soviets, GDI, Nod and the Scrin each with their own sub-factions with their own units, powers and upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19576941361738843537gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The latest update brings in all these upgrades to the overall game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Campaign progress tracking. Mission browser records which missions have been completed as well as the date, time taken, difficulty, version, and game speed.</li>
<li>New music track "Malevolence".</li>
<li>Co-op version of the mission "Reckoning".</li>
<li>Increased the size of the final campaign mission.</li>
<li>Added 10x RAGL 16 maps along with 7x more 1v1 maps, 1x 3v3 map, 1x 4v4 and 1x FFA Europe map.</li>
<li>Condition applying abilities no longer delayed until next full cell of movement, increasing the responsiveness of Gyro Stabilizers, Defense Matrix, Mind Blast, Mind Spark, Hypercharge, Advanced Optics, Decoy Projectors, Chaos Drone, Mobile EMP.</li>
<li>Bounties are now taken from a pool that first has to be accumulated by a player getting kills. Bounty increased from 10% to 15% of unit value. Added bounty column to economy stats panel.</li>
<li>Most previously uncrushable infantry (SEALs, Tesla Troopers, Desolators, Zone Troopers/Raiders/Defenders, Cryo Troopers, Chem Warriors, Templar) can now be crushed by any vehicles that can crush walls (e.g. Mammoth Tanks, Tripods etc.). Commando units, Brutes and Enforcers are now the only fully uncrushable infantry.</li>
<li>All superweapons do increased damage vs buildings (so they can now kill an undamaged Construction Yard / War Factory).</li>
<li>Added "Harvester under attack" announcement.</li>
<li>Reduced mine damage, increased splash radius, added TankBuster modifier (+33% damage vs tanks).</li>
<li>Oil Refinery no longer affects cost of buildings/defenses.</li>
<li>In competitive multi-queue, Service Depot &amp; equivalents grant reduced cost of additional production structures (equivalent to radar).</li>
<li>Added 1.33x speed option in replays.</li>
<li>Added produced unit values tab to observer info panel.</li>
<li>Show times in build order tab in observer info panel.</li>
<li>Added &amp; improved unit compositions for campaign AI.</li>
<li>Allow 10 hotkeys for support powers (up from 6).</li>
<li>Targets are validated when activating support powers that apply conditions (e.g. Iron Curtain) so the power isn't used up if targets are destroyed before the condition can be applied.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus, there's a whole lot of faction-specific balancing changes and upgrades as well. There's some new voice lines, new artwork, new units to try out and so much more. Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms is a truly impressive project and one I really love jumping back into.</p>
<p>OpenRA itself also has a new version coming since that had a first <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/openra-for-classic-rts-games-like-red-alert-has-a-new-playtest-with-enhanced-visuals-revamped-map-editor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">test build released back in November 2024</a>, and had a small follow-up test release in December 2024.</p>
<p>We have a lot to thank EA for since they released Command &amp; Conquer 1, Red Alert 1 and Tiberian Sun as freeware many years ago.</p>
<p>You can follow it via <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/command-conquer-combined-arms" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mod DB</a> and see the full changelog on <a href="https://github.com/Inq8/CAmod/releases/tag/1.05" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>

      <title>Spooky drone-operating derelict spaceship explorer Duskers is getting a sequel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Misfits Attic who made A Virus Named TOM and the more popular spooky drone-operating derelict spaceship explorer game Duskers have released a video going over three new games, one of which is a sequel to Duskers.</p>
<p>Well, they actually say it's a "spiritual successor" but going by the footage they showed, it looks very much like a full sequel to me. Currently noted to be called "Humanity 2.0" in the video, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can I say? I still love Duskers, and we've started work on a spiritual successor. Don't think scavenging parts from derelict spaceships and upgrading your drones was enough? What about carving up those derelict ships and adding portions of them to your own previously non-existent ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer continues to reel off a few other additions like drones being your actual crew, helping you fight off other ships and drones having little personalities. All progress towards rebooting humanity apparently.</p>
<p>See it and their other upcoming games in the below video:</p>

      <title>Toy soldier FPS battleground Mini Royale releases in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The online shooter Mini Royale is set for an Early Access release on March 27th, bringing with it a toy soldier battleground with multiple game modes.</p>
<p>It will have a classic Battle Royale mode with a shrinking zone, Colour Conquest where four teams battle it out and when you die you join the enemy team and classic deathmatch. Plus it has both first and third-person modes for each game mode.</p>
<p>I tried out the demo <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/mini-royale-is-a-battle-royale-with-toy-soldiers-and-fun-game-modes-demo-available-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in October 2024</a>, where it was already pretty fun and they've continued to update it with <em>lots</em> of improvements since then. The Colour Conquest mode was a particular favourite of mine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qd4kGADVIFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ec68f087b53545973d2c2d9d9e09203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qd4kGADVIFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Mini Royale has a <em>lot</em> to like about it but it's incredibly difficult for a new online shooter to break through. People who play online shooters tend to stick to the same few, with a lot of newer online shooters failing pretty quickly. Hopefully this will fare just a little bit better since it's trying to do something a bit different to a lot of others. It will also be free to play with optional cosmetics via a season pass, so at least people can easily jump in and try it.</p>
<p>There is a demo listed but the playtest servers aren't live right now. Going by the in-game countdown it will get another playtest in around 8 days.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support with Easy Anti-Cheat enabled.</p>

      <title>Portal 2 gets a compatibility update for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/left-4-dead-2-gets-a-compatibility-update-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated Left 4 Dead 2</a> with a compatibility fix for Linux, and it seems they've done the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/620/view/539971003577532592" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">same</a> for their popular puzzle game Portal 2.</p>
<p>The announcements for the two games were only 1 minute apart, and both mentioned simply "Fixed a compatibility issue that was causing a crash on Linux clients" so it's likely it's the exact same fix. This was due to the glibc v2.41 update release that was causing problems on Arch Linux, and would then cause issues when other Linux distributions update. </p>
<p>More info in <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/6978#issuecomment-2633738175" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this linked comment</a> from the Valve Source 1 game GitHub bug tracker.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5418480141738836082gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see some Valve games get updated quickly to ensure they keep running on Linux.</p>

      <title>Experience slow-burn atmospheric dread in the typing horror game DEAD LETTER DEPT.</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DEAD LETTER DEPT. comes from the 2-person studio Belief Engine, a slow-burn typing horror game that will fill you with dread. As the developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/linux-fascinates-and-terrifies-the-dev-of-dead-letter-dept-but-theyre-supporting-it-anyway/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced previously</a> it comes with full Linux / SteamOS support, even though "Linux fascinates and terrifies".</p>
<p>A quite unusual horror game where you take a temp job that tasks you with data-entry-like work. You'll be typing up the words and addresses on mail &amp; letters that were not deliverable, either due to bad handwriting or other odd reasons (sounds exactly like one of my previous jobs). It gets weird as time goes on with various stories that begin to emerge. It won't be long before you get that sinking feeling.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uCByepaHNyg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b8ce7ed72f9903de044681887776c8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uCByepaHNyg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Working in a dingy warehouse, isolated from anyone and everyone, your only connection to the outside world are glimpses of letters that couldn't reach their destination. As time goes on, working conditions become questionable and dreamlike. Oddities and cracks begin to appear. Making money for rent is important, but at what cost."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USE YOUR KEYBOARD to type in various prompts, and attempt to decipher damaged images.</li>
<li>MULTIPLE ENDINGS &amp; buried secrets to uncover.</li>
<li>NO TWO PLAYTHROUGHS are exactly the same (Estimated playtime: 120min per run).</li>
<li>A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MAIL to voyeur through, and catch glimpses into other lives.</li>
<li>ATMOSPHERIC HORROR MOOD with rich sound designed to crawl under your skin.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Paradox Interactive acquires Haemimont Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced, along with their latest earning reports, that they've entered into an agreement to acquire Haemimont Games.</p>
<p>The deal hasn't been completed just yet they said they expect it to go through "within a few days". The purchasing price was done via "an upfront cash consideration and a performance-based earnout of similar size that is to be paid out over the coming years" but they're not disclosing how much. This will make Haemimont Games a wholly owned subsidiary of Paradox.</p>
<p>Seems like an overall pretty good fit with Haemimont Games previously developing Surviving Mars in 2018 that was published by Paradox. They also more recently released Jagged Alliance 3 and Stranded: Alien Dawn both in 2023. Earlier titles included Tropico 3, Tropico 4 and Tropico 5.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p><em>“We are very happy to welcome Haemimont Games to Paradox!” said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox. “They bring a tight-knit team with long experience in developing management games with many well received projects in their portfolio. Moreover, they have a strong creative streak, technology developed for their niche, a new IP in development and a strong culture that fits Paradox’s way of working. We have strong faith in their team and leadership, and our main focus now is to ensure that they can continue to create great games under new ownership.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We're delighted to become a part of the Paradox family!” said Gabriel Dobrev, Founder of Haemimont Games. “The cultural fit between our companies is remarkable, and we already feel at home. This partnership empowers us to push the boundaries of our games, delivering deeper and more intense experiences to our players. It also opens new horizons for our team, technology, and creative processes, which we're eager to explore. Expect amazing new games from us!”</em></p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead 2 gets a compatibility update for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A recent update to glibc in version 2.41 appears to have been causing issues with Left 4 Dead 2, which Valve have solved in a fresh update.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/550/view/521956605068050680" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> simply mention "Fixed a compatibility issue that was causing a crash on Linux clients". Digging deeper, the issue was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/6978" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on Valve's official GitHub for Source 1 games. Going by the comments, it appears the issue appeared with the glibc v2.41 release. More info in <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/6978#issuecomment-2633738175" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this linked comment</a>.</p>
<p>The issue came up on Arch Linux since that's a rolling release distribution and updates come in quite early, and is now solved, so when other Linux distributions also update they should see Left 4 Dead 2 continue to work.</p>

      <title>Blocking Linux / Steam Deck in Apex Legends led to a &#39;meaningful reduction&#39; in cheaters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in October 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Respawn announced they were blocking Apex Legends</a> on Linux platforms (including Steam Deck). Apparently this has worked quite well for them.</p>
<p>In the latest <em>Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update</em> video on YouTube they went over various details on what they're doing to improve the game. Steven Ferreira, Game Director on Apex Legends, mentions in the video at about 2 minutes in: "A couple of months ago we blocked Linux access to Apex. And we are pleased to report that we've seen a meaningful reduction in the amount of cheating recently."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HRAKqGo_wBE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/412e4757c9f90ed1f8f899e0b57132a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Back in early December 2024, they also made a post on X/Twitter to show a continued reduction in cheating:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14315659451738779292gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Does this mean Linux users / players are cheaters or cheat <em>more</em> than players on other platforms? Well, no. The issue is mainly that cheat makers like to run their exploits on Linux whenever they can, so blocking Linux as a platform is the easiest and bluntest tool game developers have to combat the problem. On Windows, they have kernel-level access for their anti-cheat that they don't have on Linux as well (although the benefit of that is debatable).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/facepunch-put-out-a-fresh-statement-on-rust-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same situation happened with survival game Rust</a>, as noted by developer Alistair McFarlane back in 2022:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we discontinued linux support in 2019, one of the core reasons was how the cheating community was exploiting the Linux platform. That's not to say that cheating was super widespread on Linux, but it was safer for cheat developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably that's why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online was blocked</a> as well even though it also uses anti-cheat that supports Linux.</p>
<p>Anti-cheat is just going to remain an issue for Linux gaming for a long time it seems, until we see more Steam Decks getting sold and regularly used, along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS expanding onto more devices</a>. It's going to be the big elephant in the room <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">if Valve did build a living room Steam Console</a>.</p>

      <title>What Valve would need to do to make a Steam Console a success </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the most <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-latest-valve-steam-console-rumour-with-amd-rdna4-can-be-safely-ignored-heres-why/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent rumour of a Steam Console was complete junk</a>, it did get me thinking on what Valve would need to do to make a Steam Console / Steam Machine actually successful.</p>
<p>Valve, thankfully, have a lot more experience now. We're a long way from the original failure of Steam Machines, with the Steam Deck selling multiple millions and continuing to go strong. It's spent multiple years in the top revenue lists on Steam at this point so Valve really did well there. Can they actually move their experience over to a new living room box though? There's quite a <em>lot</em> they would need to actually do, which is part of why I think it's still probably a long way off.</p>
<p>For starters: one single main configuration. This is the strength of the Steam Deck! Having one main model. Okay, there's technically two with the LCD and OLED, but in terms of performance they're basically the same. Different storage sizes is fine and something I would expect. Don't make Microsoft's mistake with the Series S and Series X, with the Series S causing issues. Sticking to performance one model would be the most obvious thing here. It's easier and cheaper for Valve on production and far less confusion for consumers then either.</p>
<p>Availability too is an issue. It's not good enough to be just available on the Steam store, they need to partner with some retail stores. This is something that holds back the Steam Deck a bit. At least they can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-white-and-steam-deck-australia-have-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">finally ship to Australia now though</a>. You need regular folks to be able to just walk into a store and pick one up.</p>
<p>Now we need to talk about Steam Big Picture Mode (Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck / SteamOS) and the Steam Store experience because — it's pretty rough. The UI as a whole is generally on the <em>buggy</em> side even on the best of days, this is something Valve would seriously need to put some dedicated full-time effort into sorting. This just wouldn't fly for the masses that go for living room consoles. The Xbox, PlayStation and Switch are all <em>incredibly</em> streamlined. Compared with the experience on the Steam Deck, it's just far messier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/784839831738771415gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Store on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>I've lost count of the amount of times the UI has lost the position of where I was when flicking between screens, which is seriously irritating, or when it gives you that dreaded error screen where the UI has just crashed after Steam Client updates.</p>
<p>A <em>better</em> game Verified system. With the current Steam Deck Verified, Valve are basically doing what they can to at least give you <em>some</em> sort of idea of a game working or not. It has a fair amount of issues, like games clearly having the wrong rating here and there but the very idea of Verified or Playable for a living room box would probably need to be gone. Perhaps I'm wrong there, and the general masses would be willing to put up with more issues, but I wouldn't have thought so.</p>
<p>Valve don't seem to apply the ratings the same across various titles. Some note they're Unsupported on Steam Deck due to performance, yet we see Verified titles coming with massive performance problems. Valve's verification system would need to be more in-depth on their end, tighter and just better controlled for it not to cause a fair bit of outrage if a Steam Console went on to sell well.</p>
<p>Realistically, that's a tall order though. Steam has how many thousands of games? Just in 2024 alone Steam saw nearly 19,000 games getting released.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with their existing verification system, a lot of it <em>would</em> translate to new hardware. Something to remember here though is that unlike traditional consoles, games wouldn't be made specially for it. Just like the Steam Deck right now, you would be either running a game built for Windows PCs through Proton or a Native Linux game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/35872441738771316gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Library on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Still, a strength of Valve's compatibility layer Proton and their Linux Runtime, is that they do at least have a sort-of stable environment to do these compatibility checks. They already add various special game-specific tweaks, and if the game runs with Proton on Steam Deck or another Linux system, it should also work on a Steam Console. But this whole verified situation would only get more <em>complex</em> with another full system of their own thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>As incredible as Proton is, there's problems there as well. I just don't think it's quite ready for such a big push as a full Steam Console. We still see lots of games releasing with issues where they don't run in Proton, or end up breaking repeatedly with updates.</p>
<p>Thinking more on that point, pulling in various major developers for the launch and have them get their games ready for it. Something Valve tried with the original Steam Machines, but with Proton to run Windows games it makes that a whole lot simpler.</p>
<p>We don't even know how they plan to handle any compatibility listings for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS</a> yet, if they plan to at all. I asked previously, and got <em>no reply</em> from either Valve or Lenovo on that. I assume it would be down to Lenovo, as Valve won't want to be responsible for every system from every vendor on compatibility ratings.</p>
<p>We come now to the biggest issue though — anti-cheat. If something like this is to be a true success in the eyes of the general public, this is the huge one. Right now, we have no solution to this issue. But with more users comes more support, so eventually game developers and anti-cheat makers would be<em> forced</em> to adapt somehow.<br/>
<em>Note: We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our own page tracking anti-cheat compatibility</a>.</em></p>
<p>Just imagine for a moment all the people picking up their fancy new Steam Console to find out they can't play <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fortnite</a>, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Battlefield, EA sports games and the list goes on. They're all massively popular games, even if you my dear reader are not bothered by them, they're pretty much essential for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18731896531738771511gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>There's no doubt numerous other things I'm missing here, this is just me getting some thoughts down, some wants and needs. There's also the subject of streaming media apps like Netflix, Disney+, YouTube and so on. Yeah I know, it's supposed to be a gaming machine and the focus should be on that but people have come to <em>expect</em> support for all of it together.</p>
<p>Oh, of course, the essential part — a <em>good</em> bundled controller. You need something to actually play games. While Steam Input supports tons of different controllers from all sorts of hardware vendors, Valve will need something <em>official</em> to go with a Steam Console. <em>That <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller 2 leak</a> looked pretty good to me.</em></p>
<p>Really though, I do think this <em>is</em> Valve's ultimate goal. Getting Steam everywhere they can having their own entire full ecosystem that you're hooked into.</p>
<p>A big question though: would such a machine even sell enough to make it actually worth it? Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony are all pretty well entrenched in the market for this type of device already.</p>
<p>For consumers it <em>would</em> be a good thing though wouldn't it? The same games available across PC, Handheld and the Living Room. Or am I just typing out my own dreams here? Anyway, if Valve don't do it, I'll have to resort to building myself a mini PC with some of these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/amd-reveal-ryzen-9950x3d-and-9900x3d-fire-range-hx3d-for-mobile-ryzen-z2-for-handheld-pcs-rdna-4-and-fsr-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">next-generation AMD CPUs / APUs</a> and the eventual <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS release that's coming soon</a> (or perhaps go with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/even-with-steamos-coming-to-more-systems-bazzite-has-no-plans-to-go-anywhere/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>).</p>

      <title>Hexagod is a minimalist roguelike village builder from the dev of Chess Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Aarimous is getting closer to releasing Hexagod, a minimalist roguelike village builder where you place hexagon tiles, manage resources, find relics, and command your villagers. Made with Godot, this is their second game following the clever Chess Survivors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18361512921738767810gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cute villagers you take care of and place around your village.</li>
<li>Hexagon tile placement with strategic depth.</li>
<li>Unique runs with a variety of random events and procedurally generated game boards.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-21 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
</ul>
<p>They've been posting regularly about game development on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aarimous/videos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, a good watch if you're interested in the business side of being an indie developer. Like their most recent video about time and costs, which includes notes about them working on controller support for Steam Deck too:</p>

      <title>Beholder: Conductor is Papers, Please meets the Golden Idol series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest from Alawar is a spin-off from the previous Beholder games. The first had you be a landlord in a totalitarian country, the second had you work in their central ministry and now this next game has you work as a train conductor.</p>
<p>Aboard a legendary train, the Determination Bringer, you assume you role of senior conductor. The game has you monitor the passengers of the train, uncover conspiracies and attempt to keep everything running smoothly. They said to "Imagine the choice-driven gameplay of Papers Please blended with the mystery of the Golden Idol Series".</p>
<p>Check out the previous teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AS5h3YUhMew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca7cadf4437adac241133559e5d274e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AS5h3YUhMew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the passengers - Carefully monitor everyone who enters the carriage and decide what to do with fare-evaders. Observe and report all suspicious, unauthorized and basically any passenger activity. Search the baggage and call the police if you find prohibited items.</li>
<li>Move up the train - Get access to the dining car or VIP compartments and carriages where high-ranking officials and big industrialists ride. Keep an eye on your colleagues and report their accepting bribes or transporting banned goods. The Ministry will not let your dedication go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Complete secret missions - Earn the trust of higher-ups in order to receive special assignments. Their level of secrecy will depend on your loyalty, and completion will be rewarded with a bonus or even a promotion. You will also encounter smugglers — transporting their packages along the route is risky, but profitable.</li>
<li>Visit various stations and remote corners of the country. Make difficult decisions determining the fate of passengers and your colleagues. What kind of person will you be at the end of the journey? The choice is yours!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's set to have a demo during Steam Next Fest from February 24th. Sounds like it could be a good one.</p>

      <title>Heart of the Machine is deep, fascinating and engrossing to play as a sentient AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Become a sentient AI in Heart of the Machine, the latest deep strategy game from Arcen Games (AI War 1/2, The Last Federation, Bionic Dues) and it's now in Early Access. I've been running it on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> and it's been running very nicely. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>What exactly is it? A game that unusually blends many different genres together. Mostly fits in within the strategy genre but there's a blend of RPG mechanics, city-building and more with a lot of options and progression systems that make it one of the most unique experiences you can find right now. Everything depends on the decisions you make, what goals you're trying to achieve and it's just thoroughly different.</p>
<p>Even the setup here before you get into the game had me raising eyebrows with a little excitement, with the background lore and how it mentions that the city itself is both your enemy and your canvas. With the rise of all this AI <em>nonsense</em> in the real world, it really feels like a fitting what-if experience.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mxhu_ilHB50"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9bdbf3d9df4538b1731b8467c22b2483.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mxhu_ilHB50" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's quite a complicated game to get into but thankfully there's a little Prologue to get you going that will teach you the basics. Not a whole lot though mind you and the game pretty rapidly spreads in more and more features that it can be quite easy to get a bit overwhelmed by it.</p>
<p>The game really asks: what kind of AI will you be? And even from the get-go, you know it's going to be good when it gives you multiple options on how to proceed after your awakening and some of those come with multiple possible outcomes. I went a murderous route which, uh — didn't exactly go particularly well. Good job I'm an AI and can just keep spreading myself around to various Androids.</p>
<p>This is not a real-time game but turn-based, so you get plenty of time to weigh up all your options, which you'll be doing constantly as you try to get a feel for what you want to do. And reading, lots and lots of tooltip reading. There's so much information it will make your head spin.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that much like when Stellaris first came on the scene, Heart of the Machine is going to take over my life while I try various different things and attempt to mess with the city and find out all the mysteries. Can't wait to see this continue to expand during Early Access (which they said should be around 12 months long). This is a real love-letter to science fiction and I couldn't be more pleased.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7602386321738762312gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Don't let the Early Access tag fool you though, this is already packed full of content, they just plan to continue to add a whole lot more possibilities as time goes on.</p>

      <title>Valve now warns on Steam pages if an Early Access game hasn&#39;t been updated in a long time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Early Access can be an incredible thing to allow developers to build up their game with the community, and pull in some early funds, it can also go very wrong. And now Valve are making it a bit clearer for you if a game hasn't been updated.</p>
<p>As spotted by SteamDB on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, in the big Early Access box on a Steam store page that sits at the top just below screenshots and videos, it will now have some highlighted text to note if there's been a long period since the last update.</p>
<p>Scanning over Steam today here's an example to show from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2594870/Lethal_Beach/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Lethal Beach</a>, that released into Early Access in January 2024 and hasn't had an update for 12 months.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6899315051738757359gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve do something about games that are just languishing on the store, seemingly doing nothing, but still may have people buying into them. Currently it seems like this notice might appear once the last update was at least 12 months ago from looking over various Early Access games.</p>
<p>This follows on from other Steam store updates like games now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat</a>. Valve made a few other nice tweaks last year too like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dealing with publisher spam on store pages</a>.</p>

      <title>You can now GoPro with your Steam Deck and mount it to your belly - or wherever you want</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechanism, who made the excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/set-comfort-level-to-maximum-with-the-mechanism-gaming-pillow-for-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gaming Pillow</a>, said about their latest accessory kit the GoPro Mount that "No one asked for this…" but they did it anyway, because why not it actually sounds pretty useful.</p>
<p>They said "Just in case you need more validation in your gaming career: now you can finally say you've gone pro. Designed for static loads only (don't go skydiving with your console please)". Mechanism of course included some slightly silly uses in their marketing for their new GoPro Mount, which slots into their existing Mechanism mounting point, like with their Deckmate. One such example is strapping it to your belly for when you're relaxing with a game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12809783341738754795gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Picture credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>I'm not one to judge because…that actually doesn't look too bad. Still, I think I would prefer their Gaming Pillow in that situation which really does work nicely with the Steam Deck. Having it attached directly to me would feel a bit — weird. Maybe some GamingOnLinux readers will find it useful though.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, better still, when you're on the throne so you don't miss a moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/192542171738755010gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Picture credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>I'm definitely going to judge you if you do that though.</p>
<p>There's plenty of actual genuine uses for this, since GoPro have a lot of accessories and stands.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9394358011738755077gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Picture credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>At £8 that seems nice and reasonable for a specialised mount and screw. Although, you do then need to buy their grips to go with it.</p>

      <title>Flathub adds We Love Games and On the go sections plus details on what&#39;s next for their infrastructure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> is carefully tweaking and expanding their Linux software store, with two newer flashy sections included on it. Plus, some details behind the scenes on what they're working on.</p>
<p>What is Flathub? A way to install various apps and games across many different Linux distributions, and it's the default way to install new apps on Valve's Steam Deck in Desktop Mode via the Discover app.</p>
<p>Since gaming on Linux (hi!) is a bigger thing now, they're attempting to give it a bit of a boost on the Flathub store directly. This comes with the new "We ♥ Games" section that you can find if you scroll down a bit. Writing on Mastodon, developer "razze" <a href="https://mastodon.social/@razze@osna.social/113936280873590097" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've added a new card to the landing page of flathub.org yesterday, focused on games. We have been trying to do this for quiet some time and I know that the results (as in what is in which category) are not perfect, but putting this out there hopefully helps us move things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17547786751738751913gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, the official Flathub account on Mastodon, also <a href="https://mastodon.social/@flathub@floss.social/113948318239881567" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the new On the go section. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a shiny new “On the Go” section on Flathub! ✨📱✨ Check out how we’re making it easier to find Linux apps for mobile devices like phones, tablets, and even Steam Decks using existing data and open standards. And developers: if your app is ready for mobile but isn’t featured in the new section, learn how to fix it. ⚒️</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16086364291738752014gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's more too. In a fresh blog post titled "<a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/flathub-build-infrastructure-revamp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">What's next for Flathub build infrastructure</a>" developer Bart Piotrowski noted how there's "a storm coming and we are re-architecting our build infrastructure". Sounds pretty complicated, especially with their sponsor Equinix Metal pulling out which is affecting various open source projects as Equinix Metal is being sunset. At least for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/2011" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FreeDesktop.org</a>, AWS and Cloudflare have noted potential sponsorships, so perhaps Flathub can get in on that too.</p>

      <title>Epic Games devs talk about solutions to the Unreal Engine stuttering issues in games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you've played a game using Unreal Engine, or for that matter any modern game engine, you've likely encountered various forms of stuttering. One major issue is shader stuttering, as games build up that cache and it seems Epic Games have a solution for Unreal Engine.</p>
<p><em>We might finally see games eventually perform a lot better on PC. </em></p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/game-engines-and-shader-stuttering-unreal-engines-solution-to-the-problem" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> is highly technical but it's good to see Epic developers are working on solutions, and giving advice to developers on some best practices. In super-simple basic terms: when developers make games, the shaders used to render 3D images are written in a language that needs to be changed so your GPU can actually run it.</p>
<p><em>"Shader compilation stuttering happens when a render engine discovers that it needs to compile a new shader right before it uses it for drawing something, so everything stops while waiting for the driver to finish compilation." - Epic Games</em></p>
<p>The issue, as Epic say, is that going way back games didn't have as many shaders, and so this code translation wasn't much of an issue when running a game. But, games have grown a lot bigger and more complex resulting in all the stuttering.</p>
<p><em>"Rendering an object usually involves several shaders (e.g. a vertex shader and a pixel shader working together), as well as a number of other settings for the GPU: culling mode, blend mode, depth and stencil comparison modes etc. Together, these items describe the configuration, or state, of the GPU pipeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Older graphics APIs like Direct3D 11 and OpenGL allow for changing parts of the state individually and at arbitrary times, which means that the driver only sees the complete configuration when the game issues a draw request. Some settings influence the executable shader code, so there are cases when the driver can only start compiling shaders when the draw command is processed. This can take tens of milliseconds or more for a single draw command, resulting in very long frames when a shader is used for the first time—a phenomenon known to most gamers as hitching or stuttering.</em></p>
<p><em>Modern APIs require developers to package all the shaders and settings they will use for a draw request into a Pipeline State Object and set it as a single unit. Crucially, PSOs can be constructed at any time, so in theory engines can create everything they need sufficiently early (for example during loading), so that compilation has time to finish before rendering." - Epic Games</em></p>
<p>Making use of modern graphics APIs like Direct3D 12 and Vulkan with Pipeline State Objects (PSOs) is part of the solution. They even talk up Vulkan's Graphics Pipeline Library as a "good initiative". However, prior to Unreal Engine 5.2, they were suggesting developers run "automated level fly-throughs, and other such discovery methods" (like playing the game through) to build up a cache of the PSOs to bundle with the game (in a way, similar to Valve's shader precache system on Steam). The problem is, as they say, it has many limitations like being "resource-intensive and it must be kept up to date when content changes".</p>
<p>With Unreal Engine 5.2 they introduced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/pso-precaching-for-unreal-engine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PSO precaching</a> system, to enable developers to do a fair amount of this at game loading time. With GPU drivers saving these PSOs, they can be re-loaded and reduce loading time on subsequent game sessions and result in a smoother gameplay experience. This precache system is <em>not</em> finished though and still seeing lots of improvements:</p>
<p><em>"The precaching system has evolved a lot since its experimental introduction in 5.2 and it prevents most kinds of shader compilation stutters. However, it still has some coverage gaps and other limitations, so there are ongoing efforts to improve it further. We’re also working with hardware and software vendors to adapt drivers and graphics APIs to the way games use these systems in practice." - Epic Games</em></p>
<p>Epic ends the post with a few bits of useful advice for game developers on ensuring a smoother experience.</p>

      <title>Get ready for a smashing time as Wreckfest 2 comes to Early Access in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bugbear and THQ Nordic have announced that the chaotic racer Wreckfest 2 is set for an Early Access release on March 20th. The first game is great fun and it's Steam Deck Verified, hopefully the sequel will run well with Proton too.</p>
<p>You're in for a smashing time on this one, as it's full-contact racing. No shiny super cars, just lots of dented vehicles with crazy drivers. As they said: "As Early Access progresses, you'll be able to build the banger of your dreams and transform your battered ride into a wrecking machine! New cars and other vehicles will be added as the game evolves". A much less serious game compared to a lot of other racers and I'm all for it. This is the type of game where you can really just blow off some steam.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z2PCl64qnng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/671c9aa5735c4530952595198c95e3e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z2PCl64qnng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unmatched racing experience - </strong>Brace yourself for the most phenomenal full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw dropping moments of chaos and destruction, powered by the overhauled physics engine. Race in intense head-to-head fights on courses featuring high-speed circuits, crazy courses with obstacles &amp; jumps, intersections and oncoming traffic, or go for demolition domination in derby mode.<br/>
<em>- More and more tracks &amp; arenas will be added during the Early Access phase -</em></li>
<li><strong>Awesome &amp; customizable cars - </strong>Forget pristine supercars: Our cars are old, dented and patched together. Each of them tells a story, and you can tell your own by customizing your ride. Over the course of early access, more and more customization options will be added to the game. They will not only unlock your creative desires, but also contain new armor and component types that support certain playstyles.<br/>
<em>- Later during Early Access, you can also share your designs with other racers and wreckers! -</em></li>
<li><strong>Fully revamped game modes - </strong>Launching into early access with the base game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer mode. During the Early Access phase, we will add a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle and guides you on your journey to become a true champion! For online racers there will be new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues coming as well!</li>
<li><strong>Challenges - </strong>Another highlight during the Early Access phase will be special challenges, putting you behind the steering wheel of unconventional vehicles that were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack! Various bite-sized scenarios will keep you hooked as you battle for the highest scores.</li>
<li><strong>Tournaments - </strong>Players can also look forward to tournaments that will be implemented during the Early Access phase. Here you can earn unique rewards in special events - events which test more than just your driving skills!</li>
<li><strong>Mod Support - </strong>During the Early Access phase, mod support will be added so you can really mess with this game by installing various mods from the Steam Workshop.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Atari announced Breakout Beyond, a fresh spin on the classic from the devs of BIT.TRIP</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Breakout franchise is making a full return, with Atari announcing Breakout Beyond, developed by Choice Provisions (the studio behind BIT.TRIP). Not quite the classic you remember. They're saying it's a reimagining of the series that invites players to break on through to the other side.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this neon-infused twist on the classic 1976 arcade game, players smash through each puzzle by clearing bricks to reach the final goal. However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in Breakout."</p>

<p>From the press release sent today: it was originally slated as an Amico Intellivision exclusive back in 2020, Atari agreed to acquire and complete the development of the title. “We’re thrilled to be able to bring this gem to our players,” said Ethan Stearns, Senior Director of Games Publishing at Atari. “The team thought it was a brilliant concept, preserving the heart of Breakout’s gameplay while also giving the formula a completely new spin. Breakout Beyond is a worthy new entry into the Breakout pantheon, and we can’t wait to see the insane combos brick-breakers will make.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard.</li>
<li>72 challenging levels that will put players’ brick-breaking skills to the test.</li>
<li>Two-player co-op to manage (or ramp up) the chaos with a friend.</li>
<li>Procedural audio and visual effects that increase in intensity with each combo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like you'll need Proton to run it on Linux.</p>

      <title>The latest Valve Steam Console rumour with AMD RDNA4 can be safely ignored - here&#39;s why</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 05/02/25 09:12am UTC</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais quoted this very article on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lhflptgruk2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> to note "Thank you... we've done pre-release Mesa Vulkan work on every AMD architecture since Vega thanks to them kindly providing hardware, so there's nothing meaningful to read into there."</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original (and clearly correct) article below:</em></p>
<p>Thanks to posts on social media and YouTuber videos, which now other news sites have picked up, we're seeing fresh rumours about a new Steam Machine / Steam Console.</p>
<p>A lot of it seems to have come from <a href="https://x.com/HandleDeck/status/1886724649750302816" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@HandleDeck</a> on X, in a post where they suggest and speculate on future Valve hardware that was then picked up in a video from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f3D79aoro8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">eXtas1s</a>" on YouTube, and now multiple bigger news websites have decided to run with it.</p>
<p>What's the story here: Valve developer Samuel Pitoiset added a update in the documentation for the open source Mesa graphics drivers recently to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/33281/diffs?commit_id=b3cff84e0607f1ecf433fe51f65d4dc725054ce9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">note</a> AMD RDNA4 support "should be good enough", just part of the release notes for an upcoming Mesa release, which was shared by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-25.0-RADV-RDNA4-State" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>. For people who don't regularly follow Linux, this seems to have caused their brains to wildly speculate on new Valve hardware coming, and it's now being spun into a rumour of Valve competing with Microsoft and Sony for the console space.</p>
<p><em>You could run this rumour any time a Valve contracted developer updates Mesa for newer AMD hardware.</em></p>
<p>Here's why I believe the rumours are plain and simply incorrect: Valve have paid developers to work on the AMD Mesa drivers for <em>years</em> at this point, to improve Linux as a whole and ensure Linux drivers are in a good state for upcoming and future AMD hardware. Valve invest in a lot of different areas for Linux, not all of it specifically just for their own hardware. A lot of their contracted developers just work on regular upgrades and improvements like this. Valve have done this for a long time now that we've been covering here.</p>
<p>This isn't to say Valve definitely aren't working on future hardware, they're always seemingly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-may-be-working-on-a-new-kind-of-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">working on <em>something</em></a>, just that <u><em>this specific new rumour</em></u> is wrong based on where they're getting their information from — a small documentation update for upcoming Mesa driver upgrades (that traditional desktop Linux uses, as well as Valve's SteamOS).</p>
<p>A fair amount of previous rumours ended up being for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's wider SteamOS push on more devices</a>. This Mesa update helps with the SteamOS push too, so you could <em>eventually</em> run SteamOS on any of your own AMD RDNA4 devices. Again, it's not specific to Valve hardware.</p>
<p>Valve already have their hands full with all this, and it's a lot of work to add in another system, so they're clearly not yet ready for it. They've already said the hardware for a Steam Deck 2 simply isn't there yet for a generational leap, so it won't be that either. <em>Just don't expect a new home console from Valve any time soon.</em></p>
<p>I fully expect the next hardware to come from Valve will be a new VR headset to replace the ageing Valve Index.</p>

      <title>UK gov responds to the newer Stop Killing Games petition - no plans to amend UK consumer law</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second Stop Killing Games petition in the UK crossed over 10,000 signatures, and so the government have responded with a full statement.</p>
<p>As a reminder: this is the initiative started up by YouTuber Ross Scott / of Accursed Farms, resulting from Ubisoft shutting down The Crew and preventing people who purchased it from playing it. The first UK petition had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/uk-government-replies-to-petition-about-requiring-publishers-to-keep-games-working/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">government response last year</a>, which really just reiterated the current consumer laws.</p>
<p>This second petition also now has a reply from the UK government and it's clear they have zero plans to change anything right now. Here's their reply in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government recognises concerns raised by video games users regarding the operability of purchased products. As the lead department for video games, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) regularly engages industry representatives and monitors how consumers interact with games. We work with the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) as the lead department for consumer protection more generally.</p>
<p>We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued. We have no plans to amend existing consumer law on digital obsolescence, but we will monitor this issue and consider the relevant work of the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) on consumer rights and consumer detriment.</p>
<p>Video games sellers must comply with existing consumer law – this includes the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs). We have provided details of relevant protections below. However, there is no requirement in UK law for software companies to support older versions of their products. Decision-making is for those companies, taking account of commercial and regulatory factors and complying with existing consumer law. There may be occasions where companies make decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for games with declining user bases.</p>
<p>The CRA gives consumers important rights when they make a contract with a trader for the supply of digital content, requiring it to be of satisfactory quality, fit for a particular purpose and as described by the seller. It may be difficult and expensive for businesses to maintain support for old software, particularly if it needs to interact with new technologies. However, if software is offered for sale that is not supported by the provider, then this should be made clear, for example on product webpages and physical packaging.</p>
<p>If digital content does not meet these quality rights, the consumer is entitled to a repair or replacement or, if not possible, some money back up to 100% of the cost of the digital content. These rights apply to intangible digital content like a PC game, as well as tangible content like a physical copy of a game. The CRA has a limit of up to six years after a breach of contract during which a consumer can take legal action.</p>
<p>A trader or third party can upgrade and improve the features of digital content so long as it continues to match any description given by the trader and conforms with any pre-contract information provided by the trader, unless varied by express agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, the CRA requires that the terms and conditions applied by a trader to a product they sell must not be unfair and must be prominent and transparent. If not, they may also be challenged and the question of fairness is a matter for the courts. Terms found to be unfair are not binding on the consumer.</p>
<p>The CPRs require information to consumers to be clear and correct and prohibit commercial practices which through false information or misleading omissions cause the average consumer to make a different choice. As such, the regulations prohibit commercial practices which omit or hide information which the average consumer needs to make an informed choice, and prohibits traders from providing material information in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner. If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPRs may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances.</p>
<p>The CPRs are enforced by Trading Standards and the CMA. If consumers believe that there has been a breach of these regulations, they should report it to the Citizens Advice helpline (or Advice Direct Scotland for those living in Scotland) which is a free service advising on rights and how to take their case forward. The helplines will refer complaints to Trading Standards and CMA where appropriate. Consumers can also pursue private redress through the courts where a trader has provided misleading information on a product.<br/>
<br/>
The CPRs section of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Act 2024 is expected to come into effect in April 2025. It restates and updates the CPRs into primary legislation, revokes the 2008 regulations and sets out rules around unfair trading. The Act:<br/>
● Provides the Secretary of State with the power to add, amend, or remove a description of a commercial practice which are in all circumstances considered unfair<br/>
● Provides clarification that someone facilitating supply or promotion of a product is a ‘trader’ and must comply with consumer law</p>
<p>The use of this power will be kept under review – any amendments proposed are subject to a duty to consult with stakeholders and approval by both Houses of Parliament.<br/>
Department for Culture, Media and Sport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, these types of petitions aren't going to really help anything right now.</p>
<p>For now, your best bet is to be on the lookout for games that force an online connection and look to a different game. What we can perhaps hope for instead though, is to have stores like Steam require developers to clearly state on store pages if there's a forced online requirement, much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they now require for for kernel-level anti-cheat</a>. Valve also made a tweak on Steam to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-purchases-now-clearly-state-youre-just-getting-a-license-not-ownership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more clearly note you're buying a license</a> last year too, you don't actually own what you buy.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes up The Finals and No Man&#39;s Sky VR with Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Proton Experimental update from Valve has landed fixing up issues with two games for Linux / Steam Deck so here's what's new. This follows on from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/proton-hotfix-updated-to-get-the-finals-working-again-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Proton Hotfix</a> for The Finals. Confused yet? See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in my guide on all the Proton versions</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The two fixes Valve noted are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed The Finals crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed No Man's Sky failing to boot in VR mode after a recent game update.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1753916821738664133gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - THE FINALS on Linux</em></p>
<p>It will just show up in your Steam Downloads as an update for Proton Experimental. The Finals is already set for Proton Experimental by default, but you'll need to swap it over for No Man's Sky VR in settings -&gt; compatibility. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in our guide on changing Proton versions</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app makes improvements to Collections, fixes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Script Extender on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app has another update out, this time with more UI changes and improvements to the Collections system along with bug fixes. Still in Alpha, with a limited selection of supported games, but they're working on supporting more games.</p>
<p>For the Collections feature it will now sit at the top if you have some installed, along with being read-only when you first add them to ensure "you get the full experience the curator intended". Downloading and installing mod collections was also improved, along with a UI change to show you when a collection has been updated. They also said "mod updates are coming soon".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9802176141738593915gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>All the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Workspace Improvements</strong></p>
<p>We've made several improvements to the behaviour of the left menu in your Workspaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left menu has been reorganised with the Library at the top, the mods in your loadout in the middle, and the extra utilities at the bottom.</li>
<li>Pages in the left menu will now show active/selected states based on which panels/tabs are open and in view.</li>
<li>Tooltips have been added to the left menu items so you can always see the full name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mod Thumbnails</strong></p>
<p>We've added the mod page image as a thumbnail in the Library, My Mods, and Collection Download pages. It's a small change, but we think it makes a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new error pop-up when the app encounters an unexpected error. This can be turned off in the Settings.</li>
<li>Added CLI commands to allows users to delete files from the hidden Override folder where this has compromised their setup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Health Checks not refreshing properly when the Loadout changes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when installing Baldur's Gate 3 Script Extender on Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, a Command Prompt window will appear behind the app while it is running.</li>
<li>When viewing a read-only collection, it is still possible to toggle individual mods on and off, but this does not affect your loadout.</li>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections does not show the correct value.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The "Switch View" option does not persist in the Library/Installed Mods view.</li>
<li>The "Load Order" heading toggle does not persist in the Load Order view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm really looking forward to Nexus adding the likes of Skyrim and Fallout into this one, it's what many keep asking for. Their <a href="https://trello.com/b/gPzMuIr3/nexus-mods-app-roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> clearly shows Bethesda games are planned, so it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.7.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Run a game store and go through gaming history in GSC - Game Store Chronicle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Imponix Game Studio have announced GSC - Game Store Chronicle, a management simulator where you run your very own game store.</p>
<p>They say it's "not just another simulator" like we've seen quite a lot of pop up recently including Supermarket Simulator, TCG Card Shop Simulator, Grocery Store Simulator, Clothing Store Simulator and various others, as it "features a timeline tied to gaming industry history, letting you follow the greatest consoles, games, and moments through the generations".</p>
<p>The first trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="foXS-oSy1H8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/75fef4918997e0a82ef12809e2720785.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/foXS-oSy1H8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the very first console launches to the dawn of iconic gaming eras, your store will grow alongside the industry. Organize shelves, create attractive displays, and ensure your shop is the go-to destination for gaming enthusiasts. Make every decision count—your store layout and product selection are key to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every decision you make shapes your business—from product selection to pricing strategies. Will you build a thriving store that becomes a gaming hub, or will you fall behind as trends shift and evolve? The choice is yours in this vibrant simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer confirmed Linux / Steam Deck support on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imponix.com/post/3lh2swsioas2o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course it will have! Steamdeck and Linux, in fact, this one I'll do better testing on desktop Linux. VoS I did test directly on Steamdeck, but not on desktop linux, just through players feedbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due out sometime in Q3 2025.</p>

<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH has its first post-release patch to improve how it runs across all systems, with some useful improvements.</p>
<p>Version 1.001 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall game stability, including several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed the graphics preset to be set to 'Low' when launching for the first time on Steam Deck, even when save data is linked from the cloud. (The next time the game is launched on Steam Deck, the saved settings will be applied.)</li>
<li>When playing on a PC that supports NVIDIA DLSS, the default setting for 'Anti-Aliasing Method' is now set to 'DLSS'.</li>
<li>The DirectStorage DLL (Dynamic Link Library) has been updated to the latest version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8490529261738580976gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For some reason certain developers keep syncing up graphics settings to the Steam Cloud. Something that really <em>shouldn't</em> be done, as it can cause all sorts of problems when playing across different systems. In this case, moving between a PC and Steam Deck caused the Steam Deck to try and run the much higher settings. Hopefully this will no longer happen now, and hopefully in future developers will just stop doing that entirely.</p>
<p>If you missed it: Valve recently updated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-work-better-on-linux-steam-deck-with-the-latest-proton-hotfix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Hotfix to make it run smoother on Linux / Steam Deck</a>.</p>

      <title>1997 classic adventure The Space Bar upgraded with ScummVM and Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic revived. The ZOOM Platform recently announced that the 1997 classic adventure The Space Bar has been upgraded to use ScummVM and there's now a Linux version to go with it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the announcement the ZOOM Platform said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first released The Space Bar, the engine source code was considered lost. However, in early 2024, the Boffo Intergalactic Games team was able to locate it. We shared the source code with the team at ScummVM to ensure this classic adventure game was preserved. The Space Bar can now be enjoyed on any ScummVM supported system. Using ScummVM, we've updated the game on <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/the-space-bar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2253580/The_Space_Bar/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. You can now run the game natively on Windows, Linux and MacOS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More about the game: "A shapeshifting assassin is loose on the planet Armpit VI, and all signs of its whereabouts point to a local space bar, 'The Thirsty Tentacle'. You are the only human on this bizarre planet, who happens to be a telepathic detective tasked with tracking down this dangerous criminal."</p>

      <title>PS2 Emulator emulator PCSX2 should get Wayland support &#34;in the coming months&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PCSX2 is a free and open source Sony PS2 Emulator, and it seems they're working towards ensuring it has full support for Wayland on Linux.</p>
<p>Back with the 2.0 release in July 2024, the developers switched over from wxWidgets to a much more modern Qt for the interface. And now, they're looking to upgrade again to Qt 6.9 which should arrive in March, and bring with it support for the modern Wayland protocol on Linux.</p>
<p>As they announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pcsx2.bsky.social/post/3lh247gkfvc2q" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@PCSX2/113923210493503370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few of the project members are looking at Qt 6.9 as a way to finally get #Wayland working with PCSX2 on #Linux. We're going to keep testing, but we haven't found any problems so far. Qt 6.9's final release is on 18 March. We hope to see Wayland support in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While technically it has Wayland support, in a way, it was <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/10179" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previously</a> disabled by default due to lots of issues.</p>
<p>Going by their current compatibility page there's now 97.92% of the PS2 library at least playable, with only 0.22% noting they can only get just into the menus so it's looking great.</p>

      <title>Video Game History Foundation launches a digital archive free for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving everyone free access to their new launch (well, it's in "early access"), the Video Game History Foundation have put up their digital archive of video game history research materials.</p>
<p>This was originally announced <a href="https://gamehistory.org/introducing-the-vghf-digital-library/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in late 2023</a>, the idea is to give you an easy way to access various historic collections of video game development materials, magazines, artwork, ephemera and more. There's already a huge amount of resources available in it (they say there's over "1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines—including game industry trade magazines rarely available to the public") which includes some never-before-seen game development materials.</p>
<p>Check out their announcement video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6Tysm_Wf60Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbf45e9b0f1b9007a3538b514253ebf8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6Tysm_Wf60Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To make it all actually work they even built a new "state-of-the-art text recognition toolset that makes even the wildest, weirdest video game magazines and promotional materials fully text-searchable". This is a wonderful initiative to ensure gaming history of all forms is not lost. Love seeing more preservation efforts like this.</p>

      <title>Physics building game Besiege gets a big 10 year anniversary update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Besiege from Spiderling Studios just had a big free upgrade for all players to celebrate the 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>More about it: Besiege is a physics building game about constructing mechanical machines to annihilate armies, obliterate castles and overcome challenging obstacles. Conquer the campaign or skirmish with friends in Multiplayer!</p>
<p>They put up a new showcase video for the event you can see below, and they said to expect other events throughout the year. A roadmap for 2025 and beyond updates is also going to be announced, as it seems they're going to continue expanding the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7Yk_dBLvH0g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e5786590427c7f5aad10d265f73206c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7Yk_dBLvH0g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Update Highlights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Trading Cards, Emotes, Backgrounds, and Badges: Celebrate the Besiege journey with collectible Steam trading cards, custom emotes, backgrounds, and unique badges to showcase on your profile.</li>
<li>The Remaster of the Original Sandbox: Revisit the beloved sandbox that launched Besiege’s legacy, allowing players to relive the charm of the game’s early days while building and experimenting in a remaster of the classic environment.</li>
<li>Scoreboard System: Compete against yourself and Besiege’s other players with a brand-new scoreboard system for tracking stats and ranking the performance of your builds. From speed records to destruction efficiency, the scoreboard adds a competitive layer to the fun and the motivation to challenge yourself and refine your machines.</li>
<li>New Achievements and Campaign Content: Unlock brand-new achievements that push the boundaries of your creativity and skill and enjoy refreshing new content in some of the campaign’s classic levels.</li>
<li>Rulers in Campaign Levels: The rulers of each campaign island now exist in game, fighting alongside their armies in defence of their kingdoms. Each ruler has a unique style that brings a new layer of personality to your campaign conquests.</li>
<li>Original 2015 Early Access Version: Take a nostalgic trip to the past with access to the original 2015 Early Access version via Steam’s beta system. Relive the game’s humble beginnings and see how far it’s come.</li>
<li>Automatic Timescale Adjustment: This new innovative feature provides a smoother player experience by automatically adjusting the timescale slider, enabling slow motion during hardware-intensive moments and complex physics simulations. Say goodbye to frame rate drops and enjoy the added bonus of watching Besiege’s beautiful, chaotic, destruction in slow motion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"This update is more than a celebration of our game's history, it’s a thank-you to the community that has supported us for the past decade," said Spiderling Studios. "We’re proud to commemorate Besiege’s legacy with content &amp; features that blend nostalgia with innovation, enhancing the existing campaign and providing new challenges for players."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The rumours were true, EA have re-released the classics. The Sims Legacy Collection and The Sims 2 Legacy Collection are live on Steam now. Both include a bunch of previously released DLC for each game.</p>
<p>Of course, since it's EA, you also have to deal with: "EA online activation and EA app software installation and background use required" and also Denuvo Anti-tamper. Should still work fine on Linux with Valve's Proton though, apart from the occasional EA app blip. Valve rated The Sims 1 as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable, currently no rating on The Sims 2.<br/>
<em><strong>Update: 19:54 UTC</strong> - EA have removed the mention of the EA app and Denuvo on both.</em></p>
<p>The Sims Legacy Collection includes: The Sims, The Sims 4 Throwback Fit Kit. Plus The Sims packs: The Sims Livin’ Large, , The Sims House Party, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar and The Sims Makin’ Magic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346728411738340014gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Sims</em></p>
<p>The Sims 2: Legacy Collection includes The Sims 2 and The Sims 4: Grunge Revival Kit, plus the following The Sims 2 packs: The Sims 2: University, The Sims 2: Nightlife, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration!

      <title>Warner Bros platform fighter MultiVersus goes offline for good in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Player First Games / Warner Bros. Games have announced that the Super Smash Bros.-like game MultiVersus is officially closing.</p>
<p>Technically, this is the second time it's being closed. It originally launched in 2022 in what they called a Beta, which they then closed in 2023, with a proper relaunch in May 2024. This time though it seems it's not going to be coming back, as they're pulling all online features and you will not be able to download it either (unless you already have it added to your library - it's a free to play game).</p>
<p>In a short and blunt <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818750/view/509570438492325577" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they said:</p>

<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> it doesn't have all that many players left. It's seen a steady decline after each time it was released and then re-released. While talking player numbers isn't always a useful thing, in this case it's a multiplayer-focused title so it seems fitting when you see that it had a 24 hour peak online player-count of only 648 players. Which would be mostly fine for a smaller game, but this was a game with major licensed characters.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> last year, taken from a financial call, "MultiVersus' failure had added another $100 million to the $200 million writedown the company's games business had already suffered earlier this year". Seems they had some seriously inflated expectations for this one.</p>
<p>At least for people who like it you'll still be able to play offline. MultiVersus works on Linux with Proton and is rated Playable on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Linux performance overlay MangoHud 0.8.0-rc1 out now for testing with Intel GPU support and lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is a performance overlay you can use on Desktop Linux, and it's what powers the built-in overlay on Steam Deck. A new release candidate is now available for testing for an upcoming stable release with version 0.8.0-rc1.</p>
<p>This release adds a few more applications to the blacklist to stop it appearing and causing issues with them including the Ubisoft Store (UplayWebCore.exe), halloy (IRC client) and Plutonium Launcher (plutonium.exe, plutonium-launcher-win32.exe).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7912058801738327495gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7912058801738327495gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stalker 2 on Linux with MangoHud, click image to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>If you like my simple horizontal layout you can find it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Just pop it into "~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf".</p>
<p>Also some fixes made it in including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">read_cfg</code> didn't properly overwrite config options.</li>
<li>logging would sometimes crash if it returned an empty vec.</li>
<li>fix double-logging of avg fps.</li>
<li>nvidia: warn if both nvml and xnvctrl are unavailable.</li>
<li>mangoapp didn't properly respond to hide/show hud.</li>
<li>add 32bit xkbcommon to project dependencies.</li>
<li>add missing dependencies for opensuse.</li>
<li>proper vsync implementation.</li>
<li>refactor FPS calculation in metrics.</li>
<li>fix exec, network, gpu and vram displaying incorrectly in horizontal mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Various other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple GPUs can be displayed</li>
<li>Changed logger errors to debug</li>
<li>Added CPU power to logging</li>
<li>Improved wayland keybinds</li>
<li>Memory usage has been refactored to be inline with other apps</li>
<li>DLSYM is enabled by default, <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_DLSYM=0</code> to disable it.</li>
<li>mangoapp vulkan layer is deleted (it was a testing project and no longer in development)</li>
<li>OpenGL shim
	<ul>
<li>The shim is preloaded first instead of the opengl library</li>
<li>it checks to make sure there is an opengl context to hook before loading mangohud</li>
<li>this should resolve some crashes. More detailed information here <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/c22ced01083fd32476b0bdd8b969ee749631469a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">c22ced0</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using exec and inside steam runtime, launch command using <code class="inline-code">steam-runtime-launch-client</code>
<ul>
<li>If mangohud is used inside flatpak, you need to allow your app to speak on <code class="inline-code">org.freedesktop.Flatpak</code> dbus address.</li>
<li>Example if you're using mangohud in steam: <code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Intel GPUs support (integrated and discrete, i915 and xe drivers)
	<ul>
<li>Temperature is only available in linux 6.13+</li>
<li>Temperature and Power Usage is not available for integrated gpus</li>
<li>VRAM and GPU Usage is per-process not per-system (that would require root rights)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple GPUs support:
	<ul>
<li>By default, MangoHud displays all GPUs. To select needed GPUs, you can use <code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> or <code class="inline-code">pci_dev</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Params</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">network_color</code> sets the color of the network hud element</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">display_server</code> shows if the display server is Xorg, Xwayland or wayland</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> set the GPUs to display in the hud e.g gpu_list=0,1</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">proc_mem</code> and <code class="inline-code">io_read</code> now works properly in gamescope (mangoapp)</li>
</ul>
