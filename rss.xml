      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p><em>If you're confused on the different Proton versions be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide</a>.</em></p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Valve also did a small bump to the Proton 10 Beta (version 10.0-1c) that included some extra fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where generated <code class="inline-code">libraryfolders.vdf</code> file had garbage memory written to it breaking software relying on it, e.g. mod launchers.</li>
<li>Restored behavior that does best-effort Proton prefix upgrades when a unknown prefix version is detected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How to get it</strong></p>
<p>All you have to do is ensure you've got Proton Experimental installed by searching for it directly in your Steam Library. Then you can (if you need to) <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">swap over the Proton version</a> on a game by game basis. Valve will automatically pick what's best when games go through Deck Verified (which also applies to Desktop Linux).</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the most played Steam Deck games for April 2025, Balatro still top but Oblivion Remastered sneaks in second</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new month is here, and something I haven't done recently is a look over what's been the most popular on Steam Deck. So here's what you've all been playing the most over the last month.</p>
<p>Most of the games here aren't exactly surprising, with a lot of them remaining in the top most played lists for months. <strong>Oblivion Remastered</strong> is an obvious new entry and not surprising to see people wanting to play it on Steam Deck. Although, the Verified status for Oblivion Remastered has caused many people to once again question how Valve have been testing, with the out of the box experience resulting in poor performance. If you've played it on Deck be sure to give your thoughts in the comments.</p>
<p>For April 2nd - May 1st, these were the 50 most played games on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Cozy mystery game Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping arrives in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping from Happy Broccoli Games is now set for release on May 22nd, and it will come with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The first game in the series, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam so clearly the developer is onto something with this. Hopefully the follow-up is just as good. It's a standalone adventure, so you don't need to have played the first.</p>
<p>More about it: "Duck Detective is back! Get ready to interview suspects, inspect evidence, and deduce the truth in another stand-alone mystery! This campsite might have ghosts, but the real thing haunting Eugene McQuacklin is his failed marriage and bread addiction. Can he escape the shadows of his past? To the annoyance of the Duck Detective, he is joined by a new partner in (solving) crime. Work together to unravel the truth and nibble on the crumbs of justice!"</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A 2-3 hour long cozy mystery game!</li>
<li>A stand-alone sequel to the acclaimed ‘Duck Detective: The Secret Salami!‘</li>
<li>Interview suspects, fill in the blanks and crack the case!</li>
<li>Fully voice-acted cast of suspiciously secretive characters!</li>
<li>Dive into a murky pond of delinquency and dredge up the truth!</li>
<li>Throw bread to the fine beak of lady justice!</li>

      <title>Borderlands 4 release date now set for September 12, plus a new trailer and deep dive are out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K have announced that the release date for Borderlands 4 has moved up to September 12th and there's a new gameplay trailer to go along with it. Unless they stick in some kernel-level anti-cheat, I would expect this one to work just fine with Valve's Proton on Desktop Linux at least. Remains to be seen if the Steam Deck will be able to handle it.</p>
<p>Here's the new gameplay trailer below, which is from the PlayStation channel, as the one from the official Borderlands channel on YouTube is age-restricted so I can't embed it here. <em>I do hope YouTube one day solve that issue…</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T7miyMigr_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59143e05b2e25a2a1c597f124a500dee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T7miyMigr_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And then the deep-dive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0KlRBwf3sjY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ff489b7a69edceeb866a1ca64cc5fe4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the footage you'll get to see a first-look at two of the new four vault hunter classes. Vex the Siren is a powerful Siren who can empower herself or manifest deadly shades to fight alongside her, while Rafa the Exo-Soldier shines as a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of "digistructing" an arsenal of weapons. The developers say Borderlands 4 has "the most advanced skill tree system in a Borderlands game to-date".</p>
<p>2K said that Borderlands 4 will make it "easier than ever for friends to jump into co-op multiplayer with a new system for players to form parties online and stay together when switching game modes". It will also have "instanced loot for each player, dynamic level scaling, and individual difficulty to keep the party together and having fun through the whole campaign".</p>

      <title>May 25 reminder - GamingOnLinux needs your direct support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome to May 2025 readers! Here's your little reminder that GamingOnLinux is primarily funded by readers - that's you! And as always we need <em>your</em> support.</p>
<p>We're coming up on 16 years in operation this July, which still feels pretty insane to actually write. Hopefully we can continue for another 16 and beyond! Thank you to everyone reading, commenting, sending in tips and leaving comments!</p>
<p><em>Want to help support GamingOnLinux? See below!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, the <em>best</em> way is regular support via<a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Patreon</a>. For Patreon, a <em>suggestion</em> is to pledge around the <em>start</em> of a month, as it charges at the beginning of <em>every</em> month (although that is changing at the end of this year to the date <em>you</em> started each month). Generally the Patreon is just to have <em>regular</em> funding to keep bringing you the news.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All other donations, <em>without</em> any special rewards can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=P85ZZX9W8HFMW" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paypal Donations</a> or Monthly donation/sub suggested levels: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-6MU983833N166101WL3ZRB5I" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter</a> - <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-54T30471MU837021GL3ZRCMY" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter Plus</a></li>

<p>Recently our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a> has expanded to allow you to report a change in status for games, and to submit suggestions to be added to it. The links to each anti-cheat vendor page were also updated to use the vendor name in the URL, instead of our own database ID to make them clearer, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/vendor/BattlEye/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> for example. On top of that, you can even link people to a search on it like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/?search=Call+of+Duty#mainlist" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>, and we're listing games clearly that <em>only</em> work on Steam Deck now too. Hopefully you find this page useful for checking at a glance if an online game that has anti-cheat works or not on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint hits Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam with a big new update live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from Trese Brothers has another huge update out now, and players are enjoying the game so much it's now hit an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it? Imagine a cyberpunk version of XCOM where you build up a team to go on heists. The latest major update to the game added in the Face class tree, expanding the game with another 16 new Talents to manipulate the underworld, contacts, safehouse and team.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new class the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyber Knights is a game about building your rep and connections to get access to richer but riskier opportunities, navigating competing demands from your squad, faction power players, and long-term goals while you keep walking further along the knife-edge of pursuing big scores and keeping your squad able to handle it. Now the Face can give you more control over how you pursue that path. For example, <strong>Co-Conspirator</strong> will let you get missions from specific Contacts you want to work with while <strong>Dealmaker</strong> will let you strengthen ties with specific faction types to increase both your and your Contacts rewards for completing heists.</p>
<p>Your Face is a master of the underworld, deploying talents to manipulate the strategic layer of the game. Their place is at the Safehouse, and unlike other <a href="https://cyberknightswiki.tresebrothers.com/Classes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">character classes</a> in the game, they never join in missions or enter into combat - they hang back, play a mission overwatch role, and work the shadows. Using <strong>Care and Feeding,</strong> your Face can reroll options you don't like from your mercenaries' Limit Breaks and using <strong>Puppetmaster</strong> your Face can push a Contact with an Influence Limit Break to upgrade <em>all</em> of their services in a single go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're getting close to the full launch now, which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/cyber-knights-flashpoint-the-cyberpunk-xcom-like-hits-full-launch-on-may-15/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supposed to come on May 15th</a>, but they recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/643559577714951408" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a> it to June 2nd which I missed, but it's given them time to continue to ensure it's a good one.</p>
<p>See the latest trailer below, just keep in mind the newer release date for June 2nd:</p>

      <title>felix86 is a new open source Linux emulator to run x86-64 Linux programs on RISC-V processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RISC-V fans will be interested in this one. felix86 has been announced as a new project with a first release available that enables you to run x86-64 Linux programs on RISC-V processors on Linux.</p>
<p>Their aim with the project is to get many games working with good performance, and <a href="https://felix86.com/compat/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">some do</a> already fully work but there's still lots of work to do. Some of the games that already work with it include Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment, Baba Is You, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, Don't Starve, World of Goo, Celeste, Balatro, VVVVVV and SuperTuxKart.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>felix86 emulates an x86-64 CPU running in userspace, which is to say it is not a virtual machine like VMware, rather it directly translates the instructions of an application and mostly uses the host Linux kernel to handle syscalls.</p>
<p>Currently, translation happens during execution time, also known as just-in-time (JIT) recompilation. The JIT recompiler in felix86 is focused on fast compilation speed and performs minimal optimizations. It utilizes extensions found on the host system such as the vector extension for SIMD operations, or the <code class="inline-code">B</code> extension for emulating bit manipulation extensions like BMI. The only mandatory extensions for felix86 are <code class="inline-code">G</code>, which every RISC-V general purpose computer should already have, and v1.0 of the standard vector extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty awesome. Love seeing more projects like this across different hardware.</p>

      <title>Evil Dead: The Game gets delisted only 3 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Evil Dead: The Game from Saber Interactive / Boss Team Games, LLC is getting delisted from all stores (Steam purchases are already gone), although you will be able to continue playing it if you wish.</p>
<p>Short a few days from being released for three years, and only two years since the Steam release, this goes to show the complicated situation with licensed games. They already stopped live updates for the game back in September 2023 and cancelled a Nintendo Switch version (<a href="https://x.com/EvilDeadTheGame/status/1704239249761906859" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a>), so the writing was on the wall for this to happen.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts. Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game has Easy Anti-Cheat, although not stated on the Steam page, and going by the latest <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1493750?device=any" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> report it doesn't seem to currently work on Linux.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an active similar game that works on Linux / Steam Deck, I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dead by Daylight</a>. See more games on our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>EA and Codemasters no longer making WRC (World Rally Championship) or any other rally games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA and Codemasters announced today that they're putting the WRC (World Rally Championship) series on hold, and will no longer be making any games in the series. This follows the news that EA's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-cancels-multiple-projects-from-apex-and-titanfall-developer-respawn-with-more-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Respawn cancelled a couple of future projects</a> and let staff go too.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EA website the statement reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Rally Community,</p>
<p>Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announce that we've reached the end of the road working on WRC.</p>
<p>After releasing EA SPORTS WRC in 2023, the 2024 season, including the recently released Hard Chargers Content pack, will be our last expansion.</p>
<p>For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players. We hope it remains a source of joy, excitement, and the thrill of rally racing. We've poured our hearts into making it for fans, and we know you'll keep the passion alive.</p>
<p>Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DiRT. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.</p>
<p>The Codemasters WRC Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shame to see another series get cut.</p>
<p>Although, not that it directly affects Linux Desktop, Steam Deck and SteamOS since EA's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently re-branded EA Javelin Anticheat</a> that was added to EA SPORTS WRC entirely blocks Linux platforms anyway. You can see the status of more games that have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat on our compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app adds Cyberpunk 2077 as a supported game, improves Stardew Valley modding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Great day for modders. The newer in-development open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app has promoted Cyberpunk 2077 to supported status, making it easier to get modding across Linux (and Steam Deck).</p>
<p>The 0.10.2 version release also improves the experience for modding Stardew Valley with mods that don't have a manifest file, and there's also now draggable load order view for Cyberpunk 2077 REDmods.</p>
<p>Currently the only "supported" games out of the box are Stardew Valley and now also Cyberpunk 2077, with other games behind an experimental toggle button. For the newly supported Cyberpunk 2077, Nexus say they're "confident that we've got all the basics in place for players to mod Cyberpunk 2077 with the app".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For Cyberpunk 2077 the app features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with the Steam and GOG Galaxy releases on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Support for the most common types of mod: REDmod, archives, REDscript, and framework mods such (e.g. Cyber Engine Tweaks).</li>
<li>Support for collections</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics for missing dependencies.</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics to help set up a Linux environment to mod the game.</li>
<li>REDmod Load Order management and deployment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7099484331746017193gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some other changes included in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>More Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>When starting the app for the first time, the welcome, data consent, and log in messages have been combined into a single pop-up.</li>
<li>Stardew Valley - We've updated the installation logic to better recognise mods that do not include a manifest file - including translations and asset replacers.</li>
<li>Implemented new toolbar designs across the app.</li>
<li>Added empty state for collections with no required mods.</li>
<li>Reduced the size of all buttons in the UI for better use of space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed the Xbox Game Pass (Microsoft Store) experimental toggle because it currently isn't functional for any game.</li>
<li>The version number of the app will now be shown as 3 places, rather than 4. (e.g. 0.10.0, not 0.10.0.0)</li>
<li>Installers that don't support an archive now provide a reason in the logs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the text alignment in the "Delete mods" pop-up.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue caused by folder names with trailing whitespace characters.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where FOMODs with paths could cause the app to crash.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the app would crash when view FOMOD images in a certain way.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a collection could not be installed without applying the loadout at least once.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the app would show an error message if the game/tool it launched returned a non-zero exit code (e.g. REDmod).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the app would sometimes not back up game files correctly when replaced by files from mods.</li>
<li>Fixed collections download pages opening inside the wrong game.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Epic Games release of Cyberpunk 2077 is detected but not supported.</li>
<li>The app will attempt to run the REDmod.exe even if it is not installed, resulting in an error message.</li>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually this will replace Vortex and be the go-to modding platform for Nexus. Especially nice that this time around it has full Linux support.</p>
<p>For Linux / Steam Deck you can download the AppImage from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.10.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub release</a>.</p>

      <title>COMBOLITE is a unique physics deck-builder where you build up combos to keep hitting a rock</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably the absolute weirdest deck-builder I've ever played, COMBOLITE is all about repeatedly hitting a rock to score points and activate special combos to score even more points.</p>
<p>You build up a deck of various different weapons and items, all of which have different attack powers and bonuses and attack in a specific direction. The key is in the positioning of all the items in your deck, as some will activate their bonuses based on what weapon or item came before. Add to that special powers you get that only activate when a sequence of attacks from specific positions are done in a row. It's thoroughly weird and unique but I love the idea.</p>
<p>Much like other games that have you go for points including Balatro, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/ballionaire-is-annoyingly-good-and-i-want-to-play-it-all-the-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ballionaire</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/help-ive-discovered-nubbys-number-factory-a-plinko-style-roguelike-where-you-stop-the-sun-exploding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nubby's Number Factory</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/expand-and-rearrange-your-inventory-watch-numbers-tick-up-and-break-the-game-in-lootplot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LOOTPLOT</a> - you can really do some ridiculous stuff in it where you can get a truly insane amount of points in a single run. The developer said they've seen a player end up doing "13 BILLION damage in a single turn" and they're actively encouraging you to break the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h4itpZHUB4A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90affedb377676336fc3970385fb6ddb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h4itpZHUB4A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The rock itself just floats in the middle of screen but it has physics, and so the attack directions have various other important features since you'll be hitting it all over the place. For example, certain abilities you have acquired during a run might only activate if the rock hits the ground.</p>
<p>There's a lot of things to constantly think about that you're trying to balance here across all the buffs and abilities that keeps it really engaging.</p>
<p>COMBOLITE is available now with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>The &#39;Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle&#39; on itch.io has lots of games, TTRPGs and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The itch.io store is hosting another big charity bundle full of video games, TTRPGs, zines, books, soundtracks, and asset packs in support of eSims and Crips for eSims for Gaza.</p>
<p>Quoted from the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the current escalation of violence beginning in October 2023, disability justice collective <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/25/crips-for-esims-for-gaza/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crips for eSims for Gaza</a> has raised over $2 million CAD to directly fund the activation and top-up of 18K+ eSims for Palestinians surviving genocide and occupation under the Israeli state. This mutual-aid driven communications network has supported doctors, nurses, paramedics, journalists, family members, and students</p>
<p>Despite a fragile ceasefire in early 2025, the Israeli Occupying Forces have continued to bomb the Gaza strip and block humanitarian aid from entering. The zionist state has now abandoned all pretence of ceasefire and made it clear that they intend to completely destroy the people and infrastructure of Gaza in order to expand their settlements. Meanwhile, the erasure of the genocide from mainstream media and the dismantling of international aid under fascist governments makes fundraising an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>The Crips for eSims for Gaza Itch Bundle was organized to strengthen Crips for eSims for Gaza’s critical work and to support Palestinian people fighting for their lives, for visibility, and for liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">For a minimum of $16 you can get the entire bundle that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>74 video games.</li>
<li>86 physical games.</li>
<li>14 game assets.</li>
<li>3 soundtracks.</li>
<li>5 tools.</li>
<li>17 comics.</li>
<li>26 books.</li>
<li>Plus 12 miscellaneous items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like it has some nice video games in it like Baba is You, Bleed 2, Arctico and SkateBIRD.</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum gets a big free content update with a new large UI scaling setting for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Studios / SEGA have updated the popular and well-received Two Point Museum with a fresh free content upgrade. Plus, it should feel better on Steam Deck now too.</p>
<p>Update 2.0 is quite a big one that amongst a bunch of extra free content includes a new " Very large UI scaling" they say will be "handy for Steam Deck". Nice to see a focus on UI sizing from more developers, as some game interfaces even on big desktop monitors are simply too small.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main highlights of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>23 floors &amp; wallpapers</li>
<li>2 Staff Room items &amp; 14 Staff Traits</li>
<li>Sandbox customisation options</li>
<li>A new 360° camera and the outdoor camera can now be placed inside</li>
<li>Requested quality of life changes to staff- traits in training, and more!</li>
<li>New extra large UI (handy for Steam Deck)</li>
<li>Requested Expedition Discovery changes</li>
<li>Community-inspired security changes</li>
<li>…and much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>The game has a Very Positive rating on Steam and it has Native Linux support. Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable but not Verified due to some in-game text being too small. So perhaps this new update will get it bumped up to Verified.</p>

      <title>EA rebrand and refresh their anti-cheat into EA Javelin Anticheat, still blocks Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA (Electronic Arts) have <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that EA anticheat is going through a rebrand and refresh, and will now be called EA Javelin Anticheat. <em>Note: you can check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>There's <em>no</em> good news for Linux platforms like Steam Deck with SteamOS here, since they're still intentionally blocking Linux platforms with any game that will have EA Javelin Anticheat.</p>
<p>Currently the anti-cheat is in use across series including EA SPORTS FC, EA SPORTS Madden NFL, Battlefield, F1, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies. While they also publish Apex Legends, that's still currently using Easy Anti-Cheat, but that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated to block Linux platforms too</a>.</p>
<p>EA say their anti-cheat "has prevented cheating attempts while maintaining an accuracy rate of over 99%". In a recent <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/security/news/anticheat-progress-report" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">progress report</a> they noted some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>EA Javelin Anticheat has blocked over 33 million cheat attempts across 2.2 billion PC gaming sessions since launch.</li>
<li>Now active in 14 EA titles, including Battlefield, Madden, and EA SPORTS FC franchises.</li>
<li>Built by experts in security, data, and game development to detect and stop cheating in all its forms.</li>
<li>Fair play is up—cheater presence in Battlefield 2042 matches was cut in half after recent updates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can expect all new EA published multiplayer titles to use EA Javelin Anticheat and continue to be blocked on Linux / Steam Deck. At least until the market expands enough that EA can no longer just ignore it, but for that we need Valve to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release SteamOS for more devices as they said they will</a>, and for more hardware to begin shipping with SteamOS.</p>

      <title>EA cancels multiple projects from Apex and Titanfall developer Respawn with more layoffs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More game industry news for you today. Respawn, developer of Titanfall and Apex Legends, have announced that two early-stage games have been cancelled and 100s of staff have been reportedly laid off.</p>
<p>The statement from Respawn was <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> on X/Twitter:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19040412371746004536gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19040412371746004536gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> seemed to get a tip-off on this early, as they had a news article go up about the same time as the announcement from Respawn where they reported "roughly 100 individuals are affected by the changes, including a mix of developers, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals on the Jedi team and on the incubation projects".</p>
<p>An additional report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> noted that one of the cancelled games was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe, with the total staff numbers affected around 300-400 in total across Respawn and their owner Electronic Arts.</p>

      <title>8BitDo Ultimate 2 is getting full Steam Input support for more buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of my gripes with my original 8BitDo Ultimate 2.4G Controller is that Steam Input cannot see the additional buttons on the back, but it seems that with the latest firmware updates to the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 that 8BitDo are solving the situation.</p>
<p>The problem with the original is that they're not full hardware buttons, so they cannot be mapped normally and <em>need</em> the software from 8BitDo. So that's something that seemingly cannot be solved but for their newer hardware that doesn't seem to be a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14052003151746003555gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As noted on the Steam forum in a post talking about the 8Bitdo Ultimate 2, a user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/591764731433410123/#c591769544351034155" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> improvements in a later firmware update for it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bumping this again. With a recent beta firmware for the Ultimate 2 all of its back buttons, rumble and Gyro is now detected in steam. The only thing stopping it from working fully is the steam input UI being updated to support it. You can technically mess with a layout on a different controller (like the steam deck controller) and export that as a template to configure gyro settings but that's less than ideal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Valve developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/591764731433410123/#c591769544351038572" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the UI support is planned but not ready to ship yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice! Hopefully we'll see this expanded Steam Input support for more 8Bitdo hardware and other controllers in future.</p>
<p><em>When this lands, I might actually have to upgrade to the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.</em></p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble from SEGA gets indefinitely delayed to add more features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Rumble from SEGA seems to be their answer to a Fall Guys-like multiplayer party game, it looks like it could be good fun but the global release has now been indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>While there's no new date being given, they sound quite positive on it. Seems like they just want more time to expand the content, after getting good feedback from their previews.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2951690/view/539978609968807946" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> of Steam they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to your incredible support, we’ve surpassed 1.4 million pre-registrations, a milestone that speaks volumes about your passion for Sonic Rumble. With this level of excitement, we feel an even greater responsibility to deliver an experience worthy of your time.<br/>
<br/>
We’re also very proud of the amazing positive response Sonic Rumble has already received, with App Store ratings averaging 4.8.<br/>
<br/>
As we prepare for Update 1.2, we’ll be introducing several exciting new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rumble Ranking</strong> – Compete within your league and earn rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Crews</strong> – Team up with fellow Rumblers and take on the score missions together.</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong> – Equip characters with unique abilities, adding a new layer of gameplay depth.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
We’ll be sharing more details about these new features in the coming days, so even if you can’t participate yet, you’ll be able to stay in the loop and share your thoughts with us.<br/>
<br/>
These upcoming changes will fundamentally reshape the game, and one thing has become clear: We want to create a game that evolves and stays fun for months and years to come. To build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting Sonic game our players deserve, we need more time.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, we’ve decided to postpone the Global Launch. We know this news may be disappointing, and it wasn’t a decision we made lightly. We at SEGA share that disappointment, especially because we’re making this call so close to the launch timing we had originally hoped for. However, we believe taking this extra time is the right choice for the future of Sonic Rumble.<br/>
<br/>
We don’t have a new release date to share yet, but as soon as we get closer, we’ll update you through our social media and community channels.<br/>
<br/>
When we say your support means the world to us, we truly mean it. A strong community sticks together, and we’d love for you to join us for a special <strong>Q&amp;A session on Discord</strong>, scheduled for May 2 at 1:00 PM UTC / 6:00 AM PDT / 4:00 PM EEST. We’ll answer your questions about the new features, the delay, the next steps, and more!<br/>
<br/>
Your love and support mean the world to us. We are truly grateful.<br/>
<br/>
- The Sonic Rumble Team</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 is out now on Steam and GOG - a great pick for puzzle game fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This really brings back some memories. World of Goo 2 from 2D BOY and Tomorrow Corporation has officially launched on GOG and Steam with Native Linux support. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I remember the early days of Linux gaming where we had a little surge in smaller indie games coming officially, with the original World of Goo all the way back in 2009, before even the first Humble Indie Bundle launched where we really started to see things change.</p>
<p>World of Goo 2 is like a familiar comfy blanket to wrap yourself up in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3eKwr2Sg-p0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48b563266668271f21df2fcb61a9a276.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3eKwr2Sg-p0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While a fair amount of it is perhaps on the easy side, the key is in the challenges of each individual level on the amount of balls you get, the amount of moves you used and the time it takes you to complete them. Getting through them all and getting a tick in the box for all three is a thorough challenge.</p>
<p>This is not exactly a new release, just new to other stores (after being Epic Exclusive and direct from their website), although I hadn't played the sequel until now and thankfully it retains all the charm and difficulty of the original. Nice to see the Native Linux support again too, and working to perfection on my Kubuntu 25.04 desktop from the Steam release.</p>
<p>If you loved the original, you'll appreciate this one for some more great puzzles and new mechanics that acts as a near-perfect follow-up. If you've not played the original, it's still an easy recommendation because it's just a wonderful physics-based puzzler to add to your collection.</p>
<p>One point that did become a slight nuisance is the line colour for when you're dragging the little goo balls, the contrast between the line and some backgrounds is not great to see exactly what it will connect with. A small accessibility issue but about my only problem with the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Steam release arrives with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Three new extremely difficult challenge levels.</li>
<li>Over 30 Extra Fabulous Achievements.</li>
<li>Acclaimed audio - with nearly 2 hours of music performed by over 50 musicians from the World of Goo community.</li>
<li>A Brand New Options Menu - Never before included in a 2DBOY or Tomorrow Corporation game!</li>
<li>Bug fixes and general improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>PASS Fortress turns TF2 into a competitive basketball-like and it&#39;s coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh hey, a new Team Fortress 2 (TF2) mod that's coming to Steam and it sounds like a lot of fun. PASS Fortress is one to watch. Technically, not a new mod actually. As the Steam page notes it was " Originally conceived by the 4v4 PASS Time community in 2018" but it's now coming as a "fully fledged and realized in a standalone mod".</p>
<p>A competitive basketball-like mod for Team Fortress 2 does sound quite amusing with 4 versus 4 matches, and only projectile weapons are allowed. Team classes are restricted too down to three Soldiers, one Medic, and one Demoman.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7tZuqCYjU3g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e714145ab2083cc741775fb66aae3d90.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7tZuqCYjU3g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its core <strong>PASS Fortress </strong>is a fast-paced mode rewarding skillful movement and innovation. Master your rocket jumps, ball mechanics, trimps, and surfs to secure stylish goals.</p>
<p>The standalone mod features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Polish to the original PASS Time gamemode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast-paced mode with endless skill expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended client customization to allow you to configure more in-game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rich selection of community created maps that have been worked on since 2018</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will support Linux at release. The system requirements note the game is being tested on Arch Linux.</p>
<p>We're going to see more like this thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve adding the TF2 source code to the Source SDK</a>.</p>

      <title>Wuthering Waves arrives on Steam, another with anti-cheat problems on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 12:00 BST</strong>: the developer recently edited the Steam page description to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're working to resolve Wuthering Waves' compatibility with STEAM DECK and will share updates in the community. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless they completely change the anti-cheat though or ACE gets a big update, it's still going to cause problems with anything that isn't specifically Steam Deck and SteamOS together. I've reached out to the developer to chat about it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Origin</em>al article below:</p>
<p>Here we go again. Wuthering Waves has now released on Steam from KURO GAMES and it appears to be having problems on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux due to the anti-cheat being used.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/delta-force-devs-say-desktop-linux-support-is-not-part-of-our-agenda-in-the-future/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a> and the recent <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/infinity-nikki-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-the-situation-is-odd-and-anti-cheat-blocks-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam release of Infinity Nikki</a>, it uses Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). ACE <em>can</em> allow the Steam Deck to work, only <em>sometimes</em> though. It's a really weird one because it seems the developers of ACE do some device whitelisting, and at times games with ACE only work on specific models of Steam Deck (either LCD or OLED) and <em>not</em> always both.</p>
<p>For this one, there's many reports filling up the Steam forum about issues with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3846267601745920521gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've tested across the Steam Deck LCD, Steam Deck OLED and Desktop Linux today and it <em>didn't</em> appear to let me actually play on any of them.</p>
<p>The first launch on my <u>Steam Deck LCD</u> gave me a black screen with audio, but pressing the B button showed an extra in-game download happening with a logo splash screen. After restarting once that was done, the game loaded to allow me to do their extra third-party account registration (annoying) and then to make a character. As soon as I tried joining though, the anti-cheat kicked me out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18040184271745921234gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18040184271745921234gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>While on <u>Desktop Linux</u>, I wasn't able to get <em>anything</em> to appear at all. The situation is exactly the same on <u>Steam Deck OLED</u> as both just go right back to the Steam Library. Re-testing then on my Steam Deck LCD, and it did still at least load to the menu. It seems they might go further than just whitelisting the Steam Deck as a device with ACE, I'm starting to think it locks out additional Linux systems once you've logged into one which may be why some people see it working on one Deck but others do not.</p>
<p>Really frustrating. Valve need to sort this situation out if they want the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">future SteamOS devices</a> to continue to be a success for more players. Online multiplayer as a whole for Linux platforms from Steam Deck to Desktop is getting messy due to so many different types of anti-cheat and their various different detection and blocking methods.</p>

      <title>Starfox-esque 3D Shooter Ex-Zodiac gets a major update with a new level</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ex-Zodiac is a 3D on-rails shooter made in the spirit of the classic Starfox, it's currently in Early Access with Linux support and a major update just released.</p>
<p>This update adds in a wild-west ground-vehicle-based stage named MIRAGE complete with arches, canyons, nuke-hauling trains, robot horses and cowboys! Sounds like quite a riot. Seems the full release may still be a while away, with developer Ben Hickling working solo on most parts of it apart from the music.</p>
<p>You can see their brief update teaser trailer on it below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style.</li>
<li>11 main levels and 6 bonus levels currently (more than 12 will be available after full release).</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac.</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis.</li>
<li>Barrel rolls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Retro Disney themed shooter MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks awesome in the latest trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The inspiration is obvious to anyone who has seen classic Disney cartoons on this one and I'm all for it. MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks like a lot of fun and the latest trailer shows off more weapons. <em>I initially highlighted this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/mouse-pi-for-hire-looks-like-steamboat-willie-as-a-fps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in August 2024</a>.</em></p>
<p>I'm genuinely impressed by how stylish this one looks, and I really can't wait to play it. There's no release date just yet but they have confirmed it will get a Steam release sometime this year. It will most likely run well with Valve's Proton on Linux, and it's single-player so no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> nonsense.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4nt4dqP9wtQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52cf4d873e4516d364730187dd2f2f7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4nt4dqP9wtQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The trailer shows off experimental weapons including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CLEAN-D Automatic Turpentine Cleanser - <strong>The Turpentine Gun:</strong> A must-have for every household, the Turpentine Gun is capable of literally erasing the harshest of “stains”, with its patented mixture of toxins and corrosive design. Clean up the streets of Mouseburg with this nifty appliance!</li>
<li>COOL-D Cold Steam Applier - <strong>The Freeze Gun: </strong>Stay frosty with the Freeze Gun, an icy device that can keep your cheese fresh and freeze your foes in place (side effects may include accidental shattering). Forget the ice box and be one of the first in the world to try out its arctic breeze!</li>
<li>MIND-D Self-Aware Attitude Changer - <strong>The Conscious Gun: </strong>Our most mesmerizing product yet, the Conscious Gun is all about hypnotizing and subduing the competition. Making friends has never been so mind-blowingly easy, especially at these low-low prices!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">As for some highlights of the game overall:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iconic Style:</strong> The monochromatic, hand-drawn rubber hose animation and original retro jazz soundtrack are created with the same techniques of the era. The playful weaponry, whimsical health display, and cartoon chaos add a light-hearted twist to each death.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable Power-Ups:</strong> Enhance melee combat with a can of Spike-D Spinach, or even attach Pepper’s mouse tail to a Grappling Hook to rapidly traverse Mouseburg’s rooftops.</li>
<li><strong>Fast-paced Action: </strong>Discover and combine powerful upgrades with comical weapons to violently blow apart enemies. From crackling Tommy guns to explosive firepower, use a mix of combat styles that adjust to play style preferences to defeat enemies in epic fights and challenging boss battles.</li>
<li><strong>A City of Danger: </strong>Join Jack Pepper’s diverse city playground spanning a movie studio, dockland, casino, swamp marshland, and underground sewer network locations. But beware of what lurks beneath the surface! Embark on a gripping detective adventure and encounter a mischievous cast of big bads as Pepper takes a gritty journey to the dark side of town.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Solve the Mystery: </strong>Earn rewards from minigames and side quests as Pepper uncovers clues and collectibles that pay homage to iconic pop culture, films, and cartoons.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Metal platformer Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior from Chaosmonger now on Kickstarter and smashed the funding goal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a world inspired by the lore and iconic concept albums of the metal music band Voivod, the latest retro-inspired game from Chaosmonger Studio is live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piovesan/voivod-the-nuclear-warrior" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>It's already managed to smash the initial €17,500 crowdfunding goal, so they're working towards special stretch goals if they get more funding to expand the game further.</p>
<p>The developers said they're working closely with the band to "supervise the entire creative process, ensuring that every aspect of the game stays true to the band's deep and intricate lore" which includes the "visual design to the soundtrack and gameplay elements, the band is deeply involved in shaping the experience to be an authentic tribute to their legacy".</p>

      <title>Multiple Star Wars classics join the GOG Preservation Program with a big sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> Preservation Program has expanded once again. After recently adding a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/breath-of-fire-iv-for-pc-returns-with-an-updated-gog-release-plus-more-games-join-the-gog-preservation-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">re-release of Breath of Fire IV for PC</a>, GOG are now keeping multiple classic Star Wars games up to date.</p>
<p>Announced ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2025_may_the_4th" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">May the 4th celebrations with a big sale</a>, it's good to see more games will continue to work on modern systems.</p>
<p>GOG said the following games "have been updated to run as smoothly as possible on modern systems and are now made to live forever":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_dark_forces" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="">STAR WARS™ Dark Forces (Classic, 1995)</a></p>
</li>

<p>Quite pleasing to see GOG put their focus back into retro games, giving their store some extra unique value once again.</p>
<p>You can play games from GOG on Linux platforms (including Steam Deck) with the help of tools like the Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris and others.</p>

      <title>Delta Force devs say Desktop Linux support is &#39;not part of our agenda in the future&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For anyone hoping to play Delta Force on Desktop Linux, the developer Team Jade has given a pretty clear no. That's despite it working on Steam Deck due to the anti-cheat they've used.</p>
<p>Much like a few other games including the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/infinity-nikki-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-the-situation-is-odd-and-anti-cheat-blocks-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam launch of Infinity Nikki</a>, it's using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), which developers can activate some sort of device whitelist to allow the Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>Writing on Reddit in reply to a user question about Linux, the Game Director Shadow Guo, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k8evyo/comment/mpc3vcd/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">answered</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We appreciate the love from Linux users, but unfortunately support for Linux Desktop is not part of our agenda in the future. Without a Windows PC, you can still enjoy Delta Force on mobile and Google Play Games on PC, thank you again for the support!</p>

      <title>Infinity Nikki on Steam works on Steam Deck but the situation is odd and anti-cheat blocks Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Infinity Nikki has now launched on Steam to suck away more of your time. It works on Steam Deck with Proton but the anti-cheat is blocking it working on Desktop Linux. The developers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/infinity-nikki-devs-are-working-on-steam-deck-support-for-the-steam-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously confirmed to GamingOnLinux</a> that it would work on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, and as I expected to be the case, we're again seeing a split platform between the Steam Deck with Valve's SteamOS Linux and normal Desktop Linux. This is due to Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) being used, which has some sort of device whitelist for the Steam Deck running SteamOS specifically. This is the same thing that happens with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/delta-force-developer-mentions-they-will-look-at-supporting-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mecha BREAK</a>. <em>You can see more Linux / Steam Deck compatibility on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. </em></p>
<p>On <u>Desktop Linux</u> you can get the launcher to appear, but the game itself will not load once you hit the Start Game button, as it just quits to your Steam Library.</p>
<p>For <u>Steam Deck LCD</u> (which I tried first), the game will load up instantly and skips the launcher and you're able to get in-game with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. So at least on the LCD you can play. Performance didn't seem very good though, below 30FPS with all minimum details set.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, the game will <strong>not</strong> launch on my <u>Steam Deck OLED</u>, it just throws up an error about the "driver could not be loaded". I've tried repeated runs, every time it works on my Steam Deck LCD but not the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4428436071745913211gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4428436071745913211gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Frustrating! Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) is a real <em>nuisance</em> with more games beginning to use it. Odd, since it works on one system for me and not the other, despite them both being a Steam Deck. Seems I'm not the only one, as a player noted on the Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3164330/discussions/0/600777026050243687/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> they're seeing a similar problem between the LCD and OLED models.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fcNGApQj3go"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0c994a7f551fe2aaf1012cc8a650625.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fcNGApQj3go" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An unfortunate situation that I really do think Valve need to solve at some point. My real hope is that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS moving from Steam Deck to more handhelds will help this situation</a>, but that may come with other problems and developers might still approve specific devices and SteamOS specifically.</p>

      <title>System76 COSMIC Alpha 7 is out with new accessibility features, global shortcuts and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 continue building up their desktop environment COSMIC, with a 7th Alpha release now available for testing built on top of Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS alpha.</p>
<p>Even though I'm firmly happy with the latest KDE Plasma, because it does everything I need, I'm still quite keen to see the finished product when it comes to COSMIC as they're doing some pretty interesting stuff with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/81687771745594081gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/81687771745594081gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13011144371745594083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13011144371745594083gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 7</em></p>
<p>In the latest release they've tweaked Workspaces so you can click and drag them around and you can pin them to ensure they stick around even when empty too. There's also various new accessibility features they've highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic/issues/811" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">High Contrast Mode</a> uses a high-contrast theme affecting various elements for easier visibility — calculated automatically by COSMIC’s theming system using a specialized method.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-settings/pull/1062" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Color Filters</a><strong> </strong>add a filter to address common forms of colorblindness: Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia. For those with sensitive eyesight, a grayscale filter is also available.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-comp/issues/895" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Color Inversion</a> changes theme colors using a different calculation for the purpose of helping those affected by colorblindness differentiate between like colors.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-settings/issues/653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mono Sound</a> aids those with hearing loss by combining left-right sound channels into a single channel for both ears. We plan to add more accessibility features to COSMIC in future releases!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also improvements to the magnifier, global shortcuts for applications even when they're not in focus, improved fractional scaling for XWayland, there's a new <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/issues/220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">seek ahead search</a> option for their file manager, new sound settings and lots of bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening set for a public playtest May 9-12 but the anti-cheat concerns me for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is set to release on June 10th, and to ensure their servers are working well they've announced a major public playtest will go live in May.</p>
<p>The Beta Weekend is due to be live between May 9th - 12th. You can already request access right now, by going to the Steam page and hitting the Request Access button:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16934378931745590520gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This Beta has no NDA, so anyone playing it will be able to share all the details. During the event you'll be able to play through the first 20 hours of the game which gives you "most of Act 1 of the story".</p>
<p>They'll also be giving away Beta access keys during the Global Dune: Awakening LAN Party Broadcast on May 10th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="63gMIwsCJhM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa6dd4d30df9bd9ade06cf7606d9f3f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/63gMIwsCJhM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do have one <strong>major</strong> <em>concern</em> for anyone hoping to play it on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck, which is the anti-cheat situation. The store page doesn't actually list any, but it appears to be using BattlEye (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2995470/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). So unless Funcom actively choose to enable it, this will result in another game that doesn't work for us.</p>
<p>Even if the Playtest works, we've seen plenty of times before where a Playtest / Beta worked and the main release did not. So it will be good to get a firm answer on this. I've tried to speak to Funcom and their press teams, but no one has yet replied to confirm or deny if the anti-cheat will be enabled for us. <em>I've bumped up some emails about this again today, will update on any reply.</em></p>
<p>At least from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/dune-awakening-looks-like-it-may-be-playable-on-steam-deck-benchmark-tested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the benchmark on Steam Deck</a>, it looked like it might be <em>playable</em> from a performance point of view.</p>
<p>Once we do know, it will be listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Love board games and pure chaos? Fortune Avenue is a new spin on Monopoly out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, Fortune Street is the latest game from Binogure Studio (City Game Studio, Sneak In) that puts a fresh, fast and chaotic spin on the classic Monopoly. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>In the game you take turns to move across a board filled with surprises and opportunities. Each player participates in random game-changing events (there's over 30 of them) that can really mess with everyone. The added randomness really makes it feel different to classic Monopoly, like Jail being replaced with an ice floe that could transform into a luxury cruise and Free Parking instead being an airport that allows strategic movement across the board.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2bxPmjeBtgU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/051ee50a61e55592bed544d096ef020e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2bxPmjeBtgU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can play it offline against AI bots and other people and you can also play online too. You can even play the game as a team if you fancy a bit of co-op against others.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned the Early Access period will last for probably around 2 years, so they can really polish it up and add in new features, although it's already a complete experience to play through. In their current roadmap they plan to add in custom game modes, a board editor, more customization, Steam Workshop support and much more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Board Elements: From melting ice floes to bustling airports, every corner of the board holds a surprise.</li>
<li>Strategic Rule Voting: Every 12 dice rolls, players vote on new rules that can drastically alter the game's dynamics.</li>
<li>Speed Up Mechanism: A helicopter targets the poorest players, ensuring a fast-paced game that minimizes frustration.</li>
<li>Elimination Bonus: Gain a $100K bonus for each player you eliminate, adding a competitive edge.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Measures: With physics-based dice and wheel of fortune, plus advanced obfuscation and VAC, the integrity of the game is maintained.</li>
<li>Rich Multiplayer Experience: Peer-to-peer connectivity with a robust recovery mechanism ensures seamless gameplay.</li>
<li>Diverse Game Pieces and Boards: Choose from 12 unique pieces and explore 4 different themed boards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lost For Swords is a unique deck-building dungeon crawler that&#39;s different each time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of dungeon crawlers and deck-builders but Lost For Swords manages to come off a little more unique thanks to the way it shuffles everything together. I had a really great time with some early versions of this one, played it for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Each floor is made up of cards, which are shuffled together with your currently built deck of equipment cards and then placed randomly across the board for you to explore. As you move from tile to tile, you'll pick up your equipment but you only get to use each item once. So a lot of Lost For Swords is about managing the individual steps you take, a game of tactical planning on deciding your route and how to best deal with each enemy. It's really interesting to play!</p>

      <title>Replicube is an open-ended programming puzzle game about making 3D voxels</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Walaber Entertainment LLC (JellyCar Worlds, Parking Garage Rally Circuit) have just released Replicube, an open-ended programming puzzle game where you make 3D voxel-based objects.</p>
<p>Could serve as a fun and interesting way to get yourself or others into programming and test your knowledge. A truly nerdy puzzle game that's for sure. Check out the Steam trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UFFW4NlNnLg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0196353bf41f1aa5f1226597ed249001.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UFFW4NlNnLg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SOLVE PUZZLES - The main content of the game involves trying to match a reference object by working out code that will replicate it.  There is no "right answer", if your code produces the same object, it's correct!</li>
<li>PLAY AROUND - You can always open the voxel tool in "free edit" mode and just play around, making whatever you want.  In addition to the main 3D voxel editor, there is also a bonus 2D image editor for writing code to generate 2D images and GIF animations.  You can even save your image creation as the background image in the "OS" interface of the game!</li>
<li>JOIN THE COMMUNITY - Every puzzle has 2 leaderboards, measuring source code size, and execution efficiency. Often optimizing for one will be at the expense of the other.  If you enjoy trying to squeeze a bit more out of your code, the leaderboards are waiting!</li>
<li>There is also an in-game online forum where players can share their own voxel creations, and even challenge other players to try to recreate them, all presented in an old-school online forum wrapper.</li>
<li>EXPORT YOUR CREATIONS - Generated 3D voxel objects can be exported into common formats to bringing into other 3D creation tools. Generated 2D images and animations can also be exported as png or gif for sharing online.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The release arrives with Native Linux support and it already has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders launches later this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders from Homo Narrans Studio is now on the road to release, with it being confirmed a GOG and Steam release will happen this year with Native Linux support. I originally wrote about this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/check-out-the-new-demo-for-casebook-1899-the-leipzig-murders/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2022 when it had a Kickstarter</a> and it was planned for 2023 but took longer than expected.</p>
<p>Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders is a richly atmospheric, retro-inspired point-and-click adventure that immerses players in a rarely explored chapter of European history. Set in Leipzig, Germany at the dawn of the 20th century, the game invites players to step into the role of Detective Joseph Kreiser as he investigates a string of mysterious murders across the city. As Kreiser, you’ll examine clues, interrogate suspects, and piece together evidence in a classic point-and-click format enhanced with thoughtful design.</p>

<p>"The release of Casebook 1899 – The Leipzig Murders is an enourmous milestone for me personally," shared solo developer Gregor Müller. "After four years of dedication, learning, and countless late nights, I'm proud to share my first commercial game with the players."</p>
<p>One to put on your watchlist if you love the classics.</p>

      <title>FBC: Firebreak from Remedy releases June 17, aiming to be Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for people wanting to play Remedy Entertainment's new game FBC: Firebreak, as it's releasing June 17th and it will be playable on Steam Deck (and so Desktop Linux too thanks to Valve's Proton).</p>
<p>I did email the developer to ask about if it will run, and if they planned any <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>, which could have caused problems but they didn't reply. However, they did recently do a developer livestream where the confirmed very clearly how they're aiming for it to be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The Communications Director, Thomas Puha, was mentioning how it will run on lower-spec PCs. Then the Game Director, Mike Kayatta, jumps in to note "Steam Deck as well". After that the Community Manager, Julius Fondem, notes they're "aiming for Steam Deck Verified, that was very important for us".</p>
<p>Check it out at about 1:33:42</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0s2x2a35wP8?rel=0&amp;start=5622"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/youtube_cache_default.png"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0s2x2a35wP8?rel=0&amp;start=5622" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is Remedy Entertainment's first self-published game and will be available for $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is a cooperative first-person shooter set within a mysterious federal agency under assault by otherworldly forces. As a years-long siege on the agency’s headquarters reaches its boiling point, only Firebreak— the Bureau’s most versatile unit—has the gear and the guts to plunge into the building’s strangest crises, restore order, contain the chaos, and fight to reclaim control.</p>
<p>Dive into the Federal Bureau of Control’s (FBC) unpredictable and extradimensional headquarters during its darkest—and strangest—hours. As one of the FBC’s fearless first responders, you and your team are on call to confront everything from reality-warping anomalies to otherworldly monsters... no matter the odds. Will you contain the chaos or finally lose control?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remedy have said they will continue to expand it after release. In the press release they said "All future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins".</p>

      <title>Lenovo - Legion Go S with Valve&#39;s SteamOS gets a price increase at Best Buy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Best Buy have recently increased the price they're listing for the two upcoming Lenovo - Legion Go S models with Valve's SteamOS. They seem to have taken down pre-orders too, with it now just being listed as "Coming Soon".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The new prices could be pretty off-putting. Here's the new USA pricing (credit to cdubbsworld on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1k7d6va/leigon_go_s_steamos_price_hike_again/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-go-steamos-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-nebula/6619192.p?skuId=6619192" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AMD Ryzen Z2 Go</a> edition is now $599.99 before it was $549.99.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-steamos-32gb-with-1tb-ssd-nebula/6619188.p?skuId=6619188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</a> edition is now $829.99 before it was $749.99.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? The most probable reason are the mess of <em>tariffs</em> going on right now (thanks Trump). Prices of lots of things have been all over the place due to it. This isn't even the first price increase. Originally, Lenovo said they<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> expected it to launch for $499.99</a> for the Z2 Go edition — $100 is quite a big bump now from their original plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18783169831745574668gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Both models are listed as releasing on May 25th.</p>
<p>At this point, it <em>might</em> just be better to stick with the tried and tested Steam Deck directly from Valve. For the price, it's not like Lenovo are giving you much more than what Valve already do with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED</a> top model being $649.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA disclose new security flaw in their Linux GPU drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA sent out a security bulletin today to reveal a fresh security flaw found in their Linux GPU drivers. So it’s time to get updating again to be safe.</p>
<p>Noted down as CVE‑2025‑23244 here’s their explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow an unprivileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a number of different driver series, so you’ll need to check what you’re currently on to see the best version upgrade. If you’re on any of these you’ll be fine: 535.247.01, 550.163.01, 570.133.07 and 575.51.02.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5630/~/security-bulletin%3A-nvidia-gpu-display-driver---april-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA website</a>.</p>

      <title>Frostrail from the devs of Barotrauma &#39;eager&#39; to support Linux with a &#39;tentative yes&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Barotrauma devs FakeFish recently revealed Frostrail during the Triple-I Initiative event, and they're giving a "tentative yes" for Linux support. Swapping out a submarine and cold ocean for a train and frozen wasteland, Frostrail is a ruthless open world survival FPS where you have to carefully manage your train to keep pushing forward.</p>
<p>Speaking in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3517740/view/520837698904129747" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said this about Linux support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Will Frostrail be MacOs/Linux compatible?</strong></p>
<p>One of our developers is primarily working on Linux, and we are eager to open Frostrail to the Linux gaming community. So that’s a tentative yes at this point at least for Linux. Our number one priority is making the PC version smooth and stable for Early Access release, and Linux/Mac support is also kept in mind every step of the way. However, we can only fully confirm support for these OS upon release.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x_59w8EP9Qs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6d343e0208ab4c3619bf58eaccf4780.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x_59w8EP9Qs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The publisher, Shiro Games, recently revealed that it amassed over 100,000 wishlists on Steam only 4 days after the reveal. Clearly there's a lot of interest in this one!</p>
<p>It will enter Early Access in 2026.</p>

      <title>Discord CEO steps down, replaced with former Activision Blizzard CSO as they work towards being a public company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Discord forces in more adverts and paid customization towards becoming a public company the CEO and Co-Founder, Jason Citron, has announced they're stepping down as CEO.</p>
<p>Citron will be moving to become a member of the Board of Directors and Advisor to the CEO. The new CEO, starting from Monday April 28th, will be Humam Sakhnini who worked at Activision Blizzard as Chief Strategy Officer and later King (developer of Candy Crush Saga).</p>
<p>There's been a lot of mixed reports on Discord's plan to become a public company, with this now actually being directly confirmed by Citron in the announcement <a href="https://discord.com/blog/passing-the-torch" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> noting that Sakhnini was hired to "lead Discord through our next chapter of growth and someday becoming a public company".</p>
<p>From the separate <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-appoints-new-ceo-humam-sakhnini" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“Building Discord over the last decade has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. From the very beginning, our mission has been about bringing people together around games. It’s a mission I’ve dedicated my career to, and I'm confident that passing the torch to Humam is the right evolution for Discord's future. His deep gaming industry expertise and proven track record of scaling businesses while fostering genuine friendships through play and shared experiences positions us perfectly for our next phase of growth. I believe this transition will accelerate our momentum and unlock even greater possibilities for Discord, our consumers, partners, and the overall gaming ecosystem in the years ahead.” — Jason Citron, Discord Co-Founder</p>
<p>"I want to express my sincere gratitude to Jason Citron as he moves into a new role on the Board of Directors. We’ve worked together closely for more than a decade, and Discord is the product of his incredible vision for a new company that could redefine how gamers connect. The fact that the company has scaled to reach and delight millions and millions of people is a testament to the power of that vision. I’ve known our incoming CEO Humam Sakhnini for many years as well, and I’ve long admired his work and strategic thinking. I believe he is the ideal leader for this new phase of Discord’s history, with his deep understanding of the game business generally, and particularly the nuances of customer acquisition and modern revenue creation which are so important in today’s game business. I am looking forward to working with him to help realize Discord’s long-term potential.” — Mitch Lasky, Discord Board of Directors </p>
<p>“I'm incredibly excited to join Discord at such a pivotal moment. Discord stands as a massive, foundational part of the gaming ecosystem that millions of players, developers, and publishers rely on every day. What Jason and Discord co-founder and CTO Stan Vishnevskiy have built is truly remarkable — a platform with an undeniable product-market fit where hundreds of millions of people connect around their passion for gaming and shared interests. I look forward to working with Stan and Discord's talented team to scale our business while staying true to the company's core mission and the special connection it has with player communities. We're still at the beginning of gaming's impact on entertainment and culture, and Discord is perfectly positioned to play a central role in that future.” — Humam Sakhnini, Incoming Discord CEO</p>
<hr/>
<p>We all know how going public goes right? Let the enshittification commence (er — continue?). For now, Discord at least still works quite well, but I have a lot of concerns about how their work towards going public will ruin Discord as we know it.</p>
<p>What happens if it really does go bad? Where does everyone go for chat then? There's not exactly many other actually <em>good</em> (and modern feeling) options that have the range of services Discord provides.</p>

      <title>11 bit studios are remaking the original Frostpunk in Unreal Engine 5 with Frostpunk 1886</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios have announced today that their popular city building survival strategy game Frostpunk from 2018 is getting a remake in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Why? Well, they no longer develop their own in-house game engine they called "Liquid Engine" and Frostpunk 2 also uses Unreal Engine 5. They said they've wanted to continue working on the original Frostpunk, but their old engine was showing a lot of limitations. So they're going back to the start with Frostpunk 1886.</p>
<p>They said it's not just a plain recreation though. It will have "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer" and serve as a "great introduction to the world of Frostpunk for newcomers, but also a title that die-hard fans of the game would love to play on repeat". They also have plans to add in "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings" and more. 11 bit studios are also finally looking to add in official mod support too.</p>

<p>It will release sometime in 2027. The current version is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, and works well on desktop Linux with Proton (Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/323190?device=pc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>).</p>
<p>Personally, I've still not had the chance to actually play it. I don't even have a copy of it. Am I really missing out on something here? Let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Polterguys: Possession Party is a funny competitive party game worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Polterguys: Possession Party from Madorium Ltd is a party game that's highly competitive. As a bunch of ghosts, you and friends are trying to get away from a monster, so you need to sabotage everyone else to survive. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Since you're a ghost, you need to fly around and posses various items to gain just a little protection. While your friends are doing the same, it's a game of last ghost standing. Speed is not the key, tactics are, you're trying not to get caught while ensuring everyone else does. You get various powerups to help with that, and each level has a different mechanic to help you try and trap others or hide from the monster.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qXGoczoZ5jo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2fdce5cdc6ad0c9b25a3e10a25b557bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qXGoczoZ5jo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see a party game that isn't local multiplayer only as well. You can do both local and online play, so it has the best of both worlds for friends near and far to compete. A nice casual competitive party game that's a good time with a few friends, a spin on hide and seek.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer supports up to 8 players.</li>
<li>Split-screen couch play for up to 4 players, who can also go online together and play as a party.</li>
<li>10 levels packed with physics-based traps and toys.</li>
<li>20 collectable costume possessions to discover and level up.</li>
<li>Daily and weekly challenges.</li>
<li>Weekly leaderboards.</li>
<li>“The Spooky Trail” to travel along for progression.</li>
<li>Personal space called the 'haunt' that can be customized with in-game addons.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support. Valve have not currently rated it for Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS fixes issues with AMD FSR3 on Steam Deck and adds a Photo Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KOEI TECMO recently released a small update for DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS that released in January, making it more playable on Steam Deck. Valve have currently rated it Steam Deck Playable. It's not Steam Deck Verified yet, as some of the in-game text is a bit too small.</p>
<p>With Ver. 1.0.0.7 released April 23rd, the developer fixed up some graphical distortions on Steam Deck when you enable AMD FSR3. Nice to see direct support for issues like this.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2384580/announcements/detail/527592442371768338" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional Features and Adjustments</strong><br/>
• Added Photo Mode. To start it, open the menu on the World Map or in battle and press the TouchPad button.<br/>
• Added Lion Dragon Armor as an outfit for the protagonist. You can try it on by selecting Change Outfit at your current base.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br/>
• Fixed an issue causing graphical distortion when AMD FSR3 is enabled on Steam Deck.<br/>
• Fixed minor bugs.<br/>
Note: Controller buttons have been labeled according to PS5 console standards.</p>

<p>It's currently 18% off on Fanatical. Not the lowest it has been but close to it so seems like a good deal if you wanted to pick it up right now.</p>

      <title>Check out the unique demo for Insectile, a bug-catching creature collection game with puzzle-battles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Insectile is an upcoming game that blends together exploration, creature collection and puzzle battles into what looks like quite a unique and charming experience. It will have Native Linux support and a demo is now available.</p>
<p><em>I've been getting some classic retro Pokémon vibes playing the demo but with a unique spin on it. </em></p>
<p>Here you're exploring giant gardens to find various different types of bugs that you store in jars, to bring them out during combat. The combat side of it is where the puzzle element to it comes in, as the battles aren't just plain attack versus hit-points. Instead each "Insectile" (what they call the creatures) have a different shape, and you need to slot all of yours onto the board of enemies to fit together to attack.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gbjJ445F_oI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/597a47f09522d31f102327f39268f733.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gbjJ445F_oI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo is but a small taste, but I'm keen to see more from the full game on this one.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest point and click adventure from Wadjet Eye Games is out now with Old Skies sending you through time. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: "Fia Quinn is a time traveler, accompanying clients of the ChronoZen Time Travel Agency on jumps to other eras to make sure they don't rewrite important aspects of history. Some of these people are merely curious. Others have unresolved business. As long as they can pay for the trip, their motivations don't matter to Fia... until they do. Jump with Fia into seven time-travel cases spanning two centuries, from the speakeasies of Prohibition to the vicious gangs of the Gilded Age to the World Trade Center on September 10, 2001. Solve temporal problems, survive paradoxes, and resolve the mistakes of the past or die trying -- as many times as it takes."</p>

      <title>Colony building sim Mountaincore is now free to play and open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A complicated history for this one, with the developer Rocket Jump Technology no longer existing as a business. The previous iteration of the game named King under the Mountain went open source <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/king-under-the-mountain-mountaincore-went-open-source-as-developer-shuts-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in January 2024</a>, and now what was to be the big revamp is also open source.</p>
<p>Still a shame what happened. In short: the developer made King under the Mountain, then an unnamed "well-known" publisher came in with funding to greatly improve and expand it but they had to re-launch it under a new name (Mountaincore). The publisher eventually backed out, but allowed the developer to continue with the funded work and still release it. Early Access wasn't enough to keep Mountaincore going, so they eventually shut the studio.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19218592071745410823gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Having both versions of the game now open source is a great outcome though, another big project for people to learn from and perhaps continue elsewhere.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Start with 7 dwarves but you can build and support a population of hundreds.</li>
<li>A simulated world with changing weather and seasons that have a big impact on gameplay.</li>
<li>Every one of your settlers has their own needs and desires to fulfil as they work together for the common good.</li>
<li>A deep crafting tree that leaves no natural resource unused, tied together into satisfying production chains.</li>
<li>Progress through skill tiers to craft better tools and weapons.</li>
<li>Trade with merchants to increase your wealth even further.</li>
<li>Form up and train your military to battle monsters and invaders...</li>
<li>...or play in Peaceful Mode to chill out with a relaxing city-builder experience.</li>
<li>Twitch integration (using viewer names for settlers) to encourage stream audience interaction.</li>
<li>Built "Mod-first" so that everything is moddable.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/rossturner/mountaincore" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Since it's under the MIT license, you can do pretty much anything with it.</p>

<p>Coming sometime soon to Early Access, Melvor Idle 2 has been announced by developer Games by Malcs. Building upon the success and popularity of the first game, but with some big new features to hook you in.</p>
<p>The developer said: "Melvor Idle 2 is a direct sequel to Melvor Idle, with almost every single area upgraded or enhanced in some way when compared to the original. We have taken everything we’ve learnt from Melvor Idle and cranked up the dial in hopes to create an experience that far surpasses the original. Melvor Idle 2 introduces brand new Skills, increases base game level caps, reworks existing Skills and completely updates the visual aesthetics to give a whole new look and feel."</p>
<p>Interestingly, this time they've completely changed how they make the game too. They've gone with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> for it. They've said monetisation will be the same as the original, a standard price ($14.99 USD) with paid large expansions in future and plenty of free updates.</p>

<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle &amp; Weather:</strong> Enjoy a more immersive experience with a customisable <strong>dynamic day/night cycle &amp; weather system</strong> that adds visual flavor and atmosphere to your adventure.</li>

      <title>Stone Age co-op farming &amp; life sim Roots of Pacha gets a major &#39;Sun and Moon&#39; v1.3 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roots of Pacha is basically like a Stone Age version of Stardew Valley, a co-op farming and life sim from Sofa Den. The Sun and Moon update is a big one and it's out now. The game has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More about the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore the Mograni Mountains and Yakuan Islands, two new regions with three subregions each, learn new practices and rituals, and see the majestic sights of the neighboring Mograni and Yakuan cultures that built them. </p>
<p>The stars will align to form new Ideas like ironworking as well as new mechanics like bug catching. Dig deep into an intertwining cave system opened by hidden sigils that unlock new Pachan possibilities and unveil ancestral secrets. Learn about the other clan’s ways of living by joining their sun and moon festivals, playing “Dice” with the Mograni, and performing music with the Yakuans.</p>
<p>Travel to the lands of the sun to find flora like Rye, Lentil Seeds, and Soaproot to create life-altering inventions like the soap processor. Tame new fauna in the lands of the moon, like dodos and pandas. Expand your own Pachan world with these clan’s ways. Foster harmonious coexistence by helping each clan develop their own Ideas for growth. Meet new characters, including new romance options like the Mograni silver fox, Azkel, and Sayra, a Yakuan resident recovering from past heartbreak.</p>
<p>Trade with new friends for fresh outfits, discover the art of setting sail on a raft to fish, and decorate your home with new goods from the Mograni and Yakuans to live the Pachan life like never before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FrHLB9qGL5k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa54e6f08d178aafe4a65bf6a90db929.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FrHLB9qGL5k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The journey of making Roots of Pacha has been an incredible experience,” said Timothy Dadone Nasello, Co-Founder of Soda Den. “We’re grateful to everyone who’s been a part of it, and especially to the community that formed around it and that, just like the game, wonders about our human origins and the limitless possibilities of our curiosity.”</p>

      <title>Mesa NVK (NVIDIA Vulkan driver) now Vulkan 1.4 conformant on Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand has announced a nice big milestone for the open source Mesa driver NVK, the NVIDIA Vulkan driver, as it has expanded Vulkan 1.4 conformance to now include Maxwell+ (Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs).</p>
<p>NVK was already working for Turing and above, so this will bring support all the way back to GPUs released in 2014 like the GeForce GTX 750 and GeForce GTX 750 Ti. Plus the GeForce 800M mobile series, GeForce 900 series and GeForce 10 series. <em>A lot of GeForce 700 series cards are on an older generation though including Fermi and Kepler, more on that below.</em></p>
<p>In a blog post they've said that the current plan is to now have NVK enabled for all of them going with Mesa 25.1, which is due to release in early May. However, they're currently waiting on Mesa 25.2 before they switch those GPUs over to using Zink (OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan) by default.</p>
<p>Support may come to even older GPUs too. For Kepler, they need to add in compiler support, but they said "the driver generally works" already and work has already begun to enable it but it's likely quite some time away so no promises are being made. Fermi is more challenging to do due to the age of it, so it's "hard to predict whether Fermi support will happen at all".</p>

      <title>Steam will soon list what accessibility features games support on store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally. Something many have been asking for Valve to do for a long time now, and something I've pointed out multiple times across various articles - Steam pages will soon list what accessibility features games support on store pages.</p>
<p>Valve announced the upcoming change in a Steamworks Developer post, noting that they'll be giving developers time to fill out some extra questions on what their games support.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This will include features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gameplay options, like adjustable difficulty.</li>
<li>Audio accessibility features, including custom volume controls and narrated game menus.</li>
<li>Visual accessibility features, including adjustable text size and color alternatives.</li>
<li>Input options, which include chat speech-to-text and text-to-speech.</li>
</ul>
<p>They don't say when store pages on the web and inside the Steam Client will update to show it other than sometime later this year.</p>
<p>There will be new store search options so you can look for games that have specific features like text sizing options, saving anywhere and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19289220721745398302gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19289220721745398302gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Credit: Valve</em></p>
<p>And how these features will look on store pages when it all goes live:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5411413461745398303gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5411413461745398303gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Credit: Valve</em></p>
<p>I'm <strong>really</strong> happy to see this. Especially playing across different systems, having games with tiny text is just annoying me more and more as time goes on. Even more so on Steam Deck with the smaller screen. Being able to search directly for games that let me scale it up will be wonderful. Hopefully plenty of developers will fill it out, but it's <em>not</em> actually required of developers to do so.</p>
<p>The community site <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> has already added support for the new accessibility tags too in their search. Nice.</p>

      <title>Valve continues preparing the Steam Deck OS to release for more devices with SteamOS 3.7.4 Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamOS 3.7.4 Preview is out now and it contains only a few bug fixes, but one sounds pretty darn important to give non-Steam Deck users a good experience.</p>
<p>We still don't know exactly when Valve will release the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">promised SteamOS for more handhelds</a> yet, but it's coming along with each new SteamOS Preview release bringing some work towards it. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/valves-steamos-3-7-3-preview-improves-support-for-asus-and-lenovo-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Beta</a>, for example, had improvements for Asus and Lenovo handhelds.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in SteamOS 3.7.4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from earlier 3.7 releases wherein corrupt Steam installs would fail to automatically self-repair in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying some incorrect GPU metrics in level four.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bootloader crash on certain non-Steam Deck devices, including qemu-based virtual machines.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered revealed, it&#39;s out now and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bethesda Softworks today officially revealed and launched The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, after days of leaks. And from what they've revealed, I'm very excited to give it a go. It's even Steam Deck Verified right from the get-go with Valve verifying it against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>Bethesda teamed up with Virtuos for the remaster using Unreal Engine 5. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wFJ3PZuAjK4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dbff383f4fab22e4620374d985b9406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wFJ3PZuAjK4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The official bit from Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered modernizes the 2006 Game of the Year with all new stunning visuals and refined gameplay. Explore the vast landscape of Cyrodiil like never before and stop the forces of Oblivion from overtaking the land in one of the greatest RPGs ever from the award-winning Bethesda Game Studios.</p>
<p><strong>Rediscover Cyrodiil</strong></p>
<p>Journey through the rich world of Tamriel and battle across the planes of Oblivion where handcrafted details have been meticulously recreated to ensure each moment of exploration is awe-inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Navigate Your Own Story</strong></p>
<p>From the noble warrior to the sinister assassin, wizened sorcerer, or scrappy blacksmith, forge your path and play the way you want.</p>
<p><strong>Experience an Epic Adventure</strong></p>
<p>Step inside a universe bursting with captivating stories and encounter an unforgettable cast of characters. Master swordcraft and wield powerful magic as you fight to save Tamriel from the Daedric invasion.</p>
<p><strong>The Complete Story</strong></p>
<p>Experience everything Oblivion has to offer with previously released story expansions Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine, and additional downloadable content included in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a huge fan of Skyrim, completing it numerous times, I never was able to get into Oblivion (although it's been a long time since last trying it). Looks like this will be a great time to give it a proper go in completed upgraded form and it does look <em>gorgeous</em>. This doesn't just look like a remaster, it's practically a full remake based on everything they talked about during the livestream announcement.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's a standard edition for £49.99 and a Deluxe Edition for £59.99. The Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Digital base game</li>
<li>Unique digital Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon Armors, Weapons, and Horse Armor Sets</li>
<li>Digital Artbook and Soundtrack App</li>
<li>Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine story expansions</li>
<li>Additional downloadable content: Fighter’s Stronghold expansion, Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair, Mehrune’s Razor, The Thieves Den, Wizard’s Tower, Orrery, and Horse Pack Armor</li>
</ul>

      <title>Civilization VII 1.2 is out with multiplayer teams, the one more turn game mode, new resources and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest update to Sid Meier's Civilization VII from Firaxis Games is out now with version 1.2 bringing some major new features, and a whole lot of enhancements to make this latest game in the series feel just a bit more finished.</p>
<p>With the update they've added in ten new resources to find including Mangoes, Clay, Flax, Rubies, Rice, Limestone, Tin, Llamas, Hardwood, and Wild Game. Each comes with their own effects and narrative event too. Resource distribution is a bit more randomized with new placement login to keep things a bit more interesting too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/279769721745331255gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The One More Turn mode is live, for people who wish to keep on playing after finishing the Modern Age. This lets you experiment a bit more, earn other victory types and see their cinematics too.</p>
<p>Food and population growth also got some developer "TLC", so they overhauled it as they "heard you loud and clear on this one". In short they said the impact with this update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Food-focused strategies are finally viable all game long. </li>
<li>Food-focused civs and leaders like (looking at you, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/pachacuti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Pachacuti</u></a>) will feel stronger and more fun to play.</li>
<li>AI behavior has improved, since they can now leverage high-Food starts and avoid bottlenecks that used to limit their expansion. You may find you even need to turn your difficulty settings down a notch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A major new feature is the addition of Multiplayer Teams. Something that felt odd to be left out really for this type of game. Now you can "play co-op with a friend or have a showdown with multiple teams facing off against each other". Details include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Teams share visibility with each other, along with relationships, war status, and alliance status with other leaders.</li>
<li>When one player wins a victory, the whole team also wins that victory.</li>
<li>Teammates can perform Diplomatic Actions with each other, with the exception of Espionage Actions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it's a bit different to previous Civ games, as you don't share Tech or Civic progress, so your play time is still a bit unique.</p>
<p>There's also lots of other balance improvements, AI upgrades, UI improvements and much more. For Linux players they also "Addressed several input issues" and on Steam Deck they also made a few UI tweaks to improve the flow too. See all in the full <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Expand and rearrange your inventory, watch numbers tick up and break the game in LOOTPLOT</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have no idea what actual genre LOOTPLOT belongs in, or how to properly describe it. You go through rounds of sorting through your inventory and expanding it, trying to create crazy synergies and keep increasing your points needed to beat each level. If you love watching numbers go up constantly, it's definitely for you. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you pick a starting Cat, each with their own different bonuses. There's 12 Cats in it right now, including the tutorial cat. Then the game presents you with a small board of inventory tiles and your starting items. Each round you need to hit a specific amount of points, which you accrue based on your inventory items being activated in a set order from bottom left up to top right.</p>
<p>Positioning all the items is key, as are the slots themselves with lots of different types that have bonuses. You also expand your inventory space with various types of slots as the rounds and levels go on, eventually building up a huge board.</p>

<p>It reminds me in a way of inventory management games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a>, blended with a bit of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/ballionaire-is-annoyingly-good-and-i-want-to-play-it-all-the-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ballionaire</a> for the constant flow of points and general craziness.</p>
<p>The tutorial is a bit deceptive on how easy it is, just to show you how nuts it can end up when you progress through it. The actual main game is a fair bit more challenging to hit the points score needed to complete each level. Still somewhat on the easy side though.</p>
<p>From my time spent with it I can definitely see myself playing endless hours of this, to see just how ridiculous I can get it to be with the points system and see if I can make some crazy loops. A great casual game just to relax with.</p>
<p>The game is currently in Early Access with the developer noting it won't be long before it's finished with them estimating only around 3 months. It has basically everything to be a complete game already, but they plan to add in more items and possibly even a PvE or PvP mode eventually.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Slavic folklore Deathless. Tales of Old Rus improves text sizing on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together a collectible card game, roguelike, and turn-based strategy game Deathless. Tales of Old Rus looks like a must-have for fans of titles like Slay the Spire. Now it should be a better fit on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>The developer just released an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2727210/announcements/detail/518585243118076668" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> that amongst other things, improves the text sizing and layout on Steam Deck or "an enlarged interface on PC". There's various other bug fixes that came with the update.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eZuMIamSZyE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f1bfefd0a12348c90c029eabf4b6f379.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eZuMIamSZyE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reimagined Realms</strong>: The first video game adaptation of the original universe by artist Roman Papsuev and featuring music by acclaimed composer Dmitriy Silantyev. </li>
<li><strong>Fearsome Fairytale Foes: </strong>Clash with revenants and khuds, fight a yaga, chat with a vodyanoy, and even befriend rusalkas… or maybe not — those sneaky water nymphs are deadly foes.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure: </strong>combine, customize, and collect all manner of cards and weaponry, with diversity in the decks per main hero to be modified. </li>
<li><strong>Deal or No Deal</strong>: Unlock new cards and battle modifiers by the end of each playthrough to make your future runs even more exciting, but beware - foes of all sizes can still be a threat even to the most experienced.</li>
<li><strong>A Tale of Four Heroes: </strong>Watch as the heroes’ tales intertwine in surprising ways. Complete quests, meet memorable allies, and confront inimitable foes. Defeating bosses will prove to be quite the challenge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually hadn't even heard of this one until seeing the update today, looks really good and has an overall Very Positive rating from Steam players. For Desktop Linux players it also has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB.</p>

      <title>Starcom: Unknown Space improves the UI and controller support ready for Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starcom: Unknown Space from Wx3 Labs, LLC has a fresh upgrade out now that brings in numerous improvements to the UI and controller support, as the developer hopes to get it Steam Deck Verified. <em>Valve currently have it rated Playable.</em></p>
<p>About it: "Starcom: Unknown Space is an action adventure RPG of space exploration, ship building and fast-paced tactical combat. Enter a vast open-world universe filled with alien factions vying for power, strange worlds to explore, mysteries to investigate, and a sinister enemy that threatens the galaxy with an ancient power."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZBUKGmZo4-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/39c4d31f358286e9a97ed12b9d639090.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZBUKGmZo4-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the game getting a Native Linux version was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/starcom-unknown-space-arrives-in-december-linux-support-a-high-priority/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally</a> a high priority. However, Proton has come a long way, so their updated <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1750770/discussions/0/3497635239410938010/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> notes it's still a goal but not high priority since it works well with Proton.</p>
<p>As for the "Kepler 21530 Controller / Deck Update", the developer said the "main goal of this build was to prepare the game for Steam Deck verification". Here's all the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1750770/view/529844242184405524" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improvements</a> it pulls in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deck/Controller Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Save &amp; Load menus to enable all functionality via controller inputs, including toggling selections for delete, deleting old autosaves, etc.</li>
<li>When text scaling is set to maximum (set by default on the Deck) all text should be a minimum of 9 pixels high at 1280x800 resolution.</li>
<li>Eliminated areas where scaled text overlaps other UI elements.</li>
<li>Dropdowns now keep current selection in view when using controller.</li>
<li>All text input fields should bring up the virtual keyboard on the Deck.</li>
<li>Now possible to toggle highlight, fog in map mode.</li>
<li>Research panel correctly keeps research selection in view.</li>
<li>In cases where there are two scrollviews visible (such as the ship log), right stick scrolls the first, dpad scrolls the second.</li>
<li>Cargo screen allows for quickly analyzing items and proceeding to the next.</li>
<li>Improved input handling in the shipyard.</li>
<li>Chromaplate swatch customization now works with controller.</li>
<li>Crew help should correctly reference controller inputs instead of keyboard if the controller is being used.</li>
</ul>
General fixes:

<ul>
<li>If the player has set a "design goal", the trade screen previously did not show shortfalls in the faction's own reserve currency. Now it does.</li>
<li>Rendering optimization when in map mode.</li>
<li>Several minor typos.</li>
</ul>

      <title>A-RED Walking Robot is a 3D physics puzzle-platformer where you control a wind-up toy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A-RED Walking Robot looks like it could be an interesting puzzle-platformer. You control a wind-up robot toy, tasked with getting through a workshop full of different trials.</p>
<p>There's no release date for it yet, but the developer recently announced Linux support is now available for the Steam Playtest. The developer said it's a "A miniature nerve-wrecking/patience-proving journey where you are granted to fall… a lot". More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pilot A-RED, a charming wind-up robot, as you face the ingenious trials set by its creator in a fascinating workshop full of challenges, surprises, and enemies.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of different physical mechanics and precise control, you must overcome multiple challenges: master balance skills, solve intricate mazes, move objects with your tiny hands, shoot lasers to move obstacles, defeat enemies, use electricity to activate switches, and even fly with your jetpack to cover great distances!<br/>
<br/>
But nobody said it would be easy; A-RED’s vital energy comes from its wind-up mechanism... Can you keep it always running?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a bit of longer early gameplay the developer put up below:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Coming in with the March 27th major <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3372420/announcements/detail/523086487782162770" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> that also added new book storage options, a proper Native Linux version of the game was also added.

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A world of books to explore! - Receive, sort, and organize the greatest classics of world literature the way you prefer! From Shakespeare to Flaubert, including Jules Verne and Machado de Assis: in Libritopia, you'll find all the must-have classics for any library!</li>
<li>Organize the space your way - Name your library, expand its size, and furnish the space! Set up the environment by placing shelves or using furniture to create corridors. Add labels to each shelf to classify books by genre, author, year, country, even color - or any other way you want! It’s YOUR library.</li>
<li>Librarians unite! - Work with friends in multiplayer mode to manage the daily demands of your library. Divide tasks and collaborate to meet all the visitor's needs!</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the visitors! - Ensure all visitors can access the books they want! Manage check-outs and book returns, assist visitors with finding books on the shelves, and make sure your library is a peaceful place. No cell phones allowed! Shhhhhh!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is currently in Early Access with the developer noting it will take around a year to finish it. Currently it's £5.89 / $6.99 / 6,89€ with the developer mentioning they do plan to increase the price as it gets more content and features.</p>

      <title>A retro goodie rebuilt from 1994, Ironseed 25th Anniversary Edition recently added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ironseed from 1994 is not one I'm familiar with, I only know if I had seen it when I was small I probably would have played it for hours. Ironseed 25th Anniversary Edition is a modern 2020 remake and now it has a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: "The player begins with a single ship and a chosen crew. Planets are randomly generated and numerous ship designs and crew selection allow for different playing styles. Technology research, space exploration, resource management and gathering, production, crew management and alien diplomacy are essential elements. New ships, new upgrades, and ancient artifacts help the player in their efforts. Combat can be both in the form of random encounters or planned for by the player. Ironseed has been compared to Star Control, Starflight, Masters of Orion, Space Rangers, and Captain Blood."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g0nAbsOEO6U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ec5b0ad6c131002b2a92f305e23a3a75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g0nAbsOEO6U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1412980/announcements/detail/533220039674824025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> was launched March 28th that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rebuilt application using Unity 6.</li>
<li>Added linux build.</li>
<li>Fixed auroras rendering in wrong layer sometimes.</li>
<li>Fixed Next/Previous buttons in local system display.</li>
<li>Fixed lights in main scene and local system interfering with each other.</li>
<li>Fix selection box texture alpha channel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see retro games getting a new life and on more platforms too!</p>

      <title>New Steam Beta for Desktop / Steam Deck fixes notes and screenshots vanishing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a small update to the Steam Beta Client for Desktop and Steam Deck, containing two fixes that have been confusing players. It may not be a big update, but still an important one.</p>
<p>For the April 21st update in the Beta channel here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where changes to notes could be lost when offline.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where only newly taken screenshots would appear in the screenshot list until client restart.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The screenshot issue was an annoying one, it happened to me a few times when trying to gather shots from my Steam Deck. Nice to see it solved now.</p>

</ul>

<p>Valve have yet to give it a rating but it's nice to see direct testing. That video issue is an odd one though, likely some sort of codec support problem.</p>

      <title>ROCKFISH reducing EVERSPACE 2 DLC pricing as everything is getting more expensive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is nice. With the price of so many things going up everywhere thanks to tariffs, inflation and everything else - ROCKFISH Games have reduced the pricing of the upcoming big EVERSPACE 2 Wrath of the Ancients DLC. <em>They also only just recently reduced the priced of the previous Titans DLC too.</em></p>
<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/524214742651240614" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they developer mentioned "With events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general. You feel it, we feel it, and all those marketing emails we’ve all been hammered with talking about prices going up certainly don’t help." and so they've decided to slash the price of Wrath of the Ancients from $29.99 down to "$24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99 / ¥2970 (other regional pricing will be in line with Steam guidelines)".</p>
<p>They said that no content has been cut from the upcoming DLC, and they're in the middle of polishing it up ready for the May 12th release date.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Not heard of it before? More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Never Split the Party is an ultra social rogue-like!</strong> You're <strong>one of four adventurers</strong> entering an epic dungeon to take down the evil vampire known only as <strong>The Countess</strong>, who killed your parents and is now constantly bombarding you with insults.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Explore</strong> a procedurally generated dungeon, <strong>amass</strong> powerful upgrades, and <strong>cooperate</strong> with your fellow adventures to <strong>conquer</strong> and <strong>crush</strong> the vile dungeon bosses!<br/>
<br/>
Never Split the Party has over <strong>120</strong> upgrades, <strong>21</strong> magical potions, <strong>28</strong> unique enemies, and over <strong>425</strong> room designs spread among <strong>5</strong> procedurally generated dungeon levels for maximum replayability!</p>

<p>The latest update brings in a whole new lighting system to the game to bring Dynamic illumination from enemies, fireballs, and magical effects. There's also Lightable Lanterns that react when you set them on fire and Atmospheric glow effects that enhance the fantasy experience.</p>
<p>Not just that though they've also overhauled the networking so you can say "goodbye to connection frustrations". Improved Steam Deck support too, since a keyboard is no longer required. Amongst many other additional enhancements - it's a massive update to the game.</p>

      <title>Supernatural school-life tactics RPG Demonschool set to release in Q3 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're finally getting close to Demonschool actually releasing, with it now having a Q3 2025 release window so it will be here before the end of September.</p>
<p>In Demonschool you will hunt gruesome devils and bosses inspired by '60s and '70s Italian horror cinema and Japanese horror manga as 2D and 3D realms clash, washed in the fluorescent hues of JRPG giants like Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. Master a chess-like tactical board inspired by Into the Breach and form strategies to take down Hell’s deadliest creatures.</p>
<p>Latest trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QasyHgjha2I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dbdf6321f1bcb2932082b58a41e7385.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QasyHgjha2I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“After a few delays, we have finally shaped Demonschool into the game we set out to create,” said Brandon Sheffield, creative director of Necrosoft Games. “We’d like to thank our audience for supporting us through the development process and can’t wait for them to fish out every little detail the island has to offer.”</p>
<p>At release it will have Native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>

      <title>Snailshock is Pool but with Snails, with Dice for extra moves and Cards to mess with them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your weird and quirky indie games? You'll want to check out Snailshock Grand Supreme Tournament, which answers a question no one asked - what if Pool but Snails?</p>
<p>You get to play through a full campaign of various different versus battles, with you playing the classic game of Pool. Okay, not quite the classic game of Pool, since the balls are all <em>Snails</em>. The basics are basically the same though. Shoot the White cue snail ball into the others to attempt to pot your colour. If you pot your colour, the opponent's health goes down.</p>
<p>You can roll the dice to add some extra movements to either your colour or the opponent's and there's various cards you can also use to mess with individual snails, like powering up a snail ball for some extra movement, make one half the size for a few rounds, turn another into the cue ball and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pvQr9K4yKI0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac67219f19df2c8e4ab79919b000f6f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pvQr9K4yKI0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really clever weird spin on Pool. Love it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://oroshibu.itch.io/snailshock-grand-supreme" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">check it out on itch.io</a>. It has a Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>Monument Valley 1 and 2 get full controller support which should get them Steam Deck Verified soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer ustwo games just upgraded both Monument Valley: Panoramic Edition and Monument Valley 2: Panoramic Edition with full controller support which should get them bumped up to Steam Deck Verified status.</p>
<p>Both games are currently rated Steam Deck Playable, with the only issue on both had Valve note how they don't show the correct keybinds. Now they will, so I expect both to get re-tested and set as Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>They're incredibly highly rated, initially mobile games that eventually got an expanded PC release back in 2022. A third game, Monument Valley 3, is scheduled to get a PC release eventually with a Steam page live but no release date listed.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Zero Company is a Clone Wars XCOM and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a huge fan of XCOM including the classics and modern versions, and a big Star Wars fan, the recent STAR WARS Zero Company announcement has me terribly excited. Not only does it look and sound XCOM, it's also made by some of the people who were involved with it. The developer, Bit Reactor, has some of the minds behind XCOM, Civilization, Gears of War, Elder Scrolls Online, and more.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,” said Greg Foertsch, CEO and Creative Director at Bit Reactor. “It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12430030111745226678gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>“At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” said Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP, Lucasfilm Games. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rcxnRaZ6slU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b53f12176b6af6d079214995fe1244ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In Star Wars Zero Company, players will embark on a campaign of tactical operations and investigations across the galaxy. Between missions, they will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Company’s adversaries. Players will have the freedom to create and customize their own squad of recruited operators while getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>Hopefully there won't be any problems playing this with Proton. Since it's a single-player game, I also hope EA have learned some lessons from previous games not to force the EA app on it.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is a tank-battling destructive MOBA that will have Steam Deck support </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is an upcoming MOBA from Clay Token Game Studio, Inc. that might actually manage to pull in some players where others have failed, thanks to the vehicle combat and grand scale compared with other games.</p>
<p>Here it's 5 versus 5 but with two major differences. You control a special tank in twin-stick styled controls instead of a humanoid character, and you'll be battling through multiple lanes that have over 100 "minions" to blast through. They said it "combines traditional lane-based mechanics with a tactical warzone feel". Oh, and the map is destructible too. Buildings and walls can be destroyed to forge a new path between lanes, <em>I think this sounds awesome.</em></p>
<p>They've <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3199180/announcements/detail/498319044783374736" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> their full support for the Steam Deck noting that they're "currently in the process of intense testing and optimization to ensure the game runs smoothly on handheld devices, both technically and in terms of gameplay". They're working on getting in Steam Deck Verified, with their demo build "currently running at around 60 FPS in internal tests" which is very promising.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1k24suf/were_planning_a_native_linux_release_for_our/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they're also asking if people want a Native Linux version of it, otherwise it will run with Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kx-u_InH0SY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65d0ead0be6490c85135f6e9590895a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kx-u_InH0SY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The trailer sold me pretty quickly. I just hope their monetisation of it is fair as it seems it will be free to play. </p>

      <title>Ubuntu 25.04 upgrades halted due to Kubuntu users getting a broken desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of a major woopsie. The upgrade path for the latest Ubuntu 25.04 release has been pulled offline, as it has resulted in Kubuntu users seeing a broken desktop.</p>
<p>What you end up with is a weird looking login screen, and nothing seems to work. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19134569061744989712gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Picture credit: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dimspace.xyz/post/3ln3mizqzrc2q" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@dimspace.xyz</a> on Bluesky</em></p>
<p>I actually <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/liamd.gamingonlinux.com/post/3llgrewoaqk26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">encountered</a> this bug during the Beta, thinking I had done something wrong or not paid enough attention. Turns out, it was a real genuine <em>major</em> bug. I probably should have reported it, but I'm always doing multiple things at the same time and quite overworked right now. So, uh, feel free to blame me I guess? Developers can't fix stuff they don't know about — woops.</p>
<p>Writing on Reddit in replies to posts about the problem, Simon Quigley the Lubuntu Release Manager, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kubuntu/comments/1k1ncaf/comment/mnoo753/?context=3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's what's going on with this, because yeah, there's something going on.</p>
<p>It's my fault personally, sorry folks.</p>
<p>So, when you go to upgrade from Kubuntu 24.10 to 25.04, the actual installer is grabbed as a tarball from the archive.</p>
<p>In other words, Kubuntu 25.04's upgrader is used to upgrade to 25.04, from 24.10.</p>
<p>Well, I ported it to PyQt6 this cycle. A few weeks before release, I was pinged with someone notifying me that Kubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Lubuntu didn't actually come with pyqt6 installed.</p>
<p>Literally, installing pyqt6 should fix your issue, for now. If you run into actual issues with the Kubuntu install after upgrade, I'm much more concerned.</p>
<p>We have a fix, in the queue. Waiting. Sitting. We had the release today. I'm surprised people are able to upgrade already, and if someone already enabled the upgrades without checking with me... I'm going to be unhappy, to say the least.</p>
<p>Some cross training is happening, we're working it out. For now, this was me, sorry about that folks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then in a follow-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kubuntu/comments/1k1ncaf/comment/mnq4pox/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, just a quick update on the latest.</p>
<p>Yes, 25.04 upgrades are broken beyond just adding pyqt6 as a dependency. While I had something to do with it, there's a much greater issue at play that we don't know about yet.</p>
<p>From everything I can possibly read, enabling upgrades this early was a genuine mistake not found in code review. I have done everything in my power to slam the brakes on the upgrades, not just for Kubuntu, but for everyone. All ten flavors, plus Desktop, and Server.</p>
<p>Yes, I personally pushed the code change disabling those upgrades. It required one more manual step, and now it's deployed.</p>
<p>As of about 20 minutes ago, I've passed off to the official Ubuntu Release Team who will now drive this to completion. The change I made was to mark Plucky as unsupported temporarily, which will halt the upgrades, with a POSSIBLE side effect of an end of life popup, on your Plucky machine.</p>
<p>Ignore the popup, it was just the quickest solution to throw a wrench in the gears.</p>
<p>I'm genuinely sorry about this. On behalf of Ubuntu, on behalf of Kubuntu, and on behalf of my own flavor, Lubuntu. This is unacceptable, and I will be persistent in making sure our processes become better.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to go to sleep now. This thread is what alerted me that there's a wider issue, specifically. So, thank you all.</p>
<p>We'll be better. If you need help picking up the pieces, yes, we have support channels for basically everything. The best thing is to just make sure the kubuntu-desktop package is already installed.</p>
<p>I hope you can also understand my position. I have never worked for Canonical, I work for Altispeed Technologies. Please go support the Ask Noah Show, Noah is the one who made sure I had enough coffee to survive this thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accidents and bugs happen, hopefully some lessons will be learned from all sides on this. Just goes to show, Beta releases are vital to pick up bugs…if they're reported.</p>

      <title>Peaceful nature simulation city-builder Of life and Land launches May 16</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Of life and Land has been in Early Access for just over a year now, and it's about to cross over the finishing line as Metaroot and Kerzoven have announced the 1.0 launch for May 16th.</p>
<p>More about it: Of Life and Land is a charming settlement-building strategy game paired with a rich nature simulation experience. Every animal and plant strives to find its place in nature while you lead your villagers to their future. Expand to different regions and trade with local factions to gain needed resources.</p>
<p>The 1.0 Release introduces a brand-new historical scenario about the Counts of Lenzburg, set in the Central Plateau of medieval Switzerland. Players can build the Lenzburg Castle, discover ancient myths, and take part in a time of political conflict between church and empire. New features also include castle construction, single-city scenarios, advanced trade mechanics, and decorative elements like benches, signposts, and flower boxes to bring settlements to life.</p>

<p>There's been a lot of updates to it since the initial Early Access release including dirt and humidity simulation, more animals, a simulated education and retirement system, new buildings and much more.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Witch Beam the creators of Unpacking have released the musical puzzler Tempopo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tempopo is the latest release from Australian developer Witch Beam, the creators of Unpacking and Assault Android Cactus. It's out now with Native Linux support!</p>
<p>More about it: "Displaced by a great storm, Hana’s magical musical flowers have found themselves scattered across a series of puzzling sky islands - and only you can help bring them safely home! Your helpers are the Tempopo: incredibly cute creatures who are also extremely chaotic and uncoordinated by nature. Luckily they take direction really well, so with a flick of your conductor's baton, you’ll be able to get them on beat in no time!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xPftQ5Yozks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/058590f60cda9ffff45dafbe8641241e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xPftQ5Yozks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plot Your Path: </strong>Carefully plot the Tempopo’s path through each puzzle, helping them work together to use items and interact with the island map to safely reach the island's end. </li>
<li><strong>A Puzzler’s Paradise:</strong> Each puzzle is an exercise in trial and error, as you experiment with different placements and routes. But don’t worry, Hana is always on hand to give a helpful hint to anyone who needs it! Bonus challenge levels add a <em><strong>huge </strong></em>chunk of extra puzzling outside the main levels for those seeking a bit more difficulty too. </li>
<li><strong>Plot Your Garden:</strong> As you puzzle across all four seasons rescuing Hana’s magical flowers, you’ll replant them back in her musical garden. </li>
<li><strong>Nature’s Orchestra:</strong> Each flower plays a note based on where they’re placed, and you can even stack multiple flowers into the same spot to create chords. As you progress, you’ll collect a whole variety of different sounds to add to the melody - horns, harps and more! Get lost in the rhythm of making new tunes, or trying to recreate your favourites! </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A word from the developer: "Creating Tempopo led to the journey of a lifetime," said Sanatana Mishra, Director of Tempopo and co-founder of Witch Beam. "We've seen everything from a young woman in Melbourne being inspired to create her own games, to an older man in Kyoto giving himself a silent yet forceful fist pump as he rescued a particularly difficult flower. I hope the finished game can surprise and delight those players in ways they couldn't imagine."</p>

      <title>DOOM (2016) gets a surprise release on GOG with a big discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DRM freedom from hell. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_2016" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DOOM (2016)</a> has just released on GOG and there's a nice big discount to go along with the release. However, it's single-player only though.</p>
<p>It's 80% off until May 2nd so this is a great chance to get it. You can play GOG games easily on Linux / Steam Deck with the likes of Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uyT4G2oYtZQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc37fb0b66e762c795c344a7e792dc3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uyT4G2oYtZQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Not that it needs any introduction, but taken from the GOG page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by id software, the studio that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and created multiplayer Deathmatch, DOOM returns as a brutally fun and challenging modern-day shooter experience. Relentless demons, impossibly destructive guns, and fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense, first-person combat.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>You’ve come here for a reason. The Union Aerospace Corporation’s massive research facility on Mars is overwhelmed by fierce and powerful demons, and only one person stands between their world and ours. As the lone DOOM Marine, you’ve been activated to do one thing – kill them all.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A Relentless Campaign</strong></p>
<p>There is no taking cover or stopping to regenerate health as you beat back Hell’s raging demon hordes. Combine your arsenal of futuristic and iconic guns, upgrades, movement and an advanced melee system to knock-down, slash, stomp, crush, and blow apart demons in creative and violent ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really is nice to see some bigger releases come to GOG. Hopefully more will come later like DOOM Eternal too.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 25.04 &#39;Plucky Puffin&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 18/04/25 16:28 BST</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ubuntu-25-04-upgrades-halted-due-to-kubuntu-users-getting-a-broken-desktop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upgrades have been halted due to a major bug</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Canonical has today released Ubuntu 25.04, codenamed "Plucky Puffin", their latest feature upgrade release to one of the most popular Linux distributions. This also includes updates for all the other editions like Kubuntu. It will be supported for 9 months until January 2026 as this is not a long term support release.</p>
<p>This release has been dedicated to Steve Langasek, who sadly passed away January 1st. As said in the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subscribers to the <em>ubuntu-{devel-}announce</em> mailing list and long term participants in the Ubuntu community will have come across Steve Langasek’s work. Steve, known in the community as vorlon, was a long-term member of the Release team (along with being a member of Archive Admin, Techboard, SRU team, and so on) and a colleague to many of us at Canonical. As a member of the Release team, Steve was responsible for devising many of the processes, policies, and tools which we use today, and teaching his fellow members the ropes. <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/remembering-and-thanking-steve-langasek/52665" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steve passed away on 1st January 2025</a> after being unwell for quite some time. The Ubuntu Release Team dedicates 25.04 “Plucky Puffin” to our colleague and friend, Steve Langasek. He is missed and will live in our hearts forever. Thank you for everything, Steve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been running Kubuntu 25.04, since I prefer KDE Plasma, since the Beta release and it has been really smooth. Overall very happy with it as my main choice for my desktop workstation and gaming PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8906297911744913818gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8906297911744913818gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 25.04</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of upgrades in this one including Linux kernel 6.14, which includes the new NTSYNC driver for Wine / Proton. Although <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">don't get too excited</a> about it increasing Windows game performance. There's also the new ARM64 Desktop Image, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/gnome-48-released-with-notification-stacking-performance-improvements-and-initial-hdr-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 48</a> and lots of assorted software upgrades. For gamers on NVIDIA GPU laptops, you'll be hopefully pleased with NVIDIA Dynamic Boost being enabled by default which should give a bit more performance. Plus there's also support for newer Intel GPUs along with Mesa 25.0.</p>
<p>Installation and upgrades should be easier too. The installer added the option to replace an existing Ubuntu install, and there's better support for dual booting with Windows with BitLocker.</p>

      <title>Grab some great stuff for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming for April 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the new up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for April 17th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on.

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered v1.2 fixes &#34;excessive jitter&#34; with Frame Generation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered has been updated with another major patch version 1.2, which brings quite a few essential fixes along with a performance improvement for players on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So far the PC release seems to have been quite well received overall. It's Steam Deck Verified, with many players reporting it does work surprisingly well. It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam. Seems like overall that Nixxes and Naughty Dog have done great with it, a pretty stark comparison to all the issues when the first came to PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1488504191744909984gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Release Notes - 1.2.10416.0553</h4>
<ul>
<li>Addressed a bug where players were unable to fire weapons on the first mouse click, after using the mouse to restart a checkpoint.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would automatically fire their weapon, when aiming after a stealth kill, if the Reload/Quick Throw/Use action was mapped to [R].</li>
<li>Enabling NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation in the launcher now increases the frame rate by the same amount as enabling it in the in-game Display menu.</li>
<li>Addressed an issue where completing a No Return Challenge would not reward the player with the associated weapon skin.</li>
<li>Refracted light in the aquarium is no longer affected by high frame rates, preventing it from being distracting and overly flashy.</li>
<li>Resolved shadow pop-in issues on the side of a building and flickering in a blood stain on the floor of a building in the Capitol Hill area.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when loading into a cutscene with a wide Field of View setting.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that could cause Direct3D Invalid Call crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused some username text on No Return leaderboards to appear as question marks.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that could cause dark lines to appear in volumetric fog during camera movement on ultrawide aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Updated AMD FidelityFx to version 1.1.3 and resolved excessive jitter on Steam Deck when FSR Frame Generation is enabled.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where pressing 'Reset to Default' in the Graphics menu would cause the preset to incorrectly appear as 'Custom'.</li>
<li>Various fixes for visual bugs in ultrawide cinematics.</li>
<li>Various stability improvements.</li>
<li>Various localization fixes.</li>
<li>Various UI bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stress-testing and hardware monitoring tool OCCT has officially released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more apps like this arrive with official Linux support! OCCT for Linux is here and out of Beta testing bringing a full stress-testing and hardware monitoring suite.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the announcement they said the Linux version can do basically everything the Windows version can:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive Stress Tests – Evaluate CPU, GPU, and memory performance under heavy workloads to ensure the stability and reliability of your system.</li>
<li>Advanced Monitoring Tools – Get real-time insights about temperature, voltage, power consumption, and other critical system metrics.</li>
<li>Multi-Platform Support – Compatible with major Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Redhat, Arch Linux, and many more.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface – A streamlined and intuitive UI accessible to all users.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only the start though, as they said they will "keep enhancing OCCT's monitoring capabilities on Linux" although it's already "fully polished". Next up their priority is to provide the "highly anticipated SSD testing feature".</p>

      <title>Arcade-inspired rally-driving experience #DRIVE Rally 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the hashtag that is actually part of the name, #DRIVE Rally has properly launched out of Early Access with the 1.0 release now available. It arrives with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>During Early Access the game managed to hit a Very Positive rating from Steam players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s9xK8RjQxC8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/614d46b379150a7c37843e2b9e23869a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s9xK8RjQxC8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Another special stage in the development of #DRIVE Rally is behind us. Now is definitely the perfect moment to pop the champagne. However, this doesn't mean we're going to slow down! We hope that with the launch of the full version, more players will join our community and the number of gamers who love classic rally racing as much as we do will grow. As a team, we wish you an adrenaline-fueled, thrilling experience, and we're excited to hear from you about your impressions, so we can continue fine-tuning the game post-launch. We are also still working on console versions, which we hope to release later this year." — Dariusz Pietrala, Game Director w Pixel Perfect Dude.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Easy to learn, hard to master – a simple and intuitive driving model that beginners will handle with ease. However, challenging trials await those who know well the sound of gravel under their tires. It's a system designed to highlight the best aspects of racing games.</li>
<li>Drive your way – classic championships, free roam, or party mode allowing for up to 12 players to compete? #DRIVE Rally offers a variety of ways to enjoy the journey ahead.</li>
<li>New horizons, new challenges! – over 600 km of rally stages across 6 diverse locations, all to be explored and challenged in 22 unique cars with full controller and wheel support, as well as compatibility with Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Left three, right one, keep it steady! – the co-driver can be the most loyal fan or the sternest judge. Enjoy victories together, but be prepared for criticism after losses.</li>
<li>Win with style – take the wheel of cars like Das Holzwagen, The Doggo, or The Bobond, inspired by legendary rally machines, and then customize them to perfectly match your driving style. #DRIVE Rally combines 90s nostalgia with modern tuning options.</li>
<li>Postcards from rallies – compete in a racing game world like never before. Get creative and capture your best moments in #DRIVE Rally with the special photo mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently the Linux version is only on Steam.</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite Linux 42 brings Beta support for the MSI Claw handhelds and lots of other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Building on top of the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42 release</a>, Bazzite 42 is out now for this increasingly popular SteamOS-like option to put on your handhelds, desktops and more.</p>
<p>The project continues to grow quite nicely too, and they've shared another snapshot of recent statistics that show Bazzite as having around 29.5K active users as of April. Which is up from the 26.3K they showed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steamos-like-bazzite-linux-has-some-nice-growth-thanks-to-great-handheld-pc-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17636506341744881309gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17636506341744881309gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As for what's new with Bazzite 42 there's of course all the enhancements from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42</a> along with Beta support for the MSI Claw handhelds, there's improved HDR for both GNOME and KDE too along with "various improvements throughout the project". Another nice adjustment is improved HTPC support (Home Theater PC) with a patch for Steam's audio output resetting so it should now stick to what you set.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some future plans were also outlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our team is working with the folks at Fyra Labs (Ultramarine Linux) on a new Live ISO experience that may come to Bazzite in the future and a new Flatpak store is on the way to replace the aging Discover/Software thanks to Glorious Eggroll. Additionally, Yafti is being replaced with a modern and better first-run installer as soon as possible, and we’ll continue to work on expanding to new handhelds. As always if you want to come join us everything here is built in GitHub. We’d love the additional support!</p>

      <title>Moonsigil Atlas is a deckbuilding roguelike with tile-based energy that&#39;s Tetris meets Slay The Spire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this blending of ideas looks damn cool. Moonsigil Atlas looks like it really warps deckbuilders into something quite unique, and I can't wait to check this one out. The developer said it's basically Tetris meets Slay the Spire, and as far as comparisons go it's quite a fun hook to think on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2503700591744819790gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2503700591744819790gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here you play your cards by positioning special magic sigils on the big crescent moon, playing as many as you can that you have the space to fit in. The game will have multiple characters to play as, along with hundreds of cards for a whole lot of possible decks to build.</p>
<p>Depending on where you place your sigils you might get bonuses for adjacency, overlap, and more. With some persisting between turns, or with ongoing effects, and enemies to face that can cast their own hostile sigils to mess with you too. </p>
<p>I really do love the style of this one. Check out their announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590810/Moonsigil_Atlas_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam demo page</a> live for you to follow now too and the game will have Native Linux support. High up on my wishlist this goes!</p>

      <title>Horripilant is a chilling incremental dungeon crawl through the horrors of a forgotten underworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pas Game Studio recently revealed the freaky looking Horripilant. A game that combines elements of an idler, puzzle and autobattler that sees you fight, mine, and think your way through the depths of a forsaken dungeon. Probably one of the most unique looking dungeon crawlers I've ever seen.</p>
<p>It looks wild, and it's currently going through Beta testing, with a Native Linux build being put up, and the they showed it running on a Steam Deck on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/traz.bsky.social/post/3lmwtv2hhgk2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzHhzFOaIyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce75adfa576bd4c9ff55cd25f896ab2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzHhzFOaIyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Story</p>
<p>You awaken. An old, battered knight, lost in the darkest corners of an abandoned dungeon, with no memory of how you got there. The stench of decay permeates the thick air. The walls seem to whisper your name.</p>
<p>As you stir, a strange tree sprout catches your eye. You hit it, for the voice demands it of you; a twig breaks off onto the ground. With your newfound resource, you seem to be able to ameliorate your equipment. Distorted moans echo from an empty staircase. The voice calls to you again, beckoning you. You must go down. It is your purpose...</p>
<p>Encounter bizarre characters, solve cryptic puzzles, and survive the horrors that lurk in every shadow. Will you escape this living nightmare, or will it consume you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Incrementally gain and collect materials.</li>
<li>Combat horrific foes in the dungeon.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and explore the depths of your camp.</li>
<li>Upgrade your gear to venture deeper.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meet god and gain strong boons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat, adapt, and survive. The depths need you, and you need it.</p>
