      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The much loved Dwarf Fortress just got another small update to fix up some issues, and an exciting preview teaser of the upcoming Siege Update.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/528732929177683220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> their publisher noted how the developers are "busily finishing the last few features before the siege update is ready to go live". Until then, a small update was released with the improvements listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash caused by interrogating certain suspects under certain circumstances in world generation.</li>
<li>Fixed crash in legends caused by missing works of art.</li>
<li>Fixed potential out of bounds crash setting appearance contributions from parents in world generation.</li>
<li>Fixed pathing issues caused by building construction on certain maps.</li>
<li>Fixed some other issues related to map block allocation and path connectivity.</li>
<li>Made training marksdwarves use the last bolt in a stack.</li>
<li>Allowed work orders to specific plants for milling jobs.</li>
<li>Stopped dyed items from triggering inappropriate export prohibitions.</li>
<li>Specifying wood in certain work quotas will now actually use the specified wood.</li>
<li>Stopped meandering behavior for animals that are trained for war or hunting.</li>
<li>Again allowed impaled weapons to be dropped by the wielder, leaving the item behind.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem causing minerals to not show up in some mods.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with blinding and necrosis item powers in scripts.</li>
<li>Increased world generation stability.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with material initialization causing unpredictable problems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the Siege Update, a short teaser was shared which they said showed off the likes of "new sprites with trolls wearing equipment, showing a enemy siege formation" and "a defensive formation with crossbow turrets firing at an incoming charge up a hill" which is just small sample of stuff you'll be able to do when the update goes live which will be sometime "soon",</p>

<p>On top of all that, they announced the first official Dwarf Fortress mod jam. A three day event that's beginner friendly to get more people modding Dwarf Fortress. The jam will take place October 20-23rd with a showcase stream to show some entries off on October 29th.</p>

      <title>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion gets a demo with Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is an upcoming retro-styled beat 'em up from Tribute Games with Dotemu and Gamirror Games. A demo was just released with Linux support.</p>
<p>Tribute Games have previously worked on a number of Native Linux games including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge and they're also doing the upcoming Scott Pilgrim EX. So it's nice to see direct support continue for MARVEL Cosmic Invasion too!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IYxemvK0fEI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e4a07b1ecece2fa1071983f53142919.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IYxemvK0fEI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo features 9 playable heroes including Nova, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Phyla-Vell, Captain America, Storm, Venom, She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon. There's 2 playable levels in it with New York City and a Helicarrier, plus you can play it in local or online multiplayer too.</p>
<p>The full game will have 15 playable heroes, so this is just a taste of what is to come. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, the immortal Super Villain Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, threatening all life as we know it. Super Heroes, both Earth-born and cosmic, must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</p>
<p>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar power-ups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the MARVEL universe. MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or Super Villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</p>

      <title>Grounded 2 gets a major update and brings some Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grounded 2 from Obsidian Entertainment and Eidos-Montréal recently had quite a big upgrade, and now it should work better on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Named the "Hairy and Scary Update" it brings with it AXL, the Colossal Tarantula, which is incredibly creepy. A better building system has been added in too with a grid system to make snapping all your stuff together easier than ever. There's also upgrades to the buggy, new buildings, support for Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese, a new Praying Mantis Armour set and other assorted general improvements.</p>
<p>Specifically for the Steam Deck they noted they "Fixed an issue where Grounded 2 did not launch properly on Steam Deck" and "Tweaked Steam Deck Settings with the updated Graphics Options in the settings".</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer below:</p>

      <title>Below the Crown from the developer of Duskers arrives November with a demo live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Misfits Attic developers of the excellent Duskers have revealed their quirky blend of genres in Below the Crown will hit Early Access on November 10th. It's a love letter to chess, roguelikes, and dungeon crawlers with a demo that should be live today.</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux their press team noted "For transparency, I know Linux support is planned, but we're unsure when it will be available at this time". So initially you may need to use Proton to run the Windows version.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Covet great riches and please the Emperor by engaging in a satisfying mix of chess, spell slinging, and strategy. As a Wizard, lead a party of chess-inspired pieces, including Bishops, Knights, perhaps even a Mad Queen, to brave a mysterious, ever-changing dungeon.</p>
<p>Outwit the enemy with superior strategic maneuvers, or wing it by flinging freezing spells and explosions. Collect and assign magical runes to increase the challenge level of the next run. Acquire new skills and spell cards to expand the tactical possibilities, as well as the fun.</p>
<p>Connect with the community by competing in challenges, creating and sharing custom boards, and watching repays of other Wizard’s high scores. Post epic victories for all to admire, and answer glitchy psychological evaluations to uncover what’s really going on below the crown. Don’t worry, just answer honestly, and move on with more badass wizard shenanigans.</p>
<p>Engage in an approachable and dynamic experience that honors the dynamism of chess, now with a magical, dark ‘80s sci-fi twist. Below the Crown was created by industry veterans who have worked on everything from well-known series Diablo and Call of Duty to DreamWorks classics, including Shrek 2, How to Train Your Dragon, and Bee Movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Below the Crown was ultimately born out of our love for chess and fun, strategic gameplay," said Tim Keenan, Founder, Misfits Attic. “Executing very complex, multistage moves is the best part of the game for some, but can be intimidating for others. By creating an atmospheric and escalating romp through the depths below, we hope to create an experience that both types of players can enjoy."</p>
<p>They also released a first proper gameplay trailer recently too you can watch below:</p>

      <title>Cinematic puzzle-platforming adventure LIFTED gets a new trailer and demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the mind of former Disney Imagineer Jeffrey Ashbrook and his company Adventure Works, LIFTED looks gorgeous and a lot of fun in the new footage and demo.</p>
<p>The game was previously called Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator, looks like it was renamed back in May (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2184020/history/?changeid=U:62255261" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). While this new name is easier to remember, it's a lot more generic and boring. At least the gameplay seems like it's still just as great looking.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the inquisitive shoes of Ari Buktu, a cool and curious lad simply looking for some extra credit in Professor Lionel Raventhorpe’s science class. Witness the unlikely pair travel through history in an immersive journey full of heart, humor, and imagination. Platform through ancient Egypt and Mayan ruins to find a beautiful tiara for the Professor’s lady love. Evade pirates, solve perplexing puzzles, and beat history’s most notorious troublemakers to the treasure."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vc3EsJ0odD4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a913085ef8356a93de62fee7ced82fb9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vc3EsJ0odD4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full game releases sometime in Q1 2026. It has a Native Linux version and they said it's "Perfect for STEAM DECK".</p>

      <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming will get a refresh with a new social game system - and an AI powered game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon have announced a bit of a refresh is coming to their cloud gaming service Amazon Luna, with new games and new ways to play.</p>
<p>From the announcement they said at some point later this year (they didn't specify) you'll see a "completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna that combines innovative social party games with amazing blockbusters to make every night in your house the perfect game night to share with your family and friends".</p>
<p>The new additions will be included in Amazon Prime subscriptions at no additional cost. This includes "GameNight", a new social play system that doesn't need a controller, you can use a smartphone with games designed around the living room TV with people able to join by a QR code. It all sounds a bit similar to what Jackbox Games do with their party packs. </p>
<p>GameNight will arrive with a collection of social party games that will be added to the service including more than 25 multiplayer games that include "GameNight-optimized takes on favorites like Angry Birds, Draw &amp; Guess, Exploding Kittens and Flappy Golf Party, to party‑ready adaptations of board game hits such as Taboo, Ticket to Ride and Clue".</p>
<p>However, they're also jumping in with more AI generation. One of these games is called Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg which they say is "human‑built" that's an "AI‑powered improv courtroom game where players invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ajawdjs6KKA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/719238d06642e6f3daaf9af9867228ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ajawdjs6KKA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also announced a further expansion for traditional gaming. So for those of you who prefer bigger more normal gaming, there's something in the announcement for you too.</p>
<p>With this "all-new" Luna will it have "a diverse and growing library of more than 50 popular, classic, indie, and blockbuster games" including the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, and TopSpin 2K25, Dave the Diver, MotoGP 25, Farming Simulator 22, and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom amongst others like EA SPORTS FC 25, LEGO DC Super-Villains, Team Sonic Racing, and Batman: Arkham Knight.</p>

      <title>Bloober Team announce a Native Steam Deck release for Cronos: The New Dawn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest survival horror from Bloober Team that arrived September 5th, and they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2101960/view/498333631688737999" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a Native Steam Deck release.</p>
<p>This is a little bit confusing though as they <em>already</em> had a Native Linux version at release. The Steam Deck uses SteamOS (Linux), and so it did already have a Native version available. They don't go into <em>any</em> details on what has specifically now been tweaked for the Steam Deck. The announcement simply said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At launch, Cronos arrived as our latest survival horror title with full Steam Deck verification—but that’s not all!</p>
<p>Today, we’ve released a native build of the game for Steam’s handheld console, which means even better performance on this platform.</p>
<p>Enjoy Cronos on Steam, wherever you are!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve have also already changed the defaults to use the Native Linux version, where previously it used Proton to run the Windows version. It's possible with the change to the Steam Deck default, they just mean that and they're hyping it up, but without any details it's difficult to tell.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Bloober to see if they could clarify what's changed and improved.</p>
<p>Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2101960/depots/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there is still the normal Native Linux content depot along with a content depot tagged for the Steam Deck now too. So hopefully this won't cause any issues with downloading it on Desktop Linux PCs<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-native-linux-version-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> like we saw with the Native Linux version of Baldur's Gate 3 for Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e5xqIwEAJKs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57e0a3894f1f67d09e5a018786fb988c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e5xqIwEAJKs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.</p>
<p>Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.</p>
<p>In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.</p>
<p>You are a Traveler working for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport you to 1980s-era Poland.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena game engine remake OpenTESArena adds Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While OpenTESArena is still a work in progress to bring The Elder Scrolls: Arena up to modern standards, it's looking even better with the 0.17.0 update.</p>
<p>According to the developer the current status is: "Player movement is nearly feature-complete - currently you can jump, climb out of chasms, and swim, but stairsteps are unsolved. Enemies can be killed but their AI is not yet implemented. Items in containers can be picked up and found in the player's inventory but cannot be equipped yet. All world map locations are implemented and the player can fast travel to them. Citizens wander around and have their names generated but conversations are not yet implemented. Character creation is mostly implemented except for class generation questions". You can see the current <a href="https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena/wiki#roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for what's planned across the next few releases.</p>

<p>For this release here's some of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vulkan renderer:
	<ul>
<li>Must enable manually in options menu by setting Graphics API to Vulkan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mesh combining.</li>
<li>Changed forward lighting to tiled forward.</li>
<li>Added classic heavy fog effect.</li>
<li>Added floating origin to reduce Z-fighting and shimmering.</li>
<li>Added tavern patron dialogue.</li>
<li>Increased physics updates per frame to reduce bumpy feeling when moving.</li>
<li>Added baseline .OBJ file format support, used with voxels.</li>
<li>Added inverted mouselook option.</li>
<li>Added Enable Validation Layers option (must have Vulkan validation layers installed).</li>
<li>Improved frame pacing.</li>
<li>Improved high DPI support.</li>
<li>Reduced sky mesh vertices.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced player and citizen move speed.</li>
<li>Updated SDL to 2.0.12.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Class-based co-op zombie shooter Projekt Z: Beyond Order gets a new trailer - plans a 2026 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Projekt Z: Beyond Order is a promising looking upcoming class-based co-op zombie shooter from 314 Arts and we have a fresh short look at it. As far as we know they still plan Linux support which they confirmed to GamingOnLinux multiple times previously.</p>
<p>Inspired by Left 4 Dead, they're hoping to blend "the casual and the hardcore market by implementing a bit of both" they said in an email.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience the intense action of battling the undead in Projekt Z: Beyond Order, a thrilling first-person zombie shooter with robust character progression and extensive weapon customization. Set around World War II, take on fast-paced missions or explore the terrifying island during expeditions as one of four survivors, each with their own unique abilities and role in 4-player co-op. Shoot, loot, craft, survive."</p>
<p>New trailer below:</p>

<p>I missed it but they also announced back in August that they've moved the release date to sometime in 2026, with no firm date set now. Will keep you posted when I hear more.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic will get an open Beta on October 13 during Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 Classic is an upcoming mod for Valve's shooter that aims to re-imagine the launch era of the original game and you'll be able to try it soon. Upcoming in the sense of the Steam release that is, as it was originally launched sometime back in 2014.</p>
<p>On Steam the team behind it <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3545060/announcements/detail/525355229451911904" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that for Steam Next Fest it's going to get an open Beta test. Seems like it will be filled with a <em>lot</em> of content too.</p>
<p>More about it from the Steam page: "Team Fortress 2 Classic is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that re-imagines the early post-launch era — circa 2008 to 2009 — of the original game. Starting from there, we've added quality-of-life features, remade and reworked scrapped content, and built onto it with full-size updates in homage to TF2's timeless style and tone."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16192301921759250721gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Just a small slice of what's new in the mod includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination, Territorial Domination, and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every TF2C-exclusive weapon, gamemode, and map* will be returning, available for you to play with during the open beta! A handful of new additions we've made including damage feedback, balance changes, revamped Four-Team support, and more will also be available for testing. Additionally, we have a few extra surprises waiting for you.</p>
<p>Features that won't be showing up just yet are ones mostly unrelated to the core gameplay experience. Achievements and custom weapon support won't be available during the open beta, but are still slated for launch. We're also eyeing further work to the main menu and weapon balancing.</p>
<p>In addition to officially hosted servers, a number of community servers will also be hosting during the event. We've been working with them over the last month to iron out any crashes or technical issues.</p>
<p><em>*Casbah will not be returning in its current form. We apologize for not removing it sooner.</em></p>

      <title>Fallout: London mod gets a huge upgrade with &#34;Rabbit &amp; Pork&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team FOLON today announced the huge Rabbit &amp; Pork update for the popular Fallout 4 mod Fallout: London. It expands the game in some massive ways.</p>
<p>You can expect to see new quests, companions and lots and lots of bug fixes to smoothen the experience - a lot of which were taken from community feedback on it. In addition to the existing GOG release, they're also now doing their own custom launcher powered by <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Overwolf</a>. They also recommend starting a new save for it as otherwise you might see issues.</p>
<p>More about it if you missed it previously: "Set in a reimagined post-apocalyptic London, Fallout: London brings authentic London flavor to the Fallout universe with new factions, locations, and up to 90 hours of gameplay. Built as a completely different experience of Fallout 4, it features a brand-new story, original weapons, London-centric items, and a vast recreation of the ruined city to discover. The “Rabbit &amp; Pork” DLC marks a milestone in its development, delivering the most polished experience yet while making installation faster and more reliable for players worldwide."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new in the update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>80 fully-voiced NPCs with 8,000+ new dialogue lines.</li>
<li>30 new quests &amp; minigames.</li>
<li>30 new weapons &amp; armors.</li>
<li>70 new random encounters.</li>
<li>New companion &amp; player home.</li>
<li>New content for early faction introductions.</li>
<li>Thousands of bug fixes and stability improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UIZx_KF3Kkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cbf8b6c558a9dc90a3e394fa12be85d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UIZx_KF3Kkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>They're calling it a DLC, but it's not a DLC in the traditional sense of the term. It's an update for the mod.</em></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Rabbit &amp; Pork represents the next iteration of Fallout: London. It’s the most complete and stable version yet, with brand-new storylines and characters that push our vision even further,” said Dean Carter, CEO for Team FOLON. “Working with Overwolf to launch the custom installer makes this experience more accessible than ever, removing barriers so fans can dive straight into London.”</p>
<p>“The sheer talent and dedication of Team FOLON is proof that in-game creators are shaping the future of gaming,” said Uri Marchand, CEO at Overwolf. “Projects like Fallout: London show how UGC can extend the shelf life of the world’s most beloved games, bringing fresh lore, worlds, and characters long after launch. Overwolf’s mission is to empower these visionary creators, and we’re proud to help bring their work to millions of players with our easy-to-access launcher.”</p>
<p>You'll need Wine / Proton to play it on Linux since it's a mod for a Windows game. It appeared to work <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/fallout-london-mod-for-fallout-4-has-released-today-on-gog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when I previously tested the original release</a>, with help from Heroic Launcher (check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our guide to GOG games on Linux</a>).</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 580.95.05 released as the latest recommended for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have launched their latest recommended driver for Linux users with driver version 580.95.05 now available.</p>
<p>With it being their latest "Recommended/Certified" driver it means you should be good to upgrade to this version for all your gaming and other needs. As NVIDIA explain: "This driver meets the quality levels applied to Windows drivers that pass testing in Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), therefore providing the same attention to driver reliability, robustness, and performance for non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux)".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for YCbCr 4:2:2 display modes over HDMI Fixed Rate Link (FRL). This capability is only supported on Blackwell or later.</li>
<li>Downgraded an error message "Failed to allocate NvKmsKapiDevice" to an informational message "NUMA was not set up yet; ignoring this device" when initializing nvidia-drm in cases where initialization is expected to fail due to NUMA not being online.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused interactive object outlines to not be rendered in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced in the 575 driver series that caused GPUs to be powered on unnecessarily when processing redundant system power source notifications from the ACPI subsystem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254665/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></p>
<p>And in case you missed the recent news <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/nvidia-are-investing-5-billion-in-intel-to-develop-new-chips-together/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA are investing $5 billion in Intel</a> to develop new chips together.</p>
<p><strong>Update 01/10/25</strong>: they also released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254657/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.195.03</a> the same day that notes "Minor bug fixes and improvements".</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Spectacular Team: Assemble, a physics-based super hero action game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spectacular Team: Assemble is a silly physics-based action game about customizable super heroes, with a demo available for testing. The developer emailed noting their plan for full Native Linux support at release, and the demo also has a Linux version available (although Steam only shows a Windows icon for the demo currently - they've missed a tickbox somewhere).</p>
<p>More about it: "The city is overrun with villains, and your team is the one to stop them. Put your heroes to the test in diverse battles: from epic duels to chaotic street brawls, and earn incredible rewards. Collect powerful gear, quirky costumes, and rare weapons to enhance your heroes' effectiveness and style."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lIapW3JLBPA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/190012b8f116e38397887ca0edfad07e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lIapW3JLBPA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Your Unique Heroes</strong> - Unleash your creativity with a vast selection of equipment parts and abilities! Mix, match, and build your team of perfect superheroes. Want a robot with a medieval helmet wielding a katana? No problem! In "Spectacular Team: Assemble," every hero is a unique, unpredictable masterpiece.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Abilities</strong> - Your heroes' power goes far beyond fists and weapons. Equip them with a wide range of super abilities: from telekinesis and laser vision to vampirism and teleportation. Mix and match abilities to create wild combinations that will surprise enemies and make your heroes unstoppable.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Your Command Center </strong>- Your hero factory isn’t just a base; it’s the key to saving the world! Upgrade your command center to unlock new technologies, expand your team, and refine hero production. Turn your base into an extraordinary hub of superhero excellence and assemble the ultimate team!</li>
<li><strong>Assemble Your Dream Team and Save the World</strong> - From modifying heroes to completing missions and upgrading your base, "Spectacular Team: Assemble" delivers action, creativity, and chaos. Dive into the most unexpected physics-based superhero experience—where every battle is a chance to be truly spectacular!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They previously added Linux support to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/save-the-world-from-insidious-and-cruel-demons-in-bosorka-with-a-linux-version-available-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bosorka</a> after release but they want it at release this time. So they're looking for feedback on their demo. Give it a test and let them know in their Steam forum.</p>

      <title>Inspired by gameshows Task Time looks like a quality chaotic local and online party game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking some inspiration from silly TV gameshows, Task Time needs to be on your list if you're after more games to play with friends either locally or online. I've been trying to find more for my own crew lately, and this looks like just the ticket we need.</p>
<p>A recent announcement from publisher Wired Productions and developer ReadGraves who have worked on titles like Gang Beasts, Fall Guys and more. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10850360071759231570gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10850360071759231570gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19254113941759231572gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19254113941759231572gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I’ve seen members of the Wired team transform from quiet and measured souls, into mouth frothing and evil laughing demons while playtesting Task Time. That is enough for me to know ReadGraves have delivered a wonderfully chaotic party game” said Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions. </p>
<p>“We made Task Time to see what happens when you throw a gameshow, a physics engine and all your friends into a blender.” Said Sam Read-Graves, Creator of Developer ReadGraves. “Task Time is competitive, chaotic and completely unpredictable, where no two rounds are ever the same. It’s an excuse to laugh at each other, celebrate small victories, glorious failures and delight in ruining your friends’ plans. The rules change every minute and the game doesn’t care about fairness; it cares about giving you stories to shout about afterwards and we're really happy Wired Productions have joined us on our journey of chaos. To be honest, we wanted to make WarioWare but Nintendo already did that, so we made some friendslop instead.”  </p>
<p>It looks like a real blast! Check out the reveal trailer:</p>

      <title>Evil Empire (Dead Cells, The Rogue Prince of Persia) take over Brotato with a plan for more updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Evil Empire who did lots of work on Dead Cells and made The Rogue Prince of Persia have announced they're taking over future development of Brotato.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1942280/view/506214931042926789" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the original developer Blobfish Games want to make some new games, so they're moving on. This is where Evil Empire comes in, with a plan for lots more. Evil Empire have already pushed out a first update with a new Gobbler enemy that will steal materials with another small update planned to arrive in late October. </p>
<p>A lot more is to come, with plans to be announced later to gain feedback from players. Basically we'll get "more content for the game, more often" but they're also "aware that too much content can bloat a roguelike, so don’t worry, we’ll be considering each addition carefully".</p>
<p>Some of what they want to do includes "regular updates (and betas of updates), plus we’ll also be doing other things like quality-of-life additions, various improvements and bug fixes. Maybe even a DLC".</p>
<p>Patch notes for the latest release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the Gobbler enemy that steals materials</li>
<li>Added the Gobbler's Hat item + its challenge to unlock it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed challenges being duplicated when using retry-wave</li>
<li>Fixed Burning Spread stat and Damage against bosses translation in Simplified Chinese</li>
<li>Fixed Giant Belt description in Simplified Chinese</li>
<li>Fixed German translation for the Padding item</li>
<li>Increased precision of stat gains. Getting 5 Harvesting with 80% reduced Harvesting gain now correctly results in 1 Harvesting</li>
<li>Updated to Godot version 3.6.1</li>
</ul>

      <title>Terminator 2D: NO FATE delayed again and now releases in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For the second time the release date of Terminator 2D: NO FATE has been moved, and now it's going to arrive on November 26th.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/terminator-2d-no-fate-moves-to-an-october-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Previously it was delayed</a> from September to October due to physical releases taking longer than expected, and they want to sync up digital and physical releases. The latest delay they claim is due to "ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions". They still want both digital and physical editions to launch together, so this should hopefully give them enough time to ensure that's possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully we won't see a third delay.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience the events of ‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’ brought to life through glorious pixel artwork and action-packed arcade gameplay! Play as Sarah Connor and the T-800 through a variety of thrilling missions as they take on the T-1000 and try to put a stop to Skynet’s plans before the human race is annihilated. Lead the Resistance as John Connor in the future, fighting on the front lines as mankind’s only hope in the War Against the Machines. In this unique story blending iconic scenes from ‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’ with original scenarios and multiple endings, humanity’s fate is yours to decide."</p>

      <title>Confirmed - Electronic Arts (EA) sold off to investors including Saudi Arabia&#39;s Public Investment Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is. It's now official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/ea-reportedly-to-be-sold-off-for-roughly-50-billion-to-go-private/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after earlier reports</a> that EA (Electronic Arts) is being sold off to an investor consortium.</p>
<p>EA put up a press release going over some of the details including a confirmation that the new owners will include PIF (Public Investment Fund - Saudi Arabia), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners (formed by Jared Kushner). In the press release they noted it's an "all-cash transaction" to the value of <em>approximately</em> $55 billion, which will result in them taking 100% of EA.</p>
<p>While the move has been approved by EA's Board of Directors, it isn't yet a complete and finished deal. They still have to go through the normal regulatory approvals process and gain approval from EA stockholders on the deal. They expect it to be all finalised in the first quarter of their 2027 financial year. From the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=712515" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filings</a> EA will have to pay a $1 billion termination fee if the deal falls through either due to the changes in the decision from their board, a better deal was found or stock holders revolt on it.</p>
<p>When the move is done their HQ will remain in California and Andrew Wilson will stay on as CEO.</p>
<p>This, according to the PR, makes it the "largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history". It really is huge, and considering how big EA actually are with all their controlled franchises it's a massive sweeping change for the games industry. Around $36 billion of it is from the equity investment, while $20 billion is from debt financing — which is an eye watering amount so brace for some cost-cutting to come (and layoffs probably).</p>
<p>EA controls the likes of The Sims, Battlefield, Command &amp; Conquer, Apex Legends, Titanfall, Star Wars Jedi series, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, skate., EA Sports FC and more.</p>
<p>Here's all the fancy-worded statements from the PR:</p>
<p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>
<p>“PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and esports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators,” said Turqi Alnowaiser, Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments at PIF. “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to these sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”</p>
<p>“This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.”</p>
<p>“Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future. ​I've admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids - I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead,” said Jared Kushner, Chief Executive Officer of Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>“The Board carefully evaluated this opportunity and concluded it delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders,” said Luis A. Ubiñas, Lead Independent Director of EA’s Board of Directors. “We are pleased that this transaction delivers immediate and certain cash value to our stockholders while strengthening EA’s ability to continue building the communities and experiences that define the future of entertainment.”</p>

      <title>Pull the lever to gamble and break the machine in CloverPit, a slot machine with horror vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CloverPit from Panik Arcade and Future Friends Games has released bringing you the true horrors of a slot machine rogue-lite as you try to save your life. Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>A game that could be called a horrific fusion of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette for the gameplay and style, it will have you repeatedly pull that lever in the hopes of paying off a seemingly never-ending debt. Just you locked up in a small room with a slot machine, a toilet and a few other things to keep you busy.</p>

<p>It's another in the list of growing games designed for you to <em>break</em> it as much as possible. You have to spend your money wisely on various special charms to help you earn big to pay off that debt. Pull the lever, play multiple rounds and deposit your cash into the ATM to bank it and repeat as much as possible.</p>
<p>Since it's a rogue-lite, each run through will be a little different on how it goes. Some rounds you may win big, others not so much. The horror theme is certainly an interesting twist on it, with multiple possible endings and a death-drop below you if you don't manage to pay it off. You literally get dropped down a deep dark hole, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>You know, giving you that real feeling of losing big time that some gambling addicts likely feel with the weight of it all. No laughing matter though, it's a real problem but this is still a game with a slot machine in the centre of it. The developer is very clear on their thoughts on it though noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"CloverPit is not a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome. If you’re looking for a real gambling experience please look elsewhere. Or better yet, don’t look at all. We don’t really like gambling. That’s what the game is about!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6f_6xETRrOI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb4332f73ec857571b74fa54c2c37de1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6f_6xETRrOI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Each round you successfully complete, the debt will grow. Not only that, but the cost to play also rises with it as does the amount you have to deposit into the ATM. It's a frightening game of ever-growing numbers. A constant panic between trying to spend coin to make coin, buying up charms to increase your chances of screwing with the odds in your favour to depositing your needed cash to beat the round. Lots of difficult choices, and you will no doubt fail a great many hours before you feel like you're really getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Even just deciding how much coin to put into the slot machine is at times a challenging choice. You can deposit more coin to get more pulls but only 1 charm ticket, or deposit less to have fewer pulls of the lever and more charm tickets. It's the whole risk versus reward, but amplified by the thought of being dropped into the dark pit and having to start again where you can try something different.</p>
<p>There are of course a number of ways you can cheese through it, especially once you get the hang of it. But games are supposed to be about fun right? Not necessarily finding the easiest way to grind through it to complete it quickly. There's hundreds of charms, and with the right combinations, you can do some pretty funny things to the results of each pull of the lever. It's about seeing how far you can push it and watching as all your charms slide into the screen to keep pumping your numbers up as high as possible.</p>
<p>You do have a limit on the amount of charms you're allowed to have in play during each round though, so you have to choose wisely here too. It's not just about stacking as many as possible,</p>
<p>CloverPit does throw some pain your way too, like encountering 666. If you find that pattern, it's brutal, you'll lose all money earned that round and once you into the later rounds it really can destroy you. You do get a little extra help here and there, with strange phone calls where you're offered certain types of bonuses. Some of these can be especially helpful and can really save your ass during a run!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11782412071759149111gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11782412071759149111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One of the keys is to really focus on certain symbols, and put your charms and phone call upgrades as much as possible into those as well as general luck boosts. So that way you can stack up as much as possible from specific symbols on the machine. Easier said than done, but once you get it you're in for some monstrous winnings where you might end up seeing millions and more from a single pull.</p>
<p>You really do get the firm sense of being <em>required</em> to just have one more round. It's deliciously addictive, but in the non-destructive sense where the only real money you're paying is the single purchase cost. Excellent atmosphere, and really fun to try out all the different charms to try and mess with the slot machine.</p>
<p>CloverPit is Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton. </p>
<p>Another big indie hit too, with it hitting over 100,000 sales in 24 hours. It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam at time of writing.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app 0.17.2 brings early work on a built-in downloads page and performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work is ongoing on the new cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app to support more games, and a smaller release is out now for more testing.</p>
<p>It's getting more exciting with some of their planned features like the built-in downloads page, along with easier library sorting and performance improvements in this release. Currently the app has full support for Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk, with work ongoing towards Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Skyrim. They haven't actually announced it yet, but work has also started for supporting Fallout 4 and it now appears as a placeholder in the app.</p>

      <title>More major updates coming to Minecraft - some highlights from Minecraft Live (September 2025)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mclive_fall2025_recap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Minecraft Live</a> has again come and gone (twice a year now), so here's just some of what's coming to the popular open-world game with major updates planned.</p>
<p>Firstly, The Copper Age releases on September 30th, so tomorrow you'll be able to dive into the latest update for the game. This will bring Copper Bars, Copper Chain, Copper CHest, Copper Golem Statue, Copper Lantern, Copper Torch and many more Copper related items. The Shelf is going to be a highlight as a new storage block allowing you to stack items in your fancy little house, along with the Copper Armour set and especially the Copper Golem that will help you sort through your Chests.</p>
<p>Another big update coming is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mounts of Mayhem</a> arriving later this year. This will bring the Nautilus, an underwater mount mob that allows you to fully explore the watery depths of Minecraft. Much like the Happy Ghast, you can build from it, and you won't lose oxygen while riding it. There will also be a Zombie Nautilus, which can be mounted by the Drowned. So underwater fights are about to get interesting…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18352852281759145113gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Mounts of Mayhem will also add a new tiered weapon, the Spear, which allows you to craft it from different materials with each one acting in a slightly different way which sounds fun. It also has two different kinds of attacks with a jab or a charged attack, and if you go faster (like on a mount) it will hit harder. You're going to need it too, as Zombie Horses are finally making their way into survival mode in Minecraft with the update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2067234031759145069gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can see the highlights video below:</p>

<p>Quite excited about all the planned stuff to come, might finally be time for me to start up a new world with the family. Such a great game to play with others.</p>

      <title>Cronos: The New Dawn gets performance improvements and a Linux HDR fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest horror game from Bloober Team, and with the latest update it should work a lot better for everyone. It has a Native Linux version and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified, although the Steam Deck verification uses Proton by default for it.</p>
<p>Nice to see the developer continuing to make it better after release. With the update landing Friday 26th, they noted in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2101960/announcements/detail/498333631688737264" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they "Fixed an issue where linux version had problems with enabling HDR". That's on top of many optimisations:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance spikes when stomping on biomass.</li>
<li>Improved performance spikes when stomping on enemies.</li>
<li>Improved RT Performance.</li>
<li>Improved performance spikes on streaming.</li>
<li>Improved memory usage.</li>
<li>Multiple overall GPU and CPU performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus a reasonably long list of bug fixes landed for it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19218518101759143636gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.</p>
<p>Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.</p>
<p>In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.</p>
<p>You are a Traveler working for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport you to 1980s-era Poland.</p>

      <title>Blood: Refreshed Supply announced from Nightdive Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving in December, Blood: Refreshed Supply has been revealed by Nightdive Studios as the true definitive remaster of the 1997 cult classic PC game.</p>
<p>Even though there's already Blood: Fresh Supply from 2019, this new version will feature various other extra technical enhancements to the game including up to 4K resolution at unlocked frame rates, local split-screen and online co-op for up to 8 players, a Vault with behind-the-scenes development content, new mission scenarios, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to the original Blood campaign and the Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage add-ons, Blood: Refreshed Supply features two new mission scenarios: Marrow (available at launch) and Death Wish (releasing post-launch).</p>

<p>"Since we released Blood: Fresh Supply six years ago, the demand from fans to have this iconic game on consoles has been immense," said Larry Kuperman, VP of Business Development at Nightdive Studios. "With our partners at Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Nightdive and Atari can now deliver on those demands and finally bring Blood to modern consoles. We didn’t stop there, though. Refreshed Supply is the definitive edition of Blood, with additional improvements made and exciting new content from Nightdive."</p>

<li>CD and MIDI music support.</li>
<li>Includes existing add-ons Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage.</li>
<li>New mission scenarios, Marrow and Death Wish, pump new blood into… Blood! Marrow will be available at launch, while Death Wish will release as a free post-launch update.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Splatterbot is a quality family-friendly party game about making a big mess</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new game to play with friends and family? Splatterbot is a good choice and it's a great laugh if you're a bit competitive. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Released September 3rd from developer Hey! Kookaburra, it has a Native Linux version. No current Steam Deck rating from Valve, but I can assure you it works perfectly. It's a local multiplayer splat-fest, where you each control a little cleaning robot. The bots have gone rogue though, and instead of cleaning up you're spreading paint everywhere as quickly as you possibly can.</p>
<p>It's a competitive game for up to 4 players (with AI bots available), where each player has a different colour, with you individually controlling a little bot to drive around the little arenas and cover them in your colour. So it's a bit like a mini Splatoon but with robot vacuums and small arenas.</p>
<p>It's funny as hell once you get going, with rounds that don't overstay their welcome but are long enough for you to really get into it with your friends and family. Nice little choice of dynamic maps too, each with their own interesting ways you use the map to your advantage. My favourite is easily the wrestling-like arena with the bouncy ropes, which can be total chaos once you've all picked up a few power-ups to increase your size, and spawn some coloured balls — with all 4 of you zipping and bouncing around.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MjAiOZaIC0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/097447e5b84fbfc789fe320abff299b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MjAiOZaIC0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Very accessible for a younger (or older) audience with the super-simple controls. We were repeatedly beaten by a pre-teen in our testing of it, so that says a lot about it and we all had a great time with it. The amount of times they managed to bounce me into the water on one particular map — annoying! But funny.</p>
<p>With a mixture of power-ups like increasing your speed, size, make a big colour splat and rolling balls with your colour - it all fills up quickly. The key is using every power-up and the map layout to your advantage, to overwrite everyone else's colour with yours. The power-ups spawn in randomly, so it's a case of who can get to them first so no one really has any advantage here. Even if you manage to increase your size, another player may be able to get the speed power-ups so it's just a question of who can splat the most.</p>
<p>My main wish for Splatterbot is that it had a wider assortment of power-ups, as the rolling balls don't work especially well on some of the maps. If they had a few different ones for each map, that would have been perfection.</p>
<p>Other than that it firmly succeeds on the core idea of it bringing people together for a good laugh. Chaotic, great fun and works perfectly. One to add to your party list for sure.</p>

      <title>You&#39;re on colossal cleaning duty in Kaiju Cleanup</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clearly the developers at Brightrock Games are big fans of Kaiju No. 8, with the reveal of Kaiju Cleanup at the Tokyo Game Show. Brightrock Games previously made War for the Overworld and Galacticare so now they're trying their hand at something quite different.</p>
<p>A gross job, but someone has to do it right? You've all seen the movies and anime with massive creatures getting slain. Who exactly deals with the aftermath? You, in Kaiju Cleanup. You're on team KaijuCorp to help cleanup the disaster zones which includes slicing, dicing, clawing, slurping, and packaging up the bodies of massive monsters to leave the environment clean.</p>
<p>A more casual sim, even with the bloody setting, with you able to go at your own pace while you complete missions and customize your loadout. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="my1eXwGY0Ro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b442db0cd32eb47c7b3aade695b5ba6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/my1eXwGY0Ro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We’re thrilled to reveal our monster new IP Kaiju Cleanup today, in partnership with the hugely talented development team at Brightrock Games," said Stuart Morton, Publishing Director at Mythwright. "Kaiju Cleanup brings a new monster-sized twist to the beloved cleaning simulation genre, soaked with quirky humour and satisfying gameplay, and sprinkled with scenarios that Kaiju disaster fans are going to love."</p>
<p>The developers at Brightrock said: "For those of you who've been with us for a while, we know this is a departure from our usual faire and might come as a bit of a surprise! After Galacticare — which was a big project for us — we wanted to try our hands at something smaller, lighter, and… messier. Looking further into the future, we’ve also got some other projects in the works, including a return to our roots deep underground."</p>
<p>No release date has been announced yet but you can apply for the Steam Playtest.</p>
<p>Love the idea of this, and I had wondered how long it would be before we saw games do this setting, especially with the popularity of Kaiju No. 8 that just recently finished season 2 of the anime.</p>

      <title>OpenMW 0.50.0 for Morrowind has a first Release Candidate with gamepad support and a gamepad UI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An exciting release for the Morrowind game engine OpenMW is coming, with the first Release Candidate out for version 0.50.0 bringing some big changes. This free and open source cross-platform game engine is the best way to play Morrowind, and it's about to get even better!</p>
<p>One major change coming is much improved gamepad support, along with a new optional gamepad-tailored interface you can enable in their launcher. They also said that "even if you’re a hard-boiled mouse and keyboard enthusiast, you should appreciate the variety of UI fixes and game mechanics fixes coming with this update, as well as the steps made towards dehardcoding combat".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2997952341759139993gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2997952341759139993gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now this RC release is only meant for testers to try and break it, and report any issues ready for the final release for everyone. They said that "continuing your existing playthroughs should be safe, but keep in mind that mods that work extensively with UI layout files must be updated to be compatible with the UI changes". Additionally for modders that mods that use "OpenMW-Lua may also need to be updated — so double-check if your setup is up to speed".</p>
<p>Save formats haven't changed since the previous release, so you should be able to swap between for testing but they still don't recommend it until they find and fix some issues as they come up.</p>
<p>This is exciting, when OpenMW 0.50.0 is out, it will make playing it on handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally even better.</p>

      <title>Open source strategy shooter Unvanquished gets a big new release with SDL3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unvanquished is a free and open source cross-platform humans versus aliens strategy shooter, with a big new release out now that features SDL3.</p>
<p>Release <a href="https://unvanquished.net/unvanquished-0-55-5-polishing-it/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unvanquished 0.55.5</a> is now available, but it's mostly work on the back-end in preparation for more gameplay upgrades with the 0.56.0 series to come.</p>
<p>However, they have teased one thing coming, which is making the renderer colorspace-aware. Work has been ongoing since 2019 on this to improve the lighting in the game. It's not <em>yet</em> being used as there's still a bit of work to be done on it, but hopefully it will be in the 0.56 release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10006777391759139594gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10006777391759139594gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>On the left: legacy naive lighting, on the right: colorspace-aware lighting.</em></p>
<p>The release also includes memory leak fixes, render optimizations, various graphical glitches were fixed and more.</p>
<p>A lot of work for this release went into their game engine behind the scenes, to bring more of it up to modern standards. With SDL3 it now has Wayland support, along with all the other goodies the bump from SDL2 to SDL3 brings like enhanced support for basically everything from windowing to input.</p>
<p>To make it easier for developers new and old, they also reworked their build system moving their Linux baseline from Debian Buster to Debian Bullseye, to be a bit more modern while supporting as many systems as possible. And hopefully thanks to all the background upgrades from compilers to libraries - a better overall game.</p>
<p>Nice to see this open source game more alive than ever.</p>

      <title>EA reportedly to be sold off for &#34;roughly $50 billion&#34; to go private</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/09/25 14:31 UTC</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/confirmed-electronic-arts-ea-sold-off-to-investors-including-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this deal is now confirmed</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sources of the funds will apparently come from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners amongst others.</p>
<p>Coming from info from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">WSJ</a>, the final price has yet to be agreed on and it will be a "leveraged buyout", which is where a large portion of the money comes from borrowed money. Which would make this the largest leveraged buyout ever, and a significant change in hands for the gaming industry due to just how big EA actually is.</p>
<p>EA control a <em>lot</em> of major franchises including The Sims, Battlefield, Command &amp; Conquer, Apex Legends, Titanfall, Star Wars Jedi series, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, skate., EA Sports FC and the list goes on.</p>
<p>When these things tend to happen, as we've seen many times in the past (and a lot recently), job losses tend to come with things either when it happens or sometime soon after. So there's going to be masses of eyes on this for that too.</p>
<p>If the deal goes through, we could hear about it this week.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>Smash some balls on the go as BALL x PIT is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BALL x PIT is a ball-smashing brick-breaking action-packed roguelite that's releasing in October and it's now Steam Deck Verified. From Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital, this is one of the most promising games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/ball-x-pit-is-a-delicious-challenge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I tested during a previous Steam Next Fest</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam announcement, they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/541117828155048579" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that BALL x PIT is now Steam Deck Verified: "We’ve got some cool news to share: BALL x PIT will be Steam Deck Verified at launch on October 15! That means the game runs smoothly, looks great, and fully supports the Steam Deck’s built-in controls and screen. So yes, you can now take the balls anywhere. And we really hope you do".</p>
<p>It was popular, with it being the 12th most played game in June's Steam Next Fest. BALL x PIT sees you batter hordes of enemies with a barrage of projectiles that can be evolved, upgraded and combined to create all manner of overpowered synergies. Gather the riches of the pit to expand your homestead, generate resources and recruit unique heroes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GEK4dEOAQCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7774e93fe64821a83b0c04cbee6800b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The status isn't live on the Steam page yet, but developers get notice before it goes public. So soon the Steam page will note it also.</p>
<p>A demo is still up so you can try it right now. The game releases October 15th.</p>
<p><em>I have a key for it ready to review, so expect some proper thoughts sometime around the release.</em></p>

      <title>Saveseeker is an upcoming time-travelling RPG with a twist</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In Saveseeker you're an eight year old time-travelling girl on a quest to stop her former Hero father from using his powers to destroy the world. Quite a fun sounding premise with this, and there's a demo available right now. It doesn't support controller yet, but the developer has confirmed they plan to add support later.</p>
<p>Playing as the young Emmer Edette, you have inherited your father's unique ability to <em>save</em> moments in time. But this once-heroic gift has been corrupted — Emmer's father, a legendary Hero, now uses his powers for destructive ends. With her grumpy toy dragon companion, Tippleton, Emmer must journey across six distinct lands, overwrite every "Save Stop" her father left behind, and face him in a final showdown.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G90C7nUKh88"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb8a00b0be92ed3a924f8428b0ee6f0a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G90C7nUKh88" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A quest that begins at the end</strong> – Step into a world forever changed by a legendary Hero. Travel across six distinct lands, reclaim corrupted “Save Stops,” and uncover the truth behind your father’s downfall before his misuse of power brings everything to ruin.</li>
<li><strong>Unlikely allies with their own agendas</strong> – Recruit five of the Hero’s defeated foes, brought to life with beautiful Ghibli-esque character design. Each ex-boss brings unique abilities and personalities to your party. Discover their motivations, combine their skills in battle, and see how old enemies can become indispensable friends.</li>
<li><strong>Time-bending turn-based combat</strong> – Emmer’s inherited power to “save” time adds a fresh twist to classic RPG combat. Rewind to rethink your strategy, set up powerful combos, and turn the tide against enemies that demand more than brute strength.</li>
<li><strong>Worlds full of character and challenge</strong> – Explore beautifully animated pixel-art worlds, from the shadowy Badwoods to the mechanical marvel of the airship Aertemis. Each setting is packed with puzzles, enemies, and secrets tailored to its unique atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Secrets and surprises around every corner</strong> – Venture off the main path to play minigames, uncover hidden lore, and earn powerful equipment. Every discovery adds more depth to Emmer’s journey and rewards those who take time to explore.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really do love the setting and style in this one. Playable on Linux with Proton. The full game launches sometime in 2026 with no set date announced yet.</p>

      <title>System76 COSMIC desktop Beta and Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two huge bits of news from System76, as they've released a Beta for both the new COSMIC desktop and Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS bringing lots of goodies.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting how System76 develop their own hardware, and run their own Linux distribution and now they're firmly getting into the Desktop Environment game with COSMIC designed for other vendors (distros and other organisations) to customize it. The official <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">COSMIC page</a> notes how it's "Best for users, best for your product" with the customization it allows.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>System76 has been building COSMIC to propel the Linux desktop to new heights of user empowerment. It will replace their custom version of the GNOME DE on Pop!_OS to reimagine the desktop environment and the value it provides. Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with COSMIC includes a custom theming system, customizable panels UI, enhanced workspaces system, streamlined tiling and keyboard shortcuts, and new core apps.</p>
<p>COSMIC is about empowering users to easily create their preferred workflow, emphasizing customizability to create the best, most consistent and flexible experience available. System76 understands that users know best how to use their computer for success. By enabling their personal preferences, they can remove obstacles to focus and empower themselves to unleash their potential.</p>
<p>With COSMIC, users can make their UI single- or dual-panel, workspaces horizontal or vertical, tiled or floating, dynamic or pinned (static), add new keyboard shortcuts, change Caps Lock, arrange applets (features on panels), create and share themes, and even add custom fonts or icons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It comes with a bunch of the expected core desktop applications designed for COSMIC including COSMIC Settings, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Store, COSMIC Terminal, COSMIC Edit, and COSMIC Player. More COSMIC apps can be found in the Store's Explore page in the Made For COSMIC section.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15838417861758880427gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15838417861758880427gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1004205891758880428gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1004205891758880428gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>System76 are keen to talk up how they built it with Rust, from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COSMIC is written from scratch in Rust, a programming language System76 engineers loved working with for its readability, stability, maintainability, and memory safety; many modern computer vulnerabilities happen in the system’s memory, and Rust makes it easy to write memory-safe code. As a newer language, this required a lot of groundwork in building the fundamental capability to create a desktop environment in the first place. System76 needed to build a complete toolkit of high-level components with deep platform integration, all designed to create a consistent look and feel for the COSMIC desktop environment. That effort resulted in the libcosmic toolkit, a robust, responsive set of widgets that adhere to the specific COSMIC design language. This includes buttons, sliders, text inputs, and other elements that are styled to match the rest of the desktop.</p>
<p>During development, the team even had to build basic features like text rendering, drag-and-drop, clipboard support, a full-featured compositor and support for input methods. But with such a modern codebase, System76 was able to avoid the significant technical debt that comes with generations of legacy code that complicates other desktop environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061597191758880429gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6061597191758880429gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18290536971758880429gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18290536971758880429gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The COSMIC Beta is available with the Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta and for testing in Fedora, NixOS, Arch, CachyOS and others.</p>
<p>As for the Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta, System76 supplied some release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta includes the new COSMIC Desktop Environment designed and developed by System76. COSMIC DE is largely feature complete for the first release and development focus has turned to bug fixes for the final release. ● This is a beta release and some bugs are expected. </li>
<li>Some GNOME apps are replaced by COSMIC apps 
	<ul>
<li>GNOME Files (Nautilus) &gt; COSMIC Files </li>
<li>GNOME Terminal &gt; COSMIC Terminal </li>
<li>GNOME Text Editor &gt; COSMIC Text Editor </li>
<li>GNOME Media Player (Totem) &gt; COSMIC Media Player </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pop!_Shop is replaced by COSMIC Store </li>
<li>Key components 
	<ul>
<li>COSMIC Epoch 1 Beta </li>
<li>Linux kernel 6.16.3 </li>
<li>Mesa 25.1.5-1 </li>
<li>NVIDIA Driver 580 </li>
<li>libwayland/libwayland-client 1.23.1-3 </li>
<li>libdrm 2.4.125-1 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dragging and Dropping files from Wayland apps to X11 apps is not currently supported. For instance dragging files from COSMIC Files to Slack. Use the applications upload option as a work-around until the feature is added. </li>
<li>On distributions other than Pop!_OS, Firefox may need a configuration flag set to match COSMIC theming 
	<ul>
<li>Go to about:config and set widget.gtk.libadwaita-colors.enabled to false </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Chrome based browsers 
	<ul>
<li>As of Google Chrome version 140, no configuration is necessary for Wayland ○ For versions prior to 140 and other Chrome based browsers that aren’t updated, setting the ozone-platform-hint is necessary. Go to chrome://flags in a tab, search for ozone-platform-hint and change the setting to “auto”. Restart the browser. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gaming is working well but we expect to need more fixes in our xwayland implementation for the Release Candidate. 
	<ul>
<li>Some games may start partially off screen. Press F11 or Super+F11 to full screen the game (Goat Simulator is one example) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display toggle hotkeys and an on-screen-display is not supported yet.</li>
<li>The “Accent hint” around windows doesn’t match the roundness style setting in Appearance. This is expected for at least COSMIC apps for the Release Candidate.</li>
<li>COSMIC has a built-in screenshot tool. If you require annotations, we recommend Flameshot which can be installed from Flathub via COSMIC Store. Version 13.1 or higher is required for COSMIC. </li>
<li>COSMIC Store doesn’t currently display Flatpak suggested addons for apps. This is planned for the Release Candidate.</li>
<li>Accessibility: The screen reader may not read all COSMIC apps widgets or may read them in an unintuitive direction. We’re working on screen reader flow and navigation for the Release Candidate. </li>
<li>Some application indicators do not appear in the Notification Tray applet.</li>
<li>Switching to an application using its application indicator does not currently work.</li>
<li>Printing support in COSMIC Text Editor is planned for the release candidate</li>
<li>Additional features and bugs expected to be fixed are triaged in the RC column on the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pop-os/projects/23/views/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">project board </a></li>
</ul>

      <title>ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally up for pre-order to take on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft and Asus have now put the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally up for pre-order, ready to take on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>We continue to see handhelds move in the wrong direction on pricing though. The ROG Xbox Ally X is USD $999.99, but the ROG Xbox Ally is a more reasonable USD $599.99. The problem is, Valve's Steam Deck just <em>cannot</em> be beaten on the price to performance ratio, especially with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/grab-the-steam-deck-lcd-256gb-for-cheap-as-valve-gave-it-a-discount/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">currently having a 20% discount</a> making it truly worth grabbing.</p>
<p>Even having the higher specifications on the Xbox Ally X, with the Z2 Extreme chip, the performance difference really isn't going to be worth that price tag. Especially so for the plain Xbox Ally, with a similar chip to the Steam Deck (and powering a higher resolution screen too). However, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the anti-cheat problem on SteamOS / Linux</a> is not an issue for Windows - so that might perhaps entice a few more buyers.</p>
<p>Microsoft do have another issue here though — confusion. No doubt with the Xbox naming, there will be plenty who go in expecting traditional Xbox games to work, but they won't since like the Steam Deck it is just a PC. You may not think this is an issue, but I can guarantee it will end up as one. The masses are not particularly well informed when it comes to buying hardware - anyone who has worked retail or technical support will know it well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-pPqcWGnVDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd566cf492da1e428560c795710dba92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-pPqcWGnVDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Could be some nice devices to install <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite Linux</a> on though. How long do we think it will be before Bazzite gets support for running on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally? It will be interesting to see if Microsoft / Asus have made it difficult to install another OS on it.</p>
<p>Both devices launch October 16th. See the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-ally-starting-today/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for more info.</p>
<p>We really are entering a new world when it comes to gaming though. Valve truly laid the groundwork here for handheld PC gaming, and now everyone wants a slice of the pie. I do think these are the first actual proper competition for the Steam Deck, since there's an entry model and backing from Microsoft. Plus, Microsoft's work to bring all stores under one roof with their newer UI for handhelds that will debut with the ROG Xbox Ally - we're in for some turbulence here.</p>

      <title>Steam Link VR now available for PICO and HTC headsets, plus Valve confirm experimental Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated Steam Link VR to bring support for streaming games to PICO and HTC headsets, plus new info on the experimental Linux support.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/514096230384533860?utm_source=SteamDB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve mentioned it will now work across PICO 4 Ultra, PICO 4, PICO Neo 3, HTC Vive Focus Vision and HTC VIVE XR Elite (later this year). All those in addition to the already supported Meta Quest headsets.</p>
<p>The app has been added to the stores for both vendors, and Valve confirmed they're working on a fresh SteamVR Beta with a Steam Link APK for other hardware manufacturers to validate Steam Link on their headsets themselves, and to allow users of unsupported headsets to try it out too.</p>
<p>All part of Valve's ongoing work to make PC VR as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Earlier in September we had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-link-vr-for-meta-quest-on-linux-now-appears-to-work-in-the-latest-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux article</a> about how Steam Link VR appeared to work on Linux in the latest updates, with Valve not mentioning it anywhere. That's now changed, and has become just a <em>little</em> bit more official. On the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0E2C-406B-9135-38A4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">help page</a> for Steam Link VR, the FAQ has been expanded to note the Linux status as experimental.</p>
<p>For Linux support Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Link VR Uses Vulkan Video, and driver support for Vulkan Video is only available in the newest drivers. Please use NVIDIA drivers 575.64.05 or newer or if AMD, please use Mesa drivers [25.2.2] or newer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully Valve will sometime soon make PC VR even more interesting with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/new-valve-trademark-for-steam-frame-looks-like-were-getting-new-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame</a>.</p>

	<ul>
<li>The screen reader language may also be manually configured under Settings-&gt;Accessibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Audio</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed volume jumping to 100% upon removing 3.5mm headphones</li>
<li>Fixed USB audio devices not being automatically switched to when connected</li>
<li>Removed non-functional "Pro Audio" profile setting in desktop mode, which would disable audio until deselected</li>

<li>Fixed audio distortion with the Steam Deck microphone in game recordings</li>
</ul>

      <title>Forza Horizon 6 heads to Japan and will release on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is official, it's coming in 2026 and it will be heading to Japan. It's also already confirmed to be launching on Steam.</p>
<p>From their news post on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re thrilled to be taking players to Japan in Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in the critically acclaimed and award-winning series of open world driving games. </p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 will launch first on Xbox Series X|S consoles and PC in 2026. It will be included with Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass at launch. With the excitement for this franchise on other platforms, we also have Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch. </p>
<p>In Forza Horizon 6, you will get to discover a scenic and breathtaking Japan, where you will build up your racing status to become a Legend at the Horizon Festival.  </p>
<p>As you already know, Japan has been one of the most iconic and requested locations by the Forza Horizon community. We are so excited for you to experience it, and we can't wait to share more details on Forza Horizon 6 early next year. Stay tuned! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lwlw0ChiSR0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/36ec6766b0549179fede02fb9a935581.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lwlw0ChiSR0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can read more about the setting in the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Microsoft / Xbox Games Studios have actually been one of the better few at ensuring their games are not blocked in Proton (mostly) unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many other developers</a> when it comes to anti-cheat. They at least don't go out of their way to block Linux for their modern PC releases. However, it's worth noting that while Forza Horizon 5 works Forza Motorsport does <em>not</em>. Hopefully this one will. We'll be keeping an eye on it to let you know at release next year.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown gets a first gameplay trailer and you can keep Tuvix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is one game that I am extremely excited for, and the first gameplay trailer is now here.</p>
<p>This officially licensed game will blend exploration, crew and ship management, consequential choices, and what-if scenarios that can reshape who makes it home — and what Voyager becomes along the way. I'll finally be able to get Kes to stay, and keep Tuvix along for the ride too. I'm still undecided if Harry Kim deserves a promotion.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rKmMRBIMq2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53b3746171d8d74bf6b3b62b1f271d29.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rKmMRBIMq2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No release date or even a release window for it yet, we'll just have to wait and see. Clearly not finished yet, with the trailer noting it's a work in progress. The trailer showcases teasers for plenty of the game mechanics from repairing and upgrading the ship, to a number of important story events.</p>
<p>This and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> really are a dream come true for me, very excited by both of these worlds to be more explored.</p>
<p>What events are you hoping to see in the game to change? Perhaps never taking on 7 of 9? Let me know your wild ideas in the comments.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Wolverine gets a proper trailer and it&#39;s brutal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we don't know when it will come to PC, we at least finally have a chance to see some action in the trailer for Marvel's Wolverine.</p>
<p>It will come to PC eventually though — right? PlayStation 5 gets it in "Fall 2026", so what do we think, late in 2027? We did eventually get Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales so we have a good bet to see it on PC.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the blood-soaked trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s3pDMUWlA6I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/98eac7223d41a77ad6325089b808fcfe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a behind the scenes look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oBib2xkYfE4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a560fe50444a05ceaa66da32ae4c883.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oBib2xkYfE4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As soon as we hear of a PC release we'll let you know. By the time it does come to PC, no doubt Proton will run it on Linux systems thanks to all the work Valve has put in over the years.</p>
<p>Now, if we could just get Sony to hurry up with Death Stranding 2 on PC we'll be golden.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic is returning, with Deus Ex Remastered getting announced for release on February 5th 2026 that aims to be the "definitive edition".</p>
<p>It's another from Aspyr Media who were responsible for Tomb Raider I-III Remastered, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter, STAR WARS: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles, STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection, Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered and others.</p>
<p>Check out the brief announcement teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z-Sg7ps5WkQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57ed46a6e83f95489bfd06ac638afa9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z-Sg7ps5WkQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The reception so far doesn't exactly seem too positive, the YouTube comments are filled with complaints about how it looks. Same with the Steam forum, although that's not surprising, the Steam forums are often a mess on a lot of games. You're probably going to be unimpressed with me at this point, but I actually haven't played the original. I know, I know - there's still so many classics I haven't found the time for. Big fan of the modern games though, shame we won't see a proper conclusion.</p>
<p>Worth noting that the original Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is currently less than £1 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> until September 29th. And, if you pair it up with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deus Ex: Revision mod</a>, you're already getting a pretty good looking and much loved community remaster.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-17 released fixing Warframe as probably other games too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 10-17 was just released following on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/ge-proton-10-16-released-with-a-tweak-for-star-citizen-and-a-stellar-blade-modding-fix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-16 a few days ago</a>, to further enhanced Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. As is often the case with normal GE-Proton updates, a few issues end up being found that need a smaller fix later.</p>
<p>The single-line noted fix for GE-Proton 10-17 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Just a hotfix/refresh release, updates dxvk and other main components, fixes warframe crash and probably a few others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Pictured - Warframe</p>
<p>With all the different Proton versions it can get confusing so see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>

      <title>CHARK is a smooth Balatro-inspired chess roguelike and I&#39;ve become an instant fan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Balatro started another clear trend in gaming, with multiple games spawning like it and CHARK seems like it could end up being a real gem.</p>
<p>CHARK is a chess roguelike with a <em>very</em> similar setup to Balatro. Taking the basics of chess but turning it into something quite different overall, as it's based on rounds where you're trying to beat a very specific score of taking down enemy pieces on the board. You earn money as you go to buy extras in a shop to help you really screw with it and build up a ridiculous score. </p>
<p>The setup gives you a small cut-down version of a chess board containing your Queen and a few enemy pieces. You move your Queen across the board using cards, with each card being a different chess piece — so you get to use their moves to take out enemy pieces and build up that score to reach the goal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12909506831758717167gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While it still needs some work to make certain bits clearer, and no doubt a fair amount more content, what's there already in the idea of it is really good.</p>
<p>Another game does exist that merges together chess with Balatro in Passant: A Chess Roguelike, although that is still a fair bit different to the setup here in CHARK so that they're both quite unique. CHARK is simple, effective and has turned into a really nice way to kill some time and I think you'll like it too.</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AsxErWnjavc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f57bec9d1c312ec9c407d49163a0053e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AsxErWnjavc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game is still in the earlier stages, with the developer currently looking for a publishing partner. You can try it out right now though, and no need to install anything as you can play it right in the browser.</p>
<p>Try it free in the browser on <a href="https://protzz.itch.io/chark" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>

      <title>OVIS LOOP is a dark action roguelike about robotic sheep versus wolves and it&#39;s a real surprise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in some sort of post-apocalypse with various robotic animals, OVIS LOOP is a tale of sheep versus wolves and it's a genuine delight. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's all a bit mysterious, at least at the start as you're piecing together info about the world. Why is everything in a complete state? What's with all the robots? Why are the wolves so damn mad at you - what did you do? I need answers. Some really nice design went into this for the story, as well as the characters with the excellent pixel-art. It's the action of it that really helps to sell this one though, with a Dead Cells-like feel to it on the basics.</p>
<p>You get a sort-of deck-building element to it with how you power-up your sheep, Omega, during a run. You start off with a basic weapon and ability, but you unlock other special abilities. After that, you continually beat various enemies to end up taking your pick from their abilities to add to your own as if you're some sort of Borg. So you can end up with some really wild combinations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4104630651758714471gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4104630651758714471gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's all about the loop, repeating runs to learn more about the world and try all the <em>many</em> different combo attacks you can end up doing. Especially once you finish your first run you then see how the game expands, with a starter hub area where you can spend resources you've earned during a run to continue to power up Omega with meta upgrades. The run progression is a bit like Slay the Spire, with a map where you pick nodes to travel between with each being a different encounter.</p>
<p>The actual levels where you fight are a bit small though, especially compared with the sprawling areas in Dead Cells and others similar. Lots of enemies at the same time too, it gets to the point that it becomes a lot more of a button-masher as you're just trying to mass-damage enemies as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>So it is perhaps a bit more like Skul: The Hero Slayer than Dead Cells. Not a bad thing, the combat is a <em>lot</em> of fun once you've gone through and built up the special combo attacks because it's a real flashy spectacle. Landing hit after hit, leading into your special attacks one after the other with combos you've built through the run. That's the good stuff right there.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_JTGLLfVN8w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fd96d37c4873d7dfded88fd10e278633.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_JTGLLfVN8w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:justify">Made by Korean indie team LIFUEL, it's impressive work for two people. A spokesperson for the LIFUEL team said: "We know this isn’t a battle a single sheep can win, but we hope you will. Our love for pixel-action is shown in every element, from the detailed backdrops to the satisfying combat. Ovis Loop is the culmination of four years of hard work".</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Step into the dark sci-fi world as Omega, a robotic sheep on a mission to repel the wolf threat.</li>
<li>Face diverse packs of wolves, each with distinct attacks, skills, and behaviours.</li>
<li>Embrace your inner hacker by downloading skills from fallen enemies and adapting them to suit your needs as you see fit.</li>
<li>Experience richly detailed pixel art that brings the sci-fi world of Ovis Loop to life, inspired by classic sci-fi aesthetics.</li>
<li>Enjoy full keyboard and controller support, including customizable keybindings to suit your preferred playstyle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love games like Dead Cells, Skul: The Hero Slayer and other action-roguelikes this should be an absolute no-brainer to pick up. Very impressed with all parts of this one. I've been thoroughly enjoying my time with it and I'm seriously looking forward to the added content planned for it.</p>
<p>It's currently 20% off on Steam until September 29th. It works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

In the game you have to manage various stats like your health, energy and stress levels as you try to make a new start in a world consumed by war.</p>

      <title>Like a creepy version of hide and seek, It Has My Face is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creepy stuff. It Has My Face makes you seek out your clone amongst the crowd, like some sort of hide and seek but with a real sinister vibe. The problem is, your clone wants to kill you. So you have to kill them first.</p>
<p>To help you deal with the situation you have to scavenge for weapons, although you only get limited ammo. Did you fail? Well tough luck, you're easier to spot now. And something about biological horrors, with you finding more about what's going on and new threats as the game progresses.</p>
<p>It's a really clever stealthy-action horror spin on hide and seek and looks to be a really fun time, and with the Early Access release they've even added in 1v1 online multiplayer! The release also has more story chapters and an endless invasion mode too compared to the demo.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>It was originally called DoubleWe, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/kill-your-clone-before-they-find-you-in-doublewe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered here on GamingOnLinux</a> with the very early demo back in 2024. The new name is much better, and with a publisher it seems they were able to make it even better from the original idea.</p>
<p>Early Access won't last too long for this one, as the developer said they think it will take three to six months to finish it up. During this time they plan to finish the story, add more enemy types, new multiplayer modes and so on.</p>
<p>It Has My Face is available with Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. It's Verified with the Native version (not Proton).</p>

      <title>A shotgun for an arm, boomer shooter Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation arrives in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A retro styled boomer shooter where you have a shotgun for an arm. Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation is confirmed to launch on November 25th. The developer also mentions how it's half game, half cartoon as there's a whole lot of animated cutscenes to go along with the action.</p>
<p>More about it: "Stranded on Orca Isle after a brutal ambush, Wayne’s vacation plans have gone straight to Davy Jones’ locker. Now it’s all-out war against the ruthless mercenary gang known as the Killer Whales. From chain-gun fingers to explosive Boom Brew, fruity-but-deadly coconuts to bone-crunching fists, Wayne’s arsenal ensures the only thing deeper than the ocean will be the enemy body count."</p>
<p>With the release date announced, a brand new refreshed demo has also been released.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KdZUmVNi39k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/03587a71ba1194853a88b82f95ebe019.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KdZUmVNi39k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brutal, stylized cartoon gore-fest, because who said bloodshed can’t be beautiful?</li>
<li>8 massive, enemy-packed zones across treacherous Orca Isle.</li>
<li>An arsenal of absurdly over-the-top weapons, fine-tuned for maximum mayhem.</li>
<li>A relentlessly chaotic soundtrack, louder than a storm at sea.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn, fully-voiced cinematics that bring Wayne’s twisted quest to life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the demo only has a Windows build (runs with Proton), it seems the actual main store page does list Linux support and it's made with GZDoom. So either way, you'll be able to play this one on Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Monster taming roguelite Aethermancer from the devs of Monster Sanctuary now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More monster taming goodness for you today, as Aethermancer from Monster Sanctuary developer moi rai games is now in Early Access with Linux support.</p>
<p>The monsters defied the virtues of this world and are trapped in a cycle of death and rebirth. Players become the Aethermancer and fight their way through the procedurally generated Fractured Ruins alongside these mythical creatures. The game combines creature collecting, turn-based combat and the roguelite formula to let you build your own powerful team of monsters. Use your powers (and your mythical friends) to win strategic 3v3 turn-based battles, defy death, and escape the fractured ruins.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the design on their previous game Monster Sanctuary, especially the sound design and this looks like they've really upped the production values on it to make something even better. So far it's rated Very Positive on Steam. Valve also gave it a Steam Deck Verified rating with the default being the Native Linux version of the game (not Proton).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recruit and tame mythical monsters to fight at your side.</li>
<li>Upgrade unique elemental skills for each monster.</li>
<li>Plan ahead to win strategic turn-based 3v3 battles.</li>
<li>Explore a gorgeous procedurally generated world.</li>
<li>Unlock new player classes and bend the rules.</li>
<li>Monsters – and you – grow stronger with each new life.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Your only weapon is a deadly bouncing ball in Sydless - check out the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A first-person baller? Sydless has a fun idea with you repeatedly punching a deadly bouncing ball around rooms to take down enemies. For the Boomstock festival on Steam, the game has a demo now available and it works great with Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>More about it: "As Diego, a late ’90s fast-food worker trapped in a twisted anomaly at Randy’s Burger, you’ll face warped customers, shifting environments, and a reality spiralling out of control."</p>
<p>Sydless turns every room into a blender, arming players with a high-speed bouncing ball that grows faster and deadlier the more you punch it. The speed of it gets quite intense, with you being able to momentarily stop the ball to punch it again and give it a little aim. Quite a silly idea but it somehow works.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IamCDXe3uOw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/302ae52ede4b4e07f16655aea0dc45a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IamCDXe3uOw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo that's now live gives you a slice of the first chapter. This has several levels and unlockable powers, and a local ranking system.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bouncing Ball Combat:</strong> Master the art of controlling a deadly bouncing ball! The more you punch it, the faster and deadlier it becomes. Turn every room into a chaotic battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Fast-Paced Movement:</strong> Wall-jump, Slide, Dash, Ground Slam and punch your way through shifting environments. Precision and speed are key to survival.</li>
<li><strong>Reality-Bending World In the ‘90s:</strong> Navigate through Randy's Burger, a failed fast-food restaurant in the late ‘90s trapped in an endless anomaly, each room more twisted than the last.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Skill System:</strong> Unlock new powers across four chapters, adding depth to your combat and movement.</li>
<li><strong>Ranking System:</strong> Each level tracks your speed, skill, and efficiency. Climb the leaderboard and master every stage!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve revamps the Steam store menu with enhanced searching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since July and previously only in the Steam Client, Valve have released the refresh of the Steam store menu with enhanced search. Now on the web store too, not just the client - everyone has it.</p>
<p>It's more compact, with rearranged options and it will appear again when you scroll up a little. Giving you easy access to a few recommendations, your discovery queue to find new games, Steam hardware and more. The enhanced search is the real highlight here though. When you go to search for something now it will show a box with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular Searches</strong>: See what others are searching for right now</li>
<li><strong>Recently Viewed</strong>: An easy way to jump back to games you've previously looked at</li>
<li><strong>More than just games</strong>: Search for categories/tags, publishers, and more</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Search link</strong>: For those who want to refine their game search even further, we’ve made it easier than ever to access the advanced search page with a variety of filters.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gets a Native Linux version to improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian have just released a fresh update for Baldur's Gate 3, which brings a Native Linux version made for the Steam Deck. I mentioned they were doing this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/valve-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-issue-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a recent GamingOnLinux article</a> talking about an issue it had and now it's here.</p>
<p>Originally, it used Proton to run the Windows version (like a lot of games) but Larian say with the new Native version it should result in a "more stable framerate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>Additionally, the work they put into this update benefits <em>everyone</em> as they said you should see "overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3".</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, you won't lose any saves with the move, as long as your Steam Cloud is up to date. Larian also put up a <a href="https://larian.com/support/faqs/steam-deck-native-version_121" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated guide</a> for the transition to the new version. In short: if you wish to change it over before Valve re-run it through verification to swap it, go into the game Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the "Force..." box and select "Steam Linux Runtime". <em>Although, that should already be done by Valve.</em></p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux support, Larian gave a definitive no on that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Now that there is a Steam Deck Native build, is Baldur’s Gate 3 supported on Linux?</strong></p>
<p>Larian does not provide support for the Linux platform. The Steam Deck Native build is only supported on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll refrain from moaning about the Steam Deck being treated like it's <em>not</em> Linux. But I get what they're saying, this is specifically for the Steam Deck as a device with SteamOS Linux. For all other Linux systems from PCs to different handhelds, you'll want to stick with Proton.</p>
<p>The issue for Desktop Linux is a bit confusing. Larian has set this for Linux + Steam Deck, so right now the Native Linux version will <em>only</em> download on Steam Deck and leave Desktop Linux with a broken empty download (or broken update if you had it installed already). You will need to manually force Proton until this is solved. I sent a <a href="http://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/12344" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> to Valve on it. <strong>Update: 20:21 UTC</strong> - looks like this has been fixed and it now downloads on Desktop Linux. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9647349971758642710gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p>Speaking on X, Larian's Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1970526548592623969" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story of how this came to be really is one of true passion. The Steam Deck native build was initiated by a single engineer who really wanted a smoother version of the game on Steam Deck and so he started working on it after hours. When we tried it out, we were all surprised by how good it felt and so it didn't take much to convince us to put our shoulders behind it and get it released. It's this type of pure passion for their craft that makes me fall in love with my developers over and over again. Considering myself very lucky to have people like him on my team. Try it out!"</p>

      <title>3rd person action roguelite mech-builder Granvir is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Granvir brings solo and online co-op to mech-building, with Linux support it's officially available today and it's great. They also previously released Granvir: Zero Front, a standalone cut-down version for you to try for free to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>More about it: pilot your Granvir and manage your campaign between battles to find the best equipment and stay supplied while fighting back against the Millennium Company invasion of Inheritance in single-player or with friends in multiplayer co-op. You can end up building some pretty fun mechs in it, a bit of a dream for fans of things like Gundam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HNXPPHE4SL4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/beac91b4b68d8823103d3c5f6e242c17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HNXPPHE4SL4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equip An Arsenal Of Deadly Weapons: </strong>Don devastating melee weapons such as swords, rocket spears, and jaw arms. In addition you can wield powerful long range guns like cannons, machine guns, flamethrowers and rockets. Mix and match them to suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Your Granvir Your Way:</strong> Mix arms, legs, armatures, and special modules to customize your mech. Defeating ace pilots grants their unique parts for your use.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy With Friends: </strong>Complete any campaign in single-player or multiplayer co-op with up to 10 Granvir pilots at a time. Share parts and resources utilizing the squad depot in rest areas as you plan your next moves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct The Campaign:</strong> No campaign is the same as you manage time, resources, and your route to each objective. Each zone dictates what services and resources are available to you. Use down time between missions to refit and upgrade your Granvir to prevail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A whole bunch of content is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2743460/view/542243094205040437" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">planned</a> post-release including a new story campaign, new mission environments, more parts for your mechs, new enemies and much more.</p>
<p>I played quite a lot of Granvir: Zero Front and really enjoyed the mech building in it. Really pleases my brain to see more mech games appearing lately that are actually <em>good</em>. Still nice to see games releasing with direct Native Linux support too, hopefully it continues working well.</p>

      <title>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally gets night vision and more upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Going back to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is probably going to feel like quite a different game, and that actually excites me again.</p>
<p>They just released another major free upgrade for the game finally adding in night vision goggles, along with some other gameplay enhancements. This was one of my major requests to add, so I'm pleased to see it made it in. There's also offset aiming, a laser pointer, updates to the combat systems, NPCs can loot mutants noew, a new Fireball anomaly, controller improvements, a save backup and restore option, new face and hair options for female characters, improved modding support and lots of fixes to the game overall.</p>

      <title>A first look at the spooky game OD from KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we don't yet know when it will release or come to Steam, OD from KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS and Xbox Game Studios looks freaky as heck. Given Microsoft's push to put more games on PC, I've no doubt it will eventually pop up on Steam after release. </p>
<p>It's nice to see more from it, although we still don't entirely know what exactly it will be, other than some form of horror. KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS are getting help from Microsoft on this one, with Xbox's Phil Spencer on stage during their livestream saying: "OD is bold, it's unique and it's unmistakably from this studio. Which is just incredible. We're deeply supporting the production, it's our technical work on Unreal that we're doing with the team, both with the flashy <em>[features]</em> you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind the scenes work. We have one goal in mind, which is to bring Kojima's vision to life for all players everywhere."</p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eHCqxLtwy5g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1919774f8debe81b12a90ae807019a4c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An interesting choice to go with Unreal Engine for it, switching away from the Sony-owned Decima game engine, with Kojima noting how Unreal Engine tech is "one step higher than Death Stranding 2".</p>
<p><em>Now if we could just get Sony to put Death Stranding 2 finally on PC I'll be happy.</em></p>

      <title>Comedy first-person adventure The Dungeon Experience from Devolver Digital gets a demo and new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Dungeon Experience is a comedy first-person adventure about a low-level mudcrab helping to bring you the true bliss of Financial Freedom. <em>Whatever the heck that actually means.</em></p>
<p>One of the developers, Jacob Janerka, previously made the quirky and funny adventure game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600370/Paradigm/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paradigm</a> which I'm a big fan of. Knowing their humour, this is going to be a good one. With Devolver Digital publishing, I have high hopes for the quality of it too.</p>
<p>From the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lowly crab started life as a humble crustacean scraping by at the bottom of the food chain, a low level RPG monster, but now – thanks to determination, optimism, and a modest investment in crab scented essential oil candles – he’s the proud owner of a fully featured, highly desirable dungeon, now confirmed to have asbestos all removed. </p>
<p>And he wants to share this life-changing opportunity with YOU!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="im4DtyULXSo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/04a58041340a0f2c474233c6ef672819.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/im4DtyULXSo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Yep, that was definitely marketing for something. Funny though.</p>
<p>More from the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step inside the dungeon, explore its wonders, and take part in an exclusive training program that will guide you to success</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never seen before techniques of teaching business acumen via high fantasy themes. Who knew murdering goblins could lead to such wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training program will increase your chance with prospective partners of your choosing whether that be romantic, platonic or George. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rise through the ranks of a supportive, fast-growing community who are ready to synergise and touch base with other like minded touchers of bases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be able to pass down the success you earn onto others and reap the benefits of their success, creating a pyramid adjacent shape of Financial Freedom*</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Financial Freedom</em></strong><em>* Is a trademark owned by the Dungeon Experience and is not representative of owning government mandated “currency” and is open to interpretation. “Open to interpretation” is open to interpretation, and we’d rather you not interpret it at all, consider interpreting yourself instead, of how much spare time you have to interpret things you should not be. We in fact have interpreted you as a ‘person who is poor with no friends’ and would very much benefit from our exclusive training to be not those things.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely one you're going to need to play to get the idea of it. Thankfully it should work great on Linux with Proton.</p>

      <title>Pocketpair announced farming life sim spin-off Palworld: Palfarm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have to be trolling Nintendo and The Pokémon Company at this point, with the announcement of Palworld: Palfarm.</p>
<p>Not just because of the ongoing lawsuit over Palworld versus Pokémon but little over a week ago, Nintendo only just revealed Pokémon Pokopia, their own blend of Pokémon with a life sim and now we have Pocketpair doing something very similar.</p>
<p>Just watch, Nintendo will now probably attempt to patent some kind of mechanics included in Pokémon Pokopia like they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/nintendo-get-another-problematic-patent-in-their-fight-against-palworld-for-summoning-characters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doing with another problematic patent</a>. They won't, probably not anyway, especially given the masses of prior art on it but never say never when it comes to Nintendo.</p>
<p>No release date has been revealed yet for Palfarm but it's not lost on me that Pocketpair are announcing a new game, with two others still in Early Access. One of which, Craftopia, has been in Early Access for over five years at this point. Hopefully they will actually finish it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Palfarm trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AmurGwwjvGM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6658cacbd2e77e64254f510549eac20.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AmurGwwjvGM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Must admit, I do actually like the look of this one. And with online co-op as well, it might turn into a great one to play with friends. Love how they blended a very cosy vibe and then suddenly – creepy person playing russian roulette? And then back to being cosy on the beach and rolling snowballs and all sorts. And then right at the end, the suddenly sinister vibe returns of catching a Pal that wants just to be friends. Okay then.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move to an island where the Pals live, work together to till the fields, cook, craft, and build the farm of your dreams.</p>
<p>Each Pal will lend a hand in farm work by making use of their unique abilities. From sowing seeds and watering to harvesting, Pals make for reliable partners. Deepen your relationships with the island residents and Pals through daily conversation and gift-giving, and you may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding.</p>
<p>At times, you’ll also need to defend your farm from some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc. Head to the market, buy and sell crops or crafted goods, and sometimes even obtain rare items. Of course, multiplayer is also supported, so you can build your farm life together with friends.</p>
<p>A cosy life is waiting for you with your Pals!</p>

      <title>Deadly Days: Roadtrip brings inventory management to survivor-likes and it&#39;s damn good</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending inventory management with a zombies horde-based road trip bullet heaven, Deadly Days Roadtrip is a delight. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Once again taking the mechanics popularised by Vampire Survivors, but with a fresh spin on it that’s a bit more like Death Road to Canada mixed with backpack management found in the likes of Backpack Hero. All together, that’s a lot of “it’s like this but also this” so I’ll attempt to break it down a little more for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2500414321758627615gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2500414321758627615gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadly Days: Roadtrip on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu)</em></p>
<p>You start off in a basic camp with nothing but your bus. So off you pop, and pick a location to run around and loot in. Each location to pick has a different map size, general loot amount and amount of fuel you can find. In the locations you run around while your character auto-fires (you can manually aim like a twin-stick too), and you pick up experience gems from dead zombies. When you level up you auto-throw a flare and after a short delay along comes a little care package. This is where the real hook is!</p>
<p>Inside the package you get to pick an item. This could be a power-up item, a new weapon, a gadget of some sort or more slots to build your backpack to get more space to add even more into it next time.</p>
<p>The inventory management alone is quite a challenge. You can initially only wield two main weapons (like guns or bats and knives), as after all - you’re only human. Each weapon takes up 1 or 2 slots, for single or double-handed. It’s how you arrange that inventory that matters due to the many different additional items that can stack upgrades onto weapons. Like a lighter that can add burning to ammo to set zombies ablaze. All these extra items have specific backpack slots they affect, so that’s where you have to rearrange everything to fit and synergise together.</p>

<p>Eventually, you might be able to stack some more weapons if you’re lucky enough to find the legendary Robot Arm. However, this is <em>inventory Tetris</em>, and so the arm takes up valuable backpack space too. Decisions - decisions, making room for it is the obvious choice of course. Who doesn't love more weapons?</p>

<p>Another fun bit is that you can drop the same weapon on top of another, and it will level them up to make them more powerful too. The game doesn’t actually tell you that though, and it took me a while to even realise as it just does a small arrow animation over the same weapons that I entirely missed for a while. Easy to miss when you’re not looking for it. Nice to have but one small bit they should explain better.</p>
<p>There is a point to exploring these locations too as you need to find more fuel to feed your bus to continue on your journey to the next destination. The longer you stay to get as much loot as you can, the more challenging it gets and it can end up pretty brutal. As soon as you have enough fuel to leave, you can make a run for your bus - but that can at times be insanely tough. Especially if you overstayed your welcome.</p>
<p>There’s a nice mixture of enemy types from the mindless walkers, to some that will dash as you, throw up some toxic stuff your way and more. I've lost count of the amount of times I've died in it, often due to my own stupidity but the later exploration is a true challenge.</p>
<p>You also get stopped along the way with special levels that interrupt your trip. Here you get a smaller map with specific objectives like clearing actual roadblocks or taking down specific enemies, like the shot below where you have to take down Titans, much bigger and tougher enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170730471758625525gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170730471758625525gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadly Days: Roadtrip on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>At first you think it’s a bit light on content, then you finish your first run and realise that’s just the start. Back to camp you go, and new things have appeared. Like a crafting table, that allows you to unlock more for your future runs like new items, a merchant, an item workbench to craft new items and much more.</p>
<p>It’s in your camp where you can now also do character upgrades. Depending on how long you survive you get apples, a currency to boost your stats like max HP and attack speed.</p>
<p>As fun as it is, I think they’re playing it perhaps a bit <em>too safe</em>. Or maybe <em>plain</em> is the better word here? I would love to see them play with the absurdity of a zombie apocalypse a bit more. You can see a small glimpse of it at times, like when you get a powerup from a box that explodes zombies on death for 30 seconds. Or the little bits of map destruction already in that they could really amplify. You can destroy a few select items on the map - I want lots more like that for it.</p>
<p>The game has only just begun life, and I expect it’s going to be another big indie hit during its time in Early Access. Incredibly keen to see where they take it. Already more polished and fun than a lot of finished games.</p>
<p>Good performance on Steam Deck too and it works great out of the box. Valve, weirdly, gave it only a Playable rating noting various issues that just don't seem to exist. This <em>should</em> be a <strong>Verified</strong> game as far as I can see. I've put almost all of my hours into it on Steam Deck. No issues to report on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) either, it works very nicely.</p>
<p>It tickles the happy part of my brain. A properly fun blend of things. I love turning a big horde into zombie confetti when I’ve really juiced my weapons with fancy items after spending 15 minutes sorting my bag.</p>
<p>That is until I die for the 5th time in a row, but then that itch comes back and I need another run to scratch it. And another run I will have, often, to the point that my total hours in it shocked even me. Where does time go?</p>
<p>Great stuff, you should go grab it.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes DualSense crash on Linux / SteamOS and improves game recording with Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small Beta update for Desktop PCs, SteamOS and Steam Deck for the Steam Client to fix up some more annoying problems.</p>
<p>For Desktop here's the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545620793932908810?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved High Contrast view of game list search and app filter panel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved performance when recording is on for some games using Vulkan rendering</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when DualSense controllers are connected and idle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam Deck / SteamOS update also just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/498332997840275674" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> the DualSense fix, since it's a Linux issue. Nice to see that solved.</p>
<p>It's currently in Beta / Preview so you need to opt into receiving it before it rolls out into the Stable channel for all Steam users. Another recent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/502836144430384152?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Beta update</a> also put Windows 10 32bit on notice, as Valve will be removing 32bit support for Windows soon. Hopefully at some point we may also eventually see a 64 bit client for Linux too.</p>

      <title>Grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB for cheap as Valve gave it a discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just put the Steam Deck LCD 256GB on sale, so you can get ready for the upcoming Steam Autumn Sale ahead of time with some new hardware.</p>
<p>While the Steam Autumn Sale doesn't start until September 29th, right now you can go ahead and grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model with 20% off. This discount on the Steam Deck will run from now all the way through the Steam Autumn Sale until October 6th. So there's no hurry, but stocks also do tend to fly whenever Valve put the Steam Deck on a discount.</p>
<p>That makes it only £279.20 / $319.20, which is an absolutely <em>ridiculous</em> bargain for what you actually get. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-deck-and-steamos-hit-20000-playable-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 20,000 games playable on it</a>, you're sure to find plenty to love about it. Just be sure to also keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>, and our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growing list of tips and guides</a>.</p>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a> to buy one.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm actually going right back to playing on my Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Megabonk is Risk of Rain 2 fused with Vampire Survivors and it&#39;s glorious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An unholy fusion of Risk of Rain 2 with Vampire Survivors is what you'll find with Megabonk and it absolutely freaking rocks. Seriously, this is some glorious and delicious stuff that you don't want to miss out on. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>You pick a character and then jump into a randomly generated map. Run around with auto-firing weapons, pick up experience gems and pick a random level up boost to keep powering up your character. You know the drill by now. However, with it being in 3D, it adds some fun flavour to it. Not just because you can run, jump and slide about - but the characters are just plain silly too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9h5eUbIXg-M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8869d3e5c19874736caf348785646dc9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9h5eUbIXg-M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Risk of Rain 2 spice, there's various chests spread around you can buy to open to pull out special relics as well. The general setup of it just really feels like RoR2 blended with Vampire Survivors and anyone who has played both will be quite familiar. Run around as long as you can, fight bosses and just keep on going.</p>
<p>It really leans into the comedy too, not just on the silly descriptions and items, but the fact that I can slide all the way down a hill on a sword while all my abilities fire off — it's so satisfying and dumb you can't help but love it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21293113681758548951gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21293113681758548951gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of developers have tried to replicate the success of Vampire Survivors, and only a few have managed to actually carve out their own place in a now very crowded genre. Megabonk thankfully feels fresh enough that I'm willing to spend hours of my personal time playing it. Being in full 3D really gives them more leverage, like how one unlock you can get is to add more jumps and so eventually you'll be leaping across the map over enemies and obstacles high up in the sky. It's so fun to find all the weird combinations you can add together.</p>
<p>The maps are littered with some funny characters to find and interact with, and in some cases rescue. There's a shady guy to buy upgrades from, a microwave that will magically clone a relic you've acquired and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6011147861758550806gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6011147861758550806gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it has 240 in-game quests, 20 characters with unique abilities, over 70 items all with their own different synergies and more to discover.</p>
<p>Out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. Megabonk is just pure stupid joy to play. The Linux version has been running very nicely too.</p>
<p>It's going to take over my life. I fully expect it to be a huge success, and I hope so because I want to see this have a long life with lots of additions. What's there is fantastic but I want more, lots and lots more from it. Early indicators are it doing well, with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and it hit over 21,068 people playing recently.</p>

      <title>Cute casual sandbox room designer MakeRoom makes lots of Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer Kenney (who makes lots of assets for game developers), MakeRoom is a cute sandbox building game all about building rooms to look sweet. Released back in August, it's gone onto receiving a Very Positive overall rating from users on Steam.</p>

      <title>Need more metroidvania action? Stardust Demon is an overlooked gem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finished Hollow Knight: Silksong? Didn't find it punishing enough? You should really take a look at Stardust Demon. An overlooked gem with some pretty rad looking design, and a game that just keeps on expanding as you go through it. I was quite shocked to see it only had 67 user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it: Stardust Demon is a Cave Story-inspired metroidvania with an emphasis on its world's story and cute characters, and challenges that ramp up in difficulty including precision platforming elements. The aesthetic of the game uniquely combines colourful pixel-art with retro FMV cutscenes. Its eclectic soundtrack melds chip-tune, electronica, and metal influences together. </p>
<p>It originally released back in October 2024, and last month they added a major upgrade including a new Boss Rush game mode. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="23a9R62-YLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a03b16ca576ba41ea2e5ae5f517bb7a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/23a9R62-YLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support, and on Steam Deck it's rated Playable (need you to manually change resolution). If you can handle the difficulty, if you love a proper challenge - it's one not to be missed.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mixture of platforming, action, and puzzle gameplay.</li>
<li>Exploring multiple planets.</li>
<li>Weird and wonderful NPC's, rich and vibrant worlds.</li>
<li>Shops and optional quests.</li>
<li>Cutscenes with charming sprite animations.</li>
<li>Puzzles with varied mechanics including teleporting, reversing time for specific platforms, and more.</li>
<li>Many secrets and upgrades to be found.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Scribbly adventure Scrabdackle looks fantastic with a new trailer and demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scrabdackle is an action adventure I've been excited about for years, and now it has a proper fresh trailer along with a big demo upgrade.</p>
<p>What is it: Scrabdackle is a sprawling, scribbly adventure that blends exploration, challenge, with genuine joy. Players take on the role of novice wizard Blue, flung from the safety of the academy into a vast, hand-animated world full of secrets, tough-but-fair bosses, curious creatures, and a journey home that's anything but straightforward.</p>
<p>During the  Six One Indie Showcase it had a new trailer show up:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QzBF0ZH8qqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cce0c79581b8080e6d92f306b2896fcf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QzBF0ZH8qqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Act I will arrive sometime later this year with it in Early Access. Until then, you can try the demo which was refreshed with all these changes listed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1578720/view/499458897750261919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More readable fonts (larger sizes, better character differentiation),</li>
<li>A new "taskroll" quest menu replacing the one that, uh, no one knew was there or how to use (it was kind of hidden in the minimap),</li>
<li>Completion/collectible tracking per-region (via the taskroll),</li>
<li>Notifications for when quests are started and completed, and better tagging for when a quest will continue in the full game,</li>
<li>A huge performance/optimization pass that should be pretty clear to see the gains of for anyone who played the previous build,</li>
<li>Speaker tags indicating the name of who's speaking, and a conversation log in the pause menu,</li>
<li>Controller support (finally! - although, I do want to tune it more as feedback comes in),</li>
<li>A pretty substantial batch of misc QOL features,</li>
<li>Aaand a general fresh coat of polish on like, everything.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The story-driven Roguelike RPG &#39;Blanksword&#39; looks absolutely rad with a wild setting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes I come across a game that really just immediately jumps out at me as something that could be special, and Blanksword is one of those times. I'm getting some vibes from Undertale, DELTARUNE for this, just a little anyway.</p>
<p>What is it: Blanksword is a Roguelike RPG with strategic turn-based battles, a rich layered story, and a one of a kind brain management system. Enter a land full of dangers as BLANK, an amnesiac wandering Angel, and come to the aid of those that were wronged by God’s cruel law.</p>
<p>The setting of it is what really pulled me in, as it really does sound unique and interesting. Be sure to check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UmOtTNW1mAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c17cdf61c7b6e5182dd1169ff82ff7a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UmOtTNW1mAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/283910083/blanksword/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the developer hoping to raise €48,000 by October 17th. There's also a demo on Steam. Officially, they'll be supporting Windows so you can run it with Proton but they did say "ideally" they want to launch it for other platforms like Linux and macOS officially too.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with 15+ Brain Parts with game-changing properties.</li>
<li>Explore various regions such as a mushroom forest, a sprawling radio tower or moldy apartments.</li>
<li>Fight against a large panel of enemies, each with unique attacks and behaviors.</li>
<li>Customize your loadout each run with 150+ attacks &amp; skills that can fit into any playstyle.</li>
<li>Get to know a rich cast of well-fleshed out characters.</li>
<li>Beat challenges ranging from precise platforming to fight arenas and races against the clock.</li>
<li>Strengthen yourself between runs with permanent upgrades.</li>
<li>Line your pockets as you complete tasks… but not too much: in Blanksword, money is a curse!</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a delay due to Hollow Knight: Silksong, the hilarious looking physics walking sim Baby Steps is Steam Deck Verified for the new September 23rd launch.</p>
<p>This really does look like an absolute gem and I can't wait. I actually adored the challenge of the travel system in Death Stranding with you falling over plenty - and this looks like it turns things up quite a lot. The whole idea and setting of the game just looks completely absurd, to the point that one of the videos publisher Devolver Digital put up recently is how the game has a…breast milk slide — yes, that's a thing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SroBK1KwpEI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad2af61eb03ac92d15647e2c254f40e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SroBK1KwpEI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Every bit of footage of this game makes me confused, in the best possible way. It really does seem hilarious. The highlights of it make me laugh too, like how it has a "Fully dynamic onesie soilage system", just how dirty can one man on a walk get?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play as Nate, an unemployed failson with nothing going for him, until one day he discovers a power he never knew he had… putting one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Explore a world shrouded in mist, one step at a time. Hike the serene mountains by placing each footstep yourself, in original physics-based gameplay from the minds behind Ape Out and Getting Over It. Take in the sights, fall in love with the local fauna, and try to find meaning in a wasted life.</p>
<p>Get ready to fall for Nate, in Baby Steps, a literal walking simulator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Need to know more? Well, here's 10 minutes of falling in Baby Steps:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully-simulated physics based walking.</li>
<li>A world that seems to come alive with a dynamic soundtrack built up out of four hundred and twenty beats and vibes.</li>
<li>A lengthy trek up a mountain-sized mountain that you can explore at your own pace, or slower.</li>
<li>Fully dynamic onesie soilage system.</li>
<li>Non-collectible hats.</li>

      <title>Exciting train combat deckbuilder roguelite Fogpiercer gets a new trailer and publisher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fogpiercer was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/build-a-train-to-expand-your-deck-and-fight-off-bandits-in-the-demo-for-fogpiercer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlight here on GamingOnLinux back in April</a>, and now it's coming back stronger with a brand new trailer and they've found a publisher.</p>
<p>What is it? A deckbuilder roguelite in which you build and upgrade your train to build your deck, fight off bandits on a square grid using unique carriage cards. Combat here is all about positioning, with you able to trick enemies into hitting each other or smashing them off the grid. It's releasing sometime in 2026 with Linux support and a demo is still available right now.</p>
<p>On Steam they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3219010/view/515221496441865362" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that Hooded Horse who published Manor Lords, Norland, Old World and more have become their partner on it. From the announcement the developer said: "This is a huge pickup for us, and we’re really looking forward to having Hooded Horse’s support as we make Fogpiercer the best game it can be. With their resources, we’ll be able to localize the game into more languages, reach a wider audience, have additional QA support, and spend more time actually developing the game!"</p>
<p>Check out the shiny new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OuEIQH6AsCU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83907b4cae05e53313f5a1f7f67dc41b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OuEIQH6AsCU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Fogpiercer has a great setting and innovative train-based gameplay, we think fans of roguelike deckbuilders are going to love this one,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “We're honored to be serving as their publisher."</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Please make it stop - Google Chrome to be reimagined with AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A break from the usual gaming news to moan about Google for a moment, thanks to their new blog post we have a glimpse of the future of Chrome and it's AI AI AI.</p>
<p>Google say they're about to take a step that will result in "fundamentally changing the nature of browsing" to move from a "passive experience to a more proactive and intelligent one". With that they've announced some major changes will be coming to Chrome.</p>
<p>The first is Gemini, their AI assistant, it's going to be your new "browsing assistant" that will "answer questions about articles, find references within YouTube videos, and will soon be able to help you find pages you’ve visited so you can pick up exactly where you left off" and it will integrate with other Google services.</p>
<p>On top of that they're planning to make "more advanced agentic capabilities for Gemini in Chrome that can perform multi-step tasks for you from start to finish". Difficult things like "booking a haircut" or "ordering your weekly groceries" will be a thing of the past Google hope, as they'll get their AI to do it for you.</p>
<p>Another change will be to the address bar, their "omnibox", as it's going to get "even smarter" with their new AI Mode.</p>
<p>Although, they only mention Windows and macOS for this in the post, no doubt it would come to Linux <em>eventually</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WjOvZ8n9MK0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78bf9c01dd8c77f3d711743cf56d50e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WjOvZ8n9MK0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More info across their <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-reimagined-with-ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> and another <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on some of the features.</p>
<p>So soon, you'll be told to add glue to pizza right in the address bar in Google Chrome! <em>Because we all know how factually accurate these AI tools are of course, they never ever make things up. </em>And with their AI Mode right in the browser, the idea of course like with AI Mode on Google Search, is to get you to never click away from anything Google. They want you to stay in their products longer, to generate more data and more revenue from you.</p>
<p>Firefox has also started adding in more AI features too, because apparently that's what everyone will be getting whether you like it or not. You simply must become part of the AI machine.</p>
<p>At no point in my entire browsing history have I ever thought - you know what would make this better? AI!</p>
<p>I think it's time I gave Vivaldi another chance, with <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/keep-exploring/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their commitment</a> to keeping things human.</p>

      <title>Frostpunk 2 gets full controller support and should work better on Steam Deck / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios have published a major upgrade for Frostpunk 2, adding in full proper controller support with an adjusted UI to match. This should hopefully make it a lot better on Steam Deck and other SteamOS devices, and anyone doing some couch gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/11-bit-studios-working-on-getting-frostpunk-2-up-to-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in March</a>, 11 bit studios did confirm they wanted to work towards getting it Steam Deck Verified and this seems to be a solid step on that front. It not only gives you a controller styled UI, but they've also added in a new circular menu system that they reimagined from Frostpunk: Console Edition.</p>
<p>Example shots from the developer: </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3603297501758270213gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3603297501758270213gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13493696321758270211gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13493696321758270211gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All the changes are below:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Interface</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implemented full controller support, featuring supporting UI .</li>
<li>Hospitals now display positive district notification when they heal people instead of the side notification.</li>
<li>The number of homeless people is now displayed in the Main District and in the Heatmap overlay.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gameplay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Homeless people now also get sick in addition to dying.</li>
<li>Reduced and delayed the number of deaths among the homeless.</li>
<li>Warm districts cure people directly instead of impacting disease statistics.</li>
<li>Progress generator upgrades now unlock additional levels of heating in districts.</li>
<li>Added a new research for increasing the capacity of Stockpile hubs.</li>
<li>Fixed game freezes on automatic heat allocation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Prologue</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rebalanced the number and rate of people getting sick from cold districts .</li>
<li>Reduced the amount of heat needed to heat districts.</li>
<li>Reduced the maximum number of heat allocation levels from 5 to 3.</li>
<li>Increased the Food in food deposits by 20%.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the Scraps generation rate.</li>
<li>Increased Frostbreaking tile cost from 37 to 40.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Art</strong>
<ul>

<li>Other minor updates to 2D artwork.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other</strong>
<ul>
<li>Various community reported bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition from Survios releases on September 30th and ahead of release Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>This was originally a VR-only game simple called Alien: Rogue Incursion, which is now titled Alien: Rogue Incursion VR. that was released in December 2024. Now it's being remade for flat-screens so that everyone can get in on the action, even if you're on a handheld. A great time for it to release, with Alien: Earth seeing the last episode release next week (which has been a great show in my opinion).</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TF79l6It5fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6b6a7ed333d2b6e2621988cc0752e32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TF79l6It5fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Made for <em>Alien </em>fans. Built for action-horror. Re-envisioned for PC.</p>
<p>Play as rogue Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks in the terrifying first chapter of a two-part saga set between the <em>Alien </em>and <em>Aliens </em>films. Sent to investigate a distress call on the remote planet Purdan, Zula uncovers a secret Weyland-Yutani blacksite overrun by deadly Xenomorphs.</p>
<p>Stalking, hunting, and attacking at every turn, these Xenomorphs' ferocity is matched only by their unpredictability. Aided by your synth companion, Davis 01, fight and survive using your weapons, skills, and sheer determination against a deadly Xenomorph incursion in this gripping original story.</p>
<p>Rebuilt for PC with stunning visuals, 60 fps, 3D audio, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> delivers a cinematic action experience that makes you truly feel like you’re inside the world of <em>Alien</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note, that this is only Part 1 and ends on a cliffhanger. Back when the VR version released, they failed pretty badly on the marketing and had to release a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1850050/view/520826430987174742" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> as it being only the first part was a surprise. Their prior communication on it was pretty poor. If you know it's an episodic game, it should have always been advertised as such. Anyway, hopefully the main PC release goes well so they do actually finish the next part - I would love a new proper Alien game.</p>

      <title>Digimon Story Time Stranger is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Digimon Story Time Stranger was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/digimon-story-time-stranger-rated-steam-deck-playable-steamos-compatible-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously rated Steam Deck Playable</a> but ahead of release this has been improved and it's now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Valve put it back through testing, and it appears the developer has solved the issue of it sometimes showing the wrong keybinds which was the only thing they noted as preventing it being Verified. Great news, as this one is sure to be a popular choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8998986391758268519gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8998986391758268519gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The compatibility notice still mentions it needs an internet connection for the first-time setup, plus it also has Denuvo Anti-Tamper listed on the Steam page.</p>

      <title>Stop Killing Games update - UK petition to see a debate in Parliament</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A short update for you on the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> movement - a UK petition is actually going to Parliament for a real debate.</p>
<p>The UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport did actually reply to the petition <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/uk-gov-responds-to-the-newer-stop-killing-games-petition-no-plans-to-amend-uk-consumer-law/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February 2025</a>, although the response was pretty much what was expected on these sorts of things giving a very wordy answer that basically boiled down to "nothing will change".</p>
<p>However, the petition did cross over the 100,000 threshold (189,888 total) to be <em>considered</em> for a debate in Parliament. Petitions that cross over this number are never <em>guaranteed</em> to see a debate, as they still have to actually be <em>selected</em>. Seems this has been popular enough that it now has been, and a date has been set for November 3rd, 2025 which will be shown on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/UKParliament" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UK Parliament YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprising though, considering the massive push for it in the EU that saw about <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en#" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1,448,270 signatures</a> of support, with the UK still pretty close with the EU some lawmakers have no doubt taken notice of what's going on there.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we'll see a proper adult debate on this, but I know how the UK goes with this sort of thing - but it's progress at least. Let's wait and see what happens. I'm not expecting any big surprises or sweeping changes, but at least the ball is rolling on it.</p>
<p>Really, a lot of this could be sorted by major publishers releasing server files to the community when they move on from games. Just look at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-crew-from-ubisoft-gets-revived-thanks-to-the-the-crew-unlimited-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Crew Unlimited community project</a> to show how it <em>can</em> be done.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are investing $5 billion in Intel to develop new chips together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge announcement for the entire computing industry came today, with NVIDIA and Intel teaming up to make new chips for data centre and consumers too. This is of course, largely about AI, and they want to ensure they stay ahead of AMD and Arm chip makers.</p>
<p>NVIDIA have been wanting to do some proper CPUs for a while, so it's no surprise that with this deal Intel will then be building custom CPUs for NVIDIA to use in data centres. But for personal computing, us normies, Intel plan to build " x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets".</p>
<p>That will be <em>very</em> interesting to see on the desktop, laptop and handheld gaming side. Can you imagine a future Steam Deck 3 that has an Intel CPU with NVIDIA RTX? Sure would be an interesting way for both Intel and NVIDIA to suck up some more of the market from AMD.</p>
<p>Their statements from the press releases:</p>
<p>“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”</p>
<p>“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Intel</a> and <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-intel-to-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a> press releases.</p>
<p>I should note, the deal is not complete yet. They need to go through regulator approval first as usual for such a big deal.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

      <title>Modding-friendly arcade racer Formula Legends is out now - works well on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have the need for speed but don't want to play one of the various full simulators, perhaps Formula Legends might be just the ticket you need. <em>You <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can't even play the latest F1 games on Linux</a> systems anyway.</em></p>
<p>With bright colourful and inviting visuals, this is a game designed for racing fans who find the serious sims just a bit <em>too</em> demanding. Formula Legends is a bit of a weird one though that sits somewhere between an arcade racer and a light simulator, because without any assists on it does feel a bit more like a proper sim but with controls and an overall feel that are a bit more like an arcade game - and when you turn on assists it's very much an arcade racer so you could call it a "sim-cade" racer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3_7zXatQjBA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d21ff87af2cc5add6603e8f7a7c431a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3_7zXatQjBA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the content and gameplay, I don't have a whole lot special to say about it. There's only 3 different game modes split across story mode, time attack and a custom mode where you can set things up how you like. All pretty standard stuff there for such a racer. The vehicles and tracks are only inspired by the real world too, as they don't have the licensing. So with the story mode (which doesn't exactly have any story) you just run through AI races using vehicles inspired by various eras.</p>
<p>Even with the more approachable nature of it, there's still a fair bit you need to keep an eye on when you're burning rubber. It has tyre wear, tyre grip, fuel consumption, damage simulation and weather conditions - all to keep you on your toes. There's even a tiny mini-game when you go into the pit to press a few buttons to get repaired and refuelled. </p>
<p>I really like that they're leaning into the modding community too. While other bigger racers stick in anti-cheat and try to protect their precious micro-transactions and such, this is a single-player modders delight (if a community builds up around to to make some that is). Although, modding support will come "soon" after launch.</p>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 9.0-4 it has been working perfectly, my PC hasn't broken a sweat with all the settings cranked up to max. Not overly surprising though, it's not exactly graphically demanding.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck gamers, even with the details all on "Very High" it will stick to nearly 60FPS. Just turn them down one notch to High and you should be absolutely fine on performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273461791758207802gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273461791758207802gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Formula Legends on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Don't go in expecting <em>any</em> multi-player features at all though, this is firmly designed as a single-player experience. And, honestly, that works against it. The AI drivers are…quite often complete morons. Completely bunching up, smashing into each other in groups around some corners and so on. If you're going to make a pure single-player racer, the AI needs to be better than this.</p>
<p>Aside from the racer stupidity, the actual racing is a real blast. The vehicles sound great, and mostly control great apart from some strange quirks at times with the handling. Soaring past opponents, and then attempting to stay on the track as I'm going way too fast for the corner. It's a challenge that still surprised me given the inviting nature of the game.</p>
<p>From the developer: </p>
<p>"We’ve all poured our hearts and souls into Formula Legends’ development," said Francesco Bruschi, CEO of 3DClouds. "We have been blown away by the positive response to the game from media, content creators and players, with launch being just the next step for us."</p>
<p>"We’ve designed Formula Legends to be fully mod-able - from the smallest in-game livery logo to entire car models and more," Bruschi added. "The PC version of Formula Legends can be easily decompiled and recompiled allowing the community to mod, tweak and create whatever they want and share their efforts with others. We can’t wait to see what they create!"</p>
<p>They have some big post-release plans too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Just a few days after launch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free update With Minor Fix and Custom Configurations (MOD) available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>October</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free update including <strong>bug fixes</strong>, various improvements, and new features such as the <strong>Custom Camera (Cockpit)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>November</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Double free update with new features currently in development, including <strong>wheel support</strong> and <strong>manual gearbox</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>December</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Release of the first seasonal <strong>“Early ‘10” DLC</strong>, featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New teams and drivers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 new vehicle models</p>
</li>
<li>A new chapter of the <strong>Story Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall it's a fun time if you're in the market for a new racer that's hard to pin down where it belongs. Just keep in mind it's single-player only and the AI racers do need some tweaks to not be so stupid.</p>
<p>You're not going to be making your wallet cry with this one either at £19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99.</p>

      <title>Alabaster Dawn from the devs of CrossCode has a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radical Fish Games known for the awesome CrossCode have just put a demo for their next action-RPG with Alabaster Dawn now available to test.</p>
<p>Quite a unique demo because it's split across two parts. The first is the beginning of the game, and your save will carry on to the full game. The second part as an extra skips ahead to showcase a number of other game features along with a part of a dungeon. They say it should give 1.5 - 2.5 hours of play time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hL1zcGLwxG4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5541f54a40afc97f71fc9570c2ab9d1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hL1zcGLwxG4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alabaster Dawn</strong> is an Action RPG building on top of the best aspects of Radical Fish Games' previous title <strong>CrossCode</strong>, featuring a deep and engaging combat system, challenging puzzles and an epic story set in a curious world full of secrets to discover and places to explore.<br/>
<br/>
The shadow of Nyx has fallen, warping the world into a wasteland and vanishing the gods and their people. Now, Juno, the Outcast Chosen, awakens to an impossible task: <em>bring it all back.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>A (planned) 30-60 hours of playtime await you in this massive adventure, with 7 unique areas and many secrets to uncover. Rebuild settlements, establish trade routes and advance science by helping people. Each new advancement will be accompanied by the settlements changing visually, opening up new paths and opportunities!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game will have Native Linux support and the new demo does too. No release date set for the full game yet. Looks thoroughly to be worth a go though.</p>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast rated Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few hours before Dying Light: The Beast releases today, Valve put up a green tick for it to be Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible. There's no special notices about external gamepads or any online requirements, so hopefully that will make it easy to take it on the go and to dock to a TV too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9524350551758202649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's going to be a big release, with over a million pre-orders so this is exciting to see. However, performance is always a concern when it comes to bigger games like this. The Steam Deck Verified badge doesn't <em>always</em> mean the performance is actually where you would expect it to be, Valve are a bit inconsistent on the rating when it comes to overall performance. Mostly correct, but there's been a few definite odd cases that shouldn't be Verified.</p>
<p>The developers seem happy with it, since they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/787688820859471060" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the rating too. In their announcement Techland said: "Want to UNLEASH THE BEAST wherever, whenever? Well, you can because Dying Light: The Beast is Steam Deck Verified and fully optimized for smooth gameplay!".</p>
<p><em>I'm even more curious about it now.</em></p>
<p>Need a catch up? Techland released a new "The Story So Far" trailer you can view below:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>A top-down shooter where anything from cars, cameras, electronics and even enemy implants can be rewired into chaotic chains of destruction in DeadWire. Hack the planet? Hack the system? Cause some chaotic chains and it does look like things can get quite messy and fun.</p>
<p>Featuring more than thirty hand-crafted levels, and an additional score-chasing mode backed up with a slick synthwave soundtrack this is one for fans of Hotline Miami and other similar action games for sure.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>"One second players will be sprinting through a neon alley, the next, they’re rewiring a car, a CCTV camera, and unlucky guards into a chaotic chain-reaction." – said Arman, Solo Developer and Founder at Shotgun Anaconda. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.11 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters and players of the fheroes2 project, the open source reimplementation of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 for modern platforms!</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to present a new version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>1.1.11</strong></a> This release includes several major changes and many smaller but important updates.</p>
<p>First of all, map makers can now set any <strong>spells in Mage Guilds</strong> within Towns and Castles. This allows precise control of available spells and enables truly unique maps.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20861121981758197486gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20861121981758197486gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, map makers can ban specific spells in Mage Guilds so that they never appear, offering new ways of balancing the gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12078434231758197502gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12078434231758197502gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Secondly, map makers can select which monsters will appear in the <strong>Random Monster</strong> objects. Previously these objects generated completely random creatures, but now you can narrow down the selection - for example, to shooters only. This provides more control without reducing map replayability.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10879279871758197517gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10879279871758197517gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>During battles, the battle queue now highlights monsters with an <strong>outline</strong> when you hover the mouse over them, showing the order of their turns. It’s a small but helpful improvement when you're unsure of the turn order.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12633379191758197535gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12633379191758197535gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Among other UI changes, the team added <strong>icons</strong> for the Monster of the Week and Monster of the Month event dialogs, and the monster <strong>upgrade cost</strong> is now shown in the upgrade dialog.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10234898391758197558gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10234898391758197558gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21228635401758197559gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21228635401758197559gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In total, over 40 issues have been fixed since the last release.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this upgraded version of the engine, and we thank you for your continued support of the project!</p>
<p>Don't forget, that you also need to grab the data from <a href="https://gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">fheroes2</a> project on the GitHub page.</p>

      <title>Use rule-bending books to build a massive score in anagram roguelike Watchword - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build words letter by letter, while using magical books to bend the rules potentially in your favour in the anagram roguelike Watchword. <em>Seems like it's taking a little flair from Balatro with the style.</em></p>
<p>Not just a roguelike but it's also a bit of a deck-builder, with you building up your letters and special relics to help or hinder your run. Each run through it is unique too, with the developer saying it's "endlessly re-playable", and you can even find ways to make up words in it too. As a roguelike there's also an upgrades and unlocks system where you can buy new items in a shop.</p>
<p>It also has Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>. Check out the trailer:</p>
