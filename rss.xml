      <title>Vampire Survivors 1.0 coming soon along with a price increase</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a>, a simple game that exploded in popularity is set for the big 1.0 release soon and so the price will be rising next week. This game works great on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Currently only £2.09 / $2.99 / €2.39, it's an absolute steal for what it is. They haven't said how much it will increase to but they did say it will happen on September 21st so you should really just go and buy it now. Seriously, buy it. You will thank me later for all that free time you no longer have as the hours disappear.</p>
<p>They also released a small update to keep you going before the 1.0 that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1 new achievement: Reach Level 99 with Poe.</li>
<li>The last Arcana: XXI - Blood Astronomia.</li>
<li>1 new "weapon" : this is more like a minor gameplay feature.</li>
<li>1 new SECRET.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Update trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Castle Game Engine building up towards a huge new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/godot-engine-4-hits-beta-with-absolutely-loads-new/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> that's building towards a big new release. We also have the free and open source <a href="https://castle-engine.io/" target="_blank">Castle Game Engine</a> you might want to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>"A cross-platform (desktop, mobile, console) 3D and 2D game engine. Powerful visual editor. Support for glTF, X3D, Spine and more. Fast clean code using modern Pascal. Free and open-source." — official site.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact: not only is the game engine and exports supported natively on Linux, it's mostly developed on Linux too.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3483880041663345899gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3483880041663345899gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new coming to the 7.0 release which is now on it's second Alpha build includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated Sprite Sheet Editor.</li>
<li>New and improved Font handling.</li>
<li>New camera and navigation handling.</li>
<li>A new Fog system.</li>
<li>Debian Linux packaging and Free Desktop metadata support.</li>
<li>Delphi support.</li>
<li>glTF 2.0 full support and realistic rendering upgrades.</li>
<li>Android building upgrades.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch full support.</li>
<li>Lots of performance improvements like dynamic batching, built-in profilers and more.</li>
<li>New screen effects API</li>
<li>+ the list goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a look at almost everything planned for the 7.0 release, see <a href="https://castle-engine.io/new_features_in_castle_game_engine_7.0" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see more and more free and open source tools available and improving for game development. Even better when they work nicely cross-platform for both developing and testing games. CGE might not be the most well-known game engine, but it deserves a bit of a spotlight to show there's more than one way to build a game with FOSS.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets &#39;Local Wireless Multiplayer&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/ldn-is-here/" target="_blank">Local Wireless Multiplayer</a> is the latest huge feature to be added to the quite amazing Nintendo Switch emulator project yuzu.</p>
<p>For the official Switch hardware, this feature would allow two (or more) devices to connect up and play together. The way it works with yuzu is different to how it works on the Switch directly though, with it not being compatible with the Switch or other emulators. Sounds like a pretty extensive feature for yuzu too, with a whole virtual room system much like multiplayer lobbies you would find in various PC games. It also means you don't need a Nintendo account and it doesn't touch their servers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12112510461663344938gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12112510461663344938gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>With various public rooms available, and users who are fully Verified with yuzu directly will be able to host public rooms too. For people who don't want to do any verification, they will still be able to make rooms but they won't be listed publicly.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty great, giving you even more ways to play with others.</p>
<p>It's currently in their Early Access build until it's ready to be fully public.</p>

      <title>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw and some reflection on Steam Reviews</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw is a fantastic open-world space game but Rebel Galaxy Outlaw has a terrible Steam reviews score. Are Steam reviews making us miss out on good games?</p>
<p>Linux gamers on Steam have a particularly close relationship with the Steam community. Before the days of <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> it was Steam reviews and discussion pages where we would find out how well the game ran on Linux (excepting, of course, this publication). We also may be the most outspoken minority on Steam. Think of the obligatory "Will this come to linux?" Steam discussion post. We should be proud that our feedback can be<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/58-sales-and-over-38-of-bug-reports-from-linux-said-one-dev-but-its-been-helpful/" target="_blank"> especially helpful to developers</a>.</p>
<p>There are tireless Linux gamers dedicated to producing Steam reviews with Linux in mind (check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198184897393/recommended/" target="_blank">cbones</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Houtworm91/recommended/" target="_blank">Houtworm</a>, and the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux</a> Steam group). However, I have come to realize that my faith in Steam reviews may have come at a cost, and perhaps you will to. Think of a game that you love and believe most gamers should love, but which has an incomprehensibly poor rating on Steam. If you came up with one, we share something. If you can't think of one, sort your Steam library by Steam review and take a look near the bottom to see what you can find. This article is about Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, its 'Mixed' steam rating, and the system of Steam reviews upon which many of us rely.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997564941663272824gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997564941663272824gol1142.gif"/></a><br/>
<small>You can sort your Steam library by rating to find games you have played with poor ratings.</small></p>
<p>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw (RGO) is the sequel to the indie hit Rebel Galaxy and a spiritual successor to the Privateer franchise. It's an open world space game with light simulation elements and an old-school Western feel that plays great on my aging Geforce 1070 via Proton at 4K with maxed settings. There are <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/910830" target="_blank">some reports on ProtonDB</a> that you need to install mfc42 from <a href="https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks" target="_blank">Protontricks</a>, with GE-Proton7-30 I did not need to.</p>
<p>We play as Juno, a cynical spacer down on her luck, on a meandering adventure through Dodge Sector: a collection of stellar systems replete with various unsavoury characters, most of whom speak in a distinctly Deep South accent. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Firefly</a> is clearly a source of inspiration. You can fly trade routes, mine asteroids, take mercenary contracts, bounty hunt, smuggle contraband, and rob traders blind at gunpoint. The visual aesthetic is a delightful oversaturated kaleidoscope. It's well optimized and runs buttery smooth. The combat is smooth and satisfying. The writing and voice acting bounces between well-done and superb. It has a simulated economy with random events and fluctuating prices.  It has an embedded GIMP-like application for custom ship paintjobs. It has space station bars where you can play full-fledged minigames of dice-poker, 8-ball, slots, and Asteroids. You can flip twin birds to your enemies from inside your cockpit. It has the<a href="https://rebel-galaxy.com/the-music-of-rebel-galaxy-outlaw/" target="_blank"> best licensed soundtrack</a> of any game I have ever played, spread over seven different radio stations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wvYguV2baI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e0afe9157b5b4d647ec5fa292d4db2b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wvYguV2baI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><small> Content warning: Watch Juno rob innocent traders, destroy dastardly pirates, and sometimes both at once. Cringe as Juno fails at Asteroids on an arcade cabinet. One very mild story spoiler.</small></p>
<p>And yet despite all this, RGO has a resoundingly 'Mixed' rating from gamers on Steam. No review bombs, no political brigading, no glaring technical issues or mentions of Epic exclusivity, just gamers that don't recommend RGO to their peers. The complaints in negative reviews vary wildly; the game is too different from the original, the controls are poor, the game is repetitive, too difficult, or too simple. It's tough to pin down what gamers didn't like. The gaming press, on the other hand, liked RGO considerably more. On <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/8101/rebel-galaxy-outlaw" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, 84% of critics recommend the game, with an average score of 77%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4596940941663272824gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4596940941663272824gol1142.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There are plenty of criticisms in the Steam reviews that I agree with. The mouse and keyboard controls are not great (I play with a Steam Controller). There isn't the same amount of content as games like Elite; I'm 20 hour in to the game and I'm starting to upgrade to what I suspect is the highest equipment tier. The main story, while good, is spread a little thin. But given the positives, none of these complaints should be death-knells to a 30$ USD game that regularly goes on sale for 6$ USD. The mismatch between RGO's Steam rating and its positive qualities simply doesn't make sense. And what if RGO is not a one-off case, but one of countless games unjustly ignored because of poor Steam reviews?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19122069541663272823gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19122069541663272823gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
  Privateer fans will feel right at home in the cockpit view</p>
<p>The wisdom of crowds is the idea that the Law of Large Numbers from statistics can be applied to people's individual decisions. It roughly states that given a large number of independent assessments, the mean of those assessments will be correct. To the (albeit limited) extent that the quality of a game is objective, one is tempted to take Steam reviews very seriously indeed; after all, regular gamers are probably less likely than journalists to be influenced by each other (independence) and there are a lot of gamers writing steam reviews (large numbers).</p>
<p>For me, Steam reviews have been something close to gospel. An 'Overwhelmingly Positive' score is nearly an automatic wishlist. My brain translates a 'Mostly Positive' into 'Move Past', and a 'Mixed' into 'Melanoma'. There are benefits to this extreme faith in Steam reviews. If you play and browse through a lot of games it's difficult to investigate each game thoroughly, and a Steam review score offers a simple heuristic for whether to linger on a game's store page or move on. However, since discovering how fantastic RGO is, I'm haunted by the idea that I've been missing out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996878401663272826gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996878401663272826gol1142.png"/></a>A user-created paintjob for one of the ships in RGO, turning their cargo hauler into a mobile whiskey distillery for the premier in-game whiskey brand.</small></p>
<p>Steam reviews are also<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-developers-think-of-steam-reviews" target="_blank"> a mixed bag for developers</a>. For better or worse, Steam reviews make developers more responsive to the reviewer feedback. As the average gamer has more conservative taste than your average journalist, the Steam review system may makes developers more cautious when experimenting. The Steam review system likely favours lower-spec gamers and smaller gamer communities (like ours) compared with mainstream gaming journalism. A positive rating can be especially useful with smaller titles that don't have a lot of attention from gamer press or content creators. There are also unambiguous drawbacks to Steam reviews: buyers are more likely to complain than praise, trolling/brigading, out-of-date Early Access reviews, and the high playtime negative reviews (for bad reasons), to name a few.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2303836831663272826gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2303836831663272826gol1142.png"/></a><br/>
<small>  A couple of Elite: Dangerous reviews. One complains about the entirely optional multiplayer gamemode, the other is too busy playing Elite to elaborate.</small></p>
<p>Well, what's the solution? How do we as gamers balance the tempting simplicity of the Steam reviews system with its drawbacks, and the possibility of missing out on gems? Perhaps as you have guessed, there is no simple answer. All we can do is be aware of the limitations of the Steam review system and adjust our own mental processes accordingly. Personally, I will keep using Steam reviews as a useful tool in deciding how much time to spend looking into a game, but finding RGO has left me humbled. Now my brain reads 'Mixed' as 'Maybe another Rebel Galaxy Outlaw'. Which isn't all that bad; if the cost to finding another RGO is moving a little slower through my discovery queue, I think it's a fair trade.</p>
<p>Addendum: The only other game I own with a 'Mixed' rating that I loved is Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, but there I at least understand the Mixed rating: people wanted a horror game and got a walking simulator. I'm curious to hear what other people come up with.</p>

      <title>343 working on Halo: The Master Chief Collection anti-cheat for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems the hope for Easy Anti-Cheat being fully hooked up for Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton is not lost.</p>
<p>343 are actually working on it, but it seems like certain other games it has not been a simple case of just flicking a button and putting the files in the right places. On Reddit in reply to someone saying it's just ticking a box a 343 employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/xe2vd9/comment/ioj7b7r/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a bit more involved than that, but let me check with a few folks and try to get back to you with a status update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in a follow-up post they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's something more official from the developer on my team working on it.</p>
<p><em>We continue to work with Valve and EAC to enable EAC support on Steam Deck for Master Chief Collection. The addition of the easyanticheat_x64.so file is one of the prerequisites to getting this working, but there are ongoing compatibility issues that our three teams are collectively working to resolve.</em></p>
<p>I would love to provide more specifics, but the ongoing compatibility issues mean we only have a few pieces to the overall puzzle as everyone's working through their side.</p>
<p>Can confirm we ticked the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. While it doesn't work right now, they are actually working on it. Once I hear any more on it, I'll be sure to let you know. You can play single-player offline though in Halo MCC, although you probably <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-broke-on-linux-and-steam-deck-heres-a-quick-fix/" target="_blank">still need to do my fix</a>.</p>
<p>At least <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/proton-experimental-gets-halo-infinite-working-plus-airborne-kingdom/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite works</a> though right?</p>

      <title>Cities: Skylines - Plazas &amp; Promenades expansion is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making the best city-builder even better, the Cities: Skylines - Plazas &amp; Promenades expansion is out now.</p>
<p>Introducing special zoned pedestrian areas, allowing you to create walkable cities and car-free areas around their ideal metropolis. This expansion also brings specialized districts and city service buildings to Cities: Skylines, deepening the city simulator's management gameplay.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Streets: </strong>let your citizens walk freely on pedestrian-only streets! Place them in your city like any other road and create new green city centers free of most vehicles and pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Areas and New Policies: </strong>activate three area-specific policies for your city, including Slow Driving: all roads in the pedestrian area, except highways, get a speed limit of 20 km/hour. Sugar Ban: increases the average lifespan of citizens in the pedestrian area but decreases their happiness. Street Music: increases happiness and noise pollution in pedestrian commercial areas.</li>
<li><strong>District Specialization: </strong>we added 3 new district specializations: offices, high-density residential areas, and high-density commercial areas. Setting a specialization on a district affects all area squares in that district that will spawn buildings with a different visual appearance and a gameplay effect. Each specialization features 24 new modern wall-to-wall buildings!</li>
<li><strong>City Service Buildings: </strong>service buildings are important, but how about awesome-looking service buildings? Connect them to pedestrian areas by matching their visual style and provide services that contribute to good happiness values.</li>

      <title>Mesa gets a big CS:GO speedup, plus upcoming AMD RADV performance boost</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa, the open source driver set for Linux, has two rather interesting bits of work done recently that gamers might want to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Firstly, for those of you who are big fans of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18484" target="_blank">a patch</a> from developer Pierre-Eric Pelloux-Prayer was merged recently that was noted to reduce the startup time from "150s to 10s". CS:GO has historically taken forever to load up on Linux, although Valve did release a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/counter-strike-global-offensive-improves-startup-time-steam-deck-steam-input-improvement/" target="_blank">patch</a> recently that helped a little. So for AMD / Intel gamers on Linux, that should be a nice boost for the next Mesa release.</p>
<p>Unrelated but still interesting is that developer Mike Blumenkrantz has been back to <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/spaghetti-recipes/" target="_blank">blogging</a> about their work to improve various parts of Mesa. The result is <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18499" target="_blank">a patch</a> that's not yet merged, that brings with it a "40% improved indexed draw throughput" and "50% improved non-indexed draw throughput" (in short: better performance for the AMD Vulkan driver). No specific workload or games were mentioned to directly benefit but as with all improvements, every little helps.</p>
<p>Always nice to see performance improvements for Linux drivers.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The absolute classic that is Broken Sword 2 from Revolution Software just got a big surprise update, which should make it work a lot better in modern systems and the Steam Deck too! Originally released in 1997 and then Remastered in 2010 and now they're back to improve it yet again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17957438681663232795gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can see their full announcement on it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/33600/view/3283709169730015272" target="_blank">here</a> but here's some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved display resolution.</li>
<li>Better widescreen support.</li>
<li>Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Reduced file-size by about 40%.</li>
<li>Menu and UI refresh.</li>
<li>New high-resolution fonts.</li>
<li>Cloudsave support.</li>
<li>Steam Deck support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news is that they also confirmed work is ongoing for Broken Sword 1 to give it the same upgraded experience. We'll let you know when the update drops for that too!</p>

      <title>The Wandering Village is absolutely mesmerizing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village from Stray Fawn Studio, a game about building a village on the back of a massive moving creature has just entered Early Access with Native Linux support. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to hold back on you for this one and just jump straight to the point — this is without a doubt one of my <em>favourites</em> of this year. Something about it just feels slightly magical. City and village builders are a pretty crowded genre nowadays, with many different forms of it and yet Stray Fawn Studio have hit a home run here as far as I'm concerned. Admittedly though, the graphical style mixture took a brief bit of getting used to but after that it's smooth sailing. Or in this case, slowly walking along.</p>
<p>Inspired by Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, this is as unique as it gets.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Cgs-WWqadM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5f915e05e99d7e3cee7fed82e27713f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Cgs-WWqadM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The first time your great big creature friend Onbu gets up and starts moving, you never forget it. Honestly, that is already going high up in the list of things I won't ever forget. One of those great moments in gaming where you just sit back and go "wow!". It's really something. That's not the only thing I won't forget…there's me needing some stone, so I casually tell my people to go harvest what clearly looks like stone. After a while Onbu starts getting pretty grumpy and the game keeps telling me about their spikes being torn out and it took me far <em>too</em> long to realise I wasn't mining <em>normal</em> stone but Onbu's spikes. I felt quite bad after that. Please forgive me Onbu.</p>
<p>It reminds me of classic Settlers spiced with a little of RimWorld with an extra layer of survival. That is perhaps the best way I can think of to describe it right now. Not only are you building up your village and keeping your people fed, you've got this massive creature to worry about too. What path you should take next, will Onbu get sick, when will Onbu decide to have a nap and will it be a problematic area to sleep in? So much to think on.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build a unique village on the back of a giant creature known as Onbu.</li>
<li>Farm various crops to feed your villagers.</li>
<li>Send out foraging missions to gather rare resources.</li>
<li>Survive a variety of different biomes and events.</li>
<li>Build a relationship with a giant beast and influence its actions.</li>
<li>Research and construct a variety of different buildings.</li>
<li>Ecology/Biology inspired gameplay.</li>
<li>Unique art style with a blend of 3D and hand-drawn, hand-animated 2D graphics.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An easy recommendation to go and pick it up right now. The Linux version has been running great!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II &amp; III open source game engines get new releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of a double event. Not only has the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" target="_blank">fheroes2</a> seen a new release, but a surprise update of <a href="https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi" target="_blank">VCMI</a> for Heroes of Might and Magic III was also released.</p>
<p>For VCMI, it had been multiple <em>years</em> since the last release and they're calling this the big 1.0 meaning it should be fully playable. Both projects have an aim to keep the games going on modern platforms, along with a number of modern enhancement tweaks to get them working and feeling just a bit nicer.</p>
<p>The new VCMI 1.0 release adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spectator mode was implemented through command-line options.</li>
<li>Some main menu settings get saved after returning to main menu - last selected map, save etc.</li>
<li>Restart scenario button should work correctly now.</li>
<li>Skyship Grail works now immediately after capturing without battle.</li>
<li>Lodestar Grail implemented.</li>
<li>Fixed Gargoyles immunity.</li>
<li>Big multiplayer improvements including loading and saving, restarting and hotseat support.</li>
<li>Improved modding support.</li>
<li>Lots of AI improvements.</li>
<li>Improvements to the random map generator.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And there's loads more, it's a huge release!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/552317821663162802gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/552317821663162802gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On the other side is fheroes2 version 0.9.19 adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Polish rendering of objects on Adventure Map.</li>
<li>Introduce instant finishing of battles and enhanced army exchange mechanics.</li>
<li>Improve AI to avoid endlessly wandering on one place, correct start resources for them and artifact evaluation.</li>
<li>Add Campaign difficulty.</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>30</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.18 release.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For both games you need the original data files, which you can grab from GOG:</p>

      <title>Roadwarden, one of the best modern text-adventures around is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For anyone who considers themselves even a remote fan of text-adventures, you should definitely take a look at Roadwarden. Developed by Moral Anxiety Studio, a solo development operation from Poland, and published by Assemble Entertainment.</p>
<p>This is a fully illustrated text-based RPG where you explore a changing and often hostile realm. A beautiful modern take on a genre that not many developers dare to enter these days. It's entirely driven by various scenarios presented through the text, with you making decisions based on how you wish to play. Choices really do matter here and you get to choose to spec your character between a number of professions including warrior, mage, or scholar based on what abilities are upgraded and it will affect what you can do.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_yFp4opzdGA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e3f49b53ebbb30e698843c5d94fa6ea6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_yFp4opzdGA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore &amp; Change the World: </strong>Discover the secrets and face the challenges of a hostile fantasy world — inevitably unveiling its uniquely sinister history.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Grow With the Challenge: </strong></strong>Create your own background story, personal abilities, beliefs, and personality to shape your very own future as a Roadwarden.</li>
<li><strong>Classical RPG Attitude: </strong>Prepare yourself for an epic journey, either as a warrior, mage or scholar, and define your character‘s traits; like friendly, playful or intimidating, during interactions with various NPCs.</li>
<li><strong>Mysteries Unfold: </strong>Use your savvy and wiles when investigating and drawing your conclusions to understand the true nature of this world. Immerse yourself in detailed dialogues and sidequests with dozens of NPCs to gain their trust and support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly this is a beautiful gem of a game that deserves to be played.</p>
<p>Available to buy with Native Linux support from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/roadwarden" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roadwarden?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://moral-anxiety.itch.io/roadwarden" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1155970/Roadwarden/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Isonzo is a new WW1 FPS from the dev of Verdun out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Isonzo is the latest in the WW1 FPS series from the creator of Verdun and Tannenberg. It's out now and available with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The WW1 Game Series seeks to bring the Great War closer than ever before, and after prequels Verdun and Tannenberg, it is now Isonzo's turn to take the stage. Starting today, the Italian and Austro-Hungarian armies will clash in Isonzo river valleys and the Alps of the Southern Front. So far, it seems like a mostly quite improved version of the previous games in a new setting. The UI is also much cleaner than before.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LYmuhQmRb4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c14e7f7daa03abd9dbea9ca206e13b51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LYmuhQmRb4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game seems to perform well in my testing, there do seem to be some issues. For example, it launched with scopes completely broken on Windows (which I believe they've now fixed) and for the Linux version, it looks like shadows aren't working properly so everything is a bit too bright. Initially I thought that was NVIDIA-specific, but some have seen it on AMD too. Checking it with Proton, it seems to work properly there, so it's an issue in the Native port.</p>
<p>I'll be checking back on it again sometime soon to video it and give more thorough thoughts, as my key only came in on release day.</p>
<p>From the press email: “We’ve worked on Isonzo for over three years now with a passionate development team and several historians. We’re all very excited to finally put this title out there for all to experience! But our Italian adventure doesn’t end here - as with our earlier games we have great plans for new content beyond launch. First up on the roadmap: German troops!” says Jos Hoebe, Creative Director and co-founder of the WW1 Game Series.</p>

      <title>Valheim is getting crossplay with an update now in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3398551594417384215" target="_blank">announced</a> that Valheim is set for crossplay, with an update now available in testing to ensure you can play with friends anywhere. This is great, as Valheim is coming to consoles next year.</p>
<p>They've been working with a team from Piktiv, to "make sure the game looks and feels the same regardless of what platform you’re using". For Steam players, nothing much changes but it does mean you will be able to play with others elsewhere when the time comes. For dedicated servers, the big change is that it will have an option to support crossplay but it remains optional and you will be able to use either an IP address or a special server-specific code.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6633860821663153676gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Crossplay support added.</li>
<li>‘Manage saves’ GUI added so that it’s easier for players to restore/remove saves &amp; backups.</li>
<li>Minor network optimization for in-game hosting (Less demanding for the host when other players are in the game at the same time).</li>
<li>‘Join Game’ tab has been updated. Players can now add favourite servers, and see if a server is running, and if they support crossplay or not.</li>
<li>Players can now use the parameter ‘-crossplay’ while running Dedicated servers to support crossplay. When using this parameter, the backend will be running Playfab instead of Steamworks. (A ‘Join code’ will appear when you join a Dedicated server supporting crossplay. Players can use this code to join the server).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update is in the Public Test branch of Valheim, and may therefore be unstable. To access it you need a password which is in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3398551594417384215" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>EA AntiCheat could spell trouble for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA has just recently given out more information on their upcoming EA AntiCheat (EAAC), not to be confused with Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), because EA are apparently terribly at naming.</p>
<p>In their new <a href="https://www.ea.com/security/news/eaac-deep-dive" target="_blank">Deep Dive</a>, they went over various details about their new EAAC and how it will affect their games. The first big note is that it will be kernel-mode, which is usually something that doesn't play nicely (or at all) with Linux and so this could be some bad news for the Steam Deck too. Not only that, it's an anti-tamper tech too.</p>
<p>Take FIFA 22 for example, it's playable on Linux and has a "Playable" Steam Deck rating. However, FIFA 23 will be launching in October and guess what? It will have EA's new AntiCheat. So, this might mean it won't work at all.</p>
<p>It won't end up in every game from EA though, as they said in the post they will work with each studio to determine their needs. It also mentions for some titles they may only use "user-mode protections" (no kernel-level stuff) or just not have any at all.</p>
<p>A worrying trend though, with more and more anti-cheat going kernel-side which is almost always developed just for Windows. It's problematic for another reason though, like the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/h/ransomware-actor-abuses-genshin-impact-anti-cheat-driver-to-kill-antivirus.html" target="_blank">recent issue</a> with Genshin Impact where the anti-cheat driver was abused to disable anti-virus.</p>
<p>What do you think to this news?</p>

      <title>Your Steam Deck deserves a DeckMate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creator of the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">DeckMate</a> system sent over a bundle of their accessories for me to try and I was instantly sold on the whole thing.</p>
<p>It's not one thing but rather a <em>collection</em> of accessories, that all hook into a bracket that you attach directly to the back of the Steam Deck. You can get a Wall Mount, a Stand, a VESA Mount, Universal Adapters that you can stick to anything and more. A system I had only heard of recently and when the creator got in touch, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to give it a go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10197145431663075194gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10197145431663075194gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I've seen a number of comments across the web mentioning how it would have been better if the Steam Deck had a built-in kickstand. While perhaps true in some ways, one you add-on after has a lot of benefits. You can remove it and replace it easily and the stand that you can get for the DeckMate is frankly brilliant. Sturdy, easy to clip on and easy to remove to put it away. The other accessories you can get are equally as good.</p>
<p>I'm a serious fan. The new home for one of my Steam Decks is now sat attached to my wall ready to clip it off whenever I need it — no longer will i worry about dropping a drink on it.</p>
<p>Check out my video demo of a few bits of the DeckMate system:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nl2o0mFkLzA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4addbdfd5d591374080bb47cc64e8957.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nl2o0mFkLzA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Ridiculously easy to use, good construction and an easy recommendation to go and pick up.</p>
<p>At some point I'm hoping to have a chat with the creator, as some form of interview so keep an eye out for that but I wanted to get this out first because it's just that good and fully deserves some more attention on it.</p>

      <title>W4 Games raised $8.5 million USD to support Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://w4games.com" target="_blank">W4 Games</a> is a new company from the creator of <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> along with long-time contributors, and now they've managed to gain plenty of funding.</p>
<p>As a brief reminder, the idea of the new company was to provide commercial products and services like support plans and access to more restricted markets (like consoles) and generally support Godot Engine development. So all improvements made as part of W4 Games will go into Godot directly whenever possible.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://w4games.com/2022/09/13/w4-games-raises-8-5-million-to-support-godot-engine-growth/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they've announced $8.5 million dollars from a "seed funding investment round" (a first ever round of funding for a company) led by OSS Capita, which is so far the world's only investor platform targeting commercial open source and LUX Capital who specialize in funding science and technology ventures. They also had help from the founder of Red Hat and Sisu Game Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund focused on games.</p>
<p>They said that the funds will "be used to expand W4 Games’ core team and accelerate the development of a suite of products and services for the Godot ecosystem, enabling all developers to create and publish games and applications on all major platforms" with a roadmap planned to be shown at GDC 2023.</p>
<p>For a free and open source game engine, this is hopefully very welcome news to help put it along side the much bigger teams from Unity, Unreal and others.</p>

      <title>Valheim gets more teasers of The Mistlands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate assure us it's coming but they're not quite ready to set a date for The Mistlands update to Valheim. So we don't have a date but we do have some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4649425839615258188" target="_blank">more info</a>, plus some extra screenshots.</p>
<p>They mentioned how they're tweaking progression for Mistlands, to ensure it feels rewarding. They've put plenty of work into making some creepy cave dungeons but they needed a real purpose. So now they've added a "special extractor item" that you will use to process a new Black Core but they won't say what it's for yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7975137431663072380gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7975137431663072380gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you make a new character, there's also going to be some new hairstyle options too:</p>

<p>And of course there's going to be some fancy new outfits to go along with it all too:</p>

      <title>This Vampire Survivors styled game has you defend against pigeons pooping on your house</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pigeons, they can be a menace flying around pooping everywhere and this developer decided to make a game styled like Vampire Survivors about it. It's called "Don't Shit On My #!$@&amp; Roof" and I don't think it needs much in the way of an explanation does it? Your clearly angry about the Pigeons and so you're taking matters into your own hands.</p>
<p>The gameplay is very much Vampire Survivors, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">a horde shooter</a> where you don't directly control the weapons. Here you do actually aim some of them though, so it's a little more like a twin-stick shooter but with automatic weapon firing. When you level up you get to pick new abilities, and continue surviving against the flock of Pigeons for as long as you can.</p>
<p>As low-budget as it looks, just like all the others, it still has that comedy element here that might set it apart. I'll be giving it a go I think.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qgJf6eJWg9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0ffc549008acda279d9862d3f0f1a453.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qgJf6eJWg9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2143950/Dont_Shit_On_My__Roof/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will release into Early Access with Native Linux support on September 27th.</p>

      <title>Valve dev shows more Steam Deck prototypes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to see what could have been? Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais has revealed some working prototype units and they look pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1569404939864264704" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Griffais mentioned "As part of the Asia launch press event, we made the design lab into a showroom of development history. My favorite are the playable prototypes: bootable Deck family tree from mid-2019 to now, from a couple of hand-built units onto gradual mass production."</p>
<p>Here's the pictures:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14121455861663055004gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14121455861663055004gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/632151151663055009gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/632151151663055009gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Must admit, the one with white corners does look pretty sweet. Fun to see the iteration they did on the design here but I think overall we got the best of it in the released model.</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1569445637799956480" target="_blank">post</a>, Griffais mentioned "The best part is that they (mostly) all still boot, serving as an exciting reminder of how far things have come since.</p>
<p>This one has a Picasso APU, at about half of the GPU power of the final Deck. The flatter ergo was an interesting experiment and taught us a ton about comfort."</p>
<p>That post also came with a short video to show one of the older devices working:</p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>On top of that, the official OnDeck Twitter account has also been <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeckJP/status/1569506147635060737" target="_blank">showing off</a> a massive Steam Deck for the Tokyo Games Show and it looks pretty fun.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 18: Run Away and Join the Circus</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-17-the-llama-master/" target="_blank">Part 17: The Llama Master</a></strong></p>
<p>In writing this series I have spent a great deal of time searching eBay for older Linux games to cover, and one night I came across a curious sight. Although being sold for Windows, I found a listing for a physical copy of the free game <em>Circus Linux!</em> as published by Alten8. At first I figured it would just be another keep case in my collection with "Linux" on the cover, but upon inspecting the contents of the disc, it soon became apparent just how cheap this retail release was.</p>
<p>All that Alten8 seems to have done was package the source directory with a Windows binary already built, with the install instructions urging you to "copy and paste the folder CIRCUS from the CD" and then click on the circuslinux.exe file. With the source code included I decided it would be trivial to also build the game for Linux, and in fact the included INSTALL.txt file even tells you how to compile and install the game on Linux with GNU Automake.</p>
<p>You do need the relevant SDL development libraries as packaged by your distribution, and unfortunately Alten8 did seem to strip away some of the game's documentation files, meaning that the build will fail at first. To get around this I just used the "touch AUTHORS.txt COPYING.txt CHANGES.txt README-SDL.txt" command to create blank placeholders, but you really are just better off grabbing the source code yourself online apart from the novelty.</p>
<p><em>Circus Linux!</em> itself is a remake of the older <em>Circus Atari</em>, which was itself a home console version of the even older <em>Circus</em> arcade cabinet by Taito. <em>Circus </em>was a block breaker game inspired by <em>Breakout</em>, with the main change being that the game is now simulating a teeterboard act, with the blocks becoming balloons and your paddle a seesaw. This does have a marked difference on the gameplay, as you need to ensure your clown lands on the correct end of the teeterboard.</p>
<p><em>Circus Linux!</em> goes all in on the theme in a way that the original Atari version never could, sporting bright colourful animated graphics and fun upbeat music and sound effects, showing off the power of the then still fresh Simple DirectMedia Layer. One aggravation is that the mouse can leave the window when not playing full screen, but the game does at least support a number of screen modes, including a lower graphics setting for less powerful computers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6219288891662950103gol6.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6219288891662950103gol6.jpeg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13407756201662955891gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13407756201662955891gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Needless to say even on full the game did not cause my Pentium III 500 Mhz to break a sweat, but I appreciate the option. Beyond this the game features a number of gameplay modifiers: "Barriers" which can block your shots, "Bouncy Balloons" that can cause the clown to careen back down on contact, and "Clear All" that demands every balloon be popped on a stage before proceeding to the next screen.</p>
<p>Like most arcade games <em>Circus Linux!</em> is a test of both your dexterity and endurance, challenging you to hold on to your lives for as long as possible while racking up the highest possible score. The game also has support for local hot seat multiplayer, either in a cooperative mode where you both get the chance to help one another pop balloons, or an adversarial mode where you compete to earn the highest possible score. </p>
<p>Perhaps more compelling than <em>Circus Linux!</em> on its own is the legacy of its creator Bill Kendrick and his development house New Breed Software, a prolific figure in the free and open source gaming scene. He is most famous for starting work on the platformer S<em>uperTux</em> and crafting the drawing program<em> Tux Paint</em>, helping to popularize Tux as a gaming icon with others in the Tux4Kids initiative, all alongside the work of people like Steve Baker and Ingo Ruhnke.</p>
<p>Bill Kendrick has also created a number of other arcade conversions, edutainment, and experimental software toys which he ports to the widest possible range of platforms, all of which can still be found on the New Breed Software website. Five of them, <em>X-Bomber,</em> <em>Mad Bomber</em>,<em> 3D Pong</em>, <em>ICBM3D</em>, and <em>Gem Drop X,</em> were included on <em>100 Great Linux Games. </em>He even made a chat bot called <em>Virtual Kendrick</em>, inspired by a comment that he should port himself to the Zaurus handheld.</p>
<p>I have avoided it long enough, but I am feeling the itch to play a first person shooter again. As has already been made clear Linux has never had a shortage of them, but some are a lot harder to find today than others. The next game I am to cover is one of the rarest of them all, due to its limited physical distribution, and an attachment to a Belgian company now more known for maintaining an operating system than porting games.</p>

      <title>I hate to admit it but I like Disney Dreamlight Valley — works well on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well here's a game I didn't expect to like or actually be any good. It's Disney Dreamlight Valley from Gameloft, a game that's a mixture of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley but for Disney fans.</p>
<p>Gameloft aren’t a particularly well-liked developer, especially on Steam where their previous releases were free to play with lots of micro-transactions. At least in this case though, they seem to be doing <em>much</em> better than usual. It's also currently a paid game but once it leaves Early Access it will be <em>free</em> to play.</p>
<p>So far it runs well on Steam Deck and Linux with Proton Experimental, although I found that the default Proton 7 now and then decided to crash, like during / after cut-scenes which has been smooth sailing with Experimental. I've been playing it with the screen locked to 45Hz from the performance menu with Graphics set to Medium, Shadows on Low and Distance Quality on Low which has given a mostly smooth experience. With that, you get between 2-3 hours, and when performance does dip down because we’re locking the screen to 45 you won’t feel it so much or even notice many of the smaller dips like you would if you were sat on 60Hz.</p>
<p>Here's some gameplay on Steam Deck and me talking about it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wuGoNdyzBRk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e58e1d16a15c243e88a61edb7600f0f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wuGoNdyzBRk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On my Fedora Linux desktop, it has also been running very nicely on Ultra details which is not unexpected considering I'm running an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and an AMD Ryzen 5800x. Nice to see it running well across the board though!</p>
<p>A game I didn't expect to like but I definitely do. Originally a game I planned to have with music in the background, or some YouTube videos playing but honestly, it's started sucking away my actual proper attention because I want to keep going in and doing more quests. The game quite nicely mixes together a little adventuring, questing, exploration and tending to your little garden.</p>
<p>Gameloft mentioned that the full version will have a completed main storyline but they're not announcing a whole lot about it yet other than it having "memorable characters from Mickey &amp; Friends, Disney’s The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, and Moana, Disney and Pixar’s Toy Story, WALL•E, and more". There's already plenty of Disney characters to meet too so Disney fans can have plenty of fun and you can even take a snap of your character with them and share it across social networks.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401590/Disney_Dreamlight_Valley/" target="_blank">game on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve are still fixing up Left 4 Dead 2, over 10 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve seem to be continuing to give some love to their older titles, with Left 4 Dead 2 recently getting a nice bug-fix release. This is one of their older Native Linux ports, that came to Linux officially back in 2013 and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/left-4-dead-2-updated-with-vulkan-support-thanks-to-dxvk/" target="_blank">back in 2021</a> they updated it with Vulkan support powered by DXVK.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10312908351663001977gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/550/view/3276953770279922618" target="_blank">latest update</a> went out Friday, September 9th that contained this improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a shader crash with Vulkan on Intel.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux at the main menu.</li>
<li>Fixed text corruption in the Mutations menu on Linux.</li>
<li>Return the model index from script precache calls.</li>
<li>Added script function "GetModelIndex"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see Linux in particular see improvements, although not surprising since they of course want to see it continue to run nicely on the Steam Deck since that runs SteamOS Linux.</p>
<p>In other news, Left 4 Dead 2 Mobile recently appeared but it turned out to be something of a scam and it honestly <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1566775780738211843" target="_blank">looked pretty hilarious</a> because it was so bad.</p>

      <title>Distrobox can open up the Steam Deck to a whole new world</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://distrobox.privatedns.org/" target="_blank">Distrobox</a> is a way to use pretty much any other Linux distribution in your terminal, along with full GUI apps and now it supports the Steam Deck with SteamOS too.</p>
<p>The update released a few days ago had some issues (<a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/401" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/409" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/403" target="_blank">#3</a>), which I reported to the developer and they've since fixed up the installers and the documentation for Steam Deck. So with that in mind, I took it for a spin to see how it works and I've been thoroughly impressed with how easy it is.</p>
<p>It gives you a container system to install other distributions. So for the likes of SteamOS on the Steam Deck, without messing with the root filesystem, you can install something like Ubuntu and access everything it has available. Useful for software not available via Flathub (Discover) or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here's a short video overview of the basic setup and running some apps from Ubuntu on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kkkyNA31KOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9fec03545acd687a8ff4e8c8a459b8f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kkkyNA31KOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Guide</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/posts/install_rootless.md" target="_blank">official link</a>):</p>
<p>First up, run these install scripts one after the other in a terminal app (like <em>Konsole</em> on Steam Deck):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local</code></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/extras/install-podman | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local</code></p>
<p>Next up, we need to add the directories it uses into our .bashrc file, so we can run commands as normal in terminal. In your .bashrc file (found in your Home folder), open it in a text editor and add these to the bottom:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH</code></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">export PATH=$HOME/.local/podman/bin:$PATH</code></p>
<p>Now you can install a Linux distribution with Distrobox, with Ubuntu as the example (in terminal again):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">distrobox create -i ubuntu:20.04</code></p>
<p>Then once done, you can enter it:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">distrobox enter ubuntu-20-04</code></p>
<p>This is where the fun begins. Now you can install or do whatever you like, inside Ubuntu. However, you also need to add this to your .bashrc file to run graphical applications / games on Steam Deck:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">xhost +si:localuser:$USER</code></p>

      <title>Defend humanity from an alien organism in puzzle game Xenospore</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mixture of strategy and puzzling elements together, Xenospore is a currently free game about defending humanity by prevent a strange alien organism from spreading too far.</p>
<p>It's a tile-based game where you watch how the organism spreads, and try to prevent it. Each turn the alien spreads, and each turn you get to pick a tile to destroy or perhaps cleans as you desperately try to protect the housing. It has a wonderful dark atmosphere to it and the gameplay really does suck you right in.</p>
<p>Simple idea but styled wonderfully and the levels do make you think.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9163329811662980204gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9163329811662980204gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Quite a surprise to come across it on Twitter recently, as a game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> that I hadn't heard of before.</p>
<p>The developer is currently working on a big new update for it too including explosive chain-reaction tiles, a stronger type of Xenospore and various other gameplay enhancements to give you more to do. The update will also have some quality of life improvements too like a fast turn option.</p>
<p>You can grab it <a href="https://avivlevy.itch.io/xenospore" target="_blank">free from itch.io</a>. Play via the browser or scroll down the page for a download.</p>

      <title>The Minecraft Live event returns October 15 with a fresh mob vote</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you still love Minecraft and want to find out all that's coming, mark the calendars for October 15 as <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/live" target="_blank">Minecraft Live</a> is set to return.</p>
<p>This year it comes back with a fresh mob vote too. This is where the community gets to vote on what mob will be added next. Last year, it was the allay that got voted in.

      <title>GE-Proton 7-33 and Wine-GE-Proton 7-28 are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two very popular open source compatibility layer projects from developer 'GloriousEggroll' are out now, with updates to both GE-Proton and Wine-GE-Proton too.</p>
<p>GE-Proton is the popular community version of Valve's Proton translation layer, that includes extra fixes often before Valve have chance to test them fully and other fixes they can't perhaps legally do. Wine-GE on the other hand is for use outside of Steam, for projects like Lutris and Heroic.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-33" target="_blank">GE-Proton 7-33</a> brings these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge, pulls in more fixes for gta v, rdr2, verified bioshock remastered 1/2 + infinite work with 2k launcher</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d updated to latest git</li>
<li>pulled in latest proton script changes from upstream</li>
<li>fixed issue with fall guys protonfix trying to replace incorrect command name (Thanks Corben78)</li>
<li>removed Divinity Original Sin 2 launcher protonfix as it's no longer needed<br/>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: for Divinity Original Sin 2 you will need to do the following to return the game files back to normal:
	<blockquote>
<p>Open the game folder<br/>
	delete the 'bin' symlink<br/>
	rename 'bin-bak' as 'bin'<br/>
	delete the 'Data' symlink<br/>
	rename 'Data-bak' as 'Data'<br/>
	Then in steam verify the integrity of the game files.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-28" target="_blank">Wine-GE-Proton 7-28</a> here's what's new there:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge, pulls in more fixes for gta v, rdr2, verified bioshock remastered 1/2 + infinite work with 2k launcher</li>
<li>validated standalone RDR2 works -- lutris installers will be updated to use this version</li>
<li>validated GTA V was at least able to go online and in single player without any noticeable issues. Proton's patches are still in testing so the results may not be the same for everyone: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/37#issuecomment-1242570089" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/37#issuecomment-1242570089</a> -- lutris installers will be updated to use this version</li>
<li>validated BioShock 1/2 remastered + infinite work with 2k launcher</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How to install them?</p>
<p>For Wine-GE and the Heroic Games Launcher, it comes with a built in Wine Manager where you can download them and then you can adjust each game individually in their main settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3341212781662972384gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3341212781662972384gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19723196231662972383gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19723196231662972383gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For GE-Proton, you can simply use the ProtonUp-Qt tool that we've covered here numerous times now. See the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GOL Guide on GE-Proton with ProtonUp</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher version 2.4.3 is another critical bug-fix release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for running Epic Games and GOG has another important bug-fix release now available.</p>
<p>Version 2.4.3 continues the fixing from the last version, to deal with Epic Games changing things behind the scenes so this should get everything working again for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games from Epic games not downloading due to HTTP Error. It seems Epic broke something on their side again.</li>
<li>Fixed long issue with GOG games getting progress stuck while the game was being downloaded.</li>
<li>Fix some errors on Windows that was making Heroic to break on start on some machines.</li>
<li>Adds 7 new languages: Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarussian, Bosnian, Romanian, Norwergian Bokmål and Slovak.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2604674051662971576gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2604674051662971576gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully Epic won't continually change their API, as it will become quite a nuisance for both users and the Heroic developers to keep fixing it up. As mentioned previously though, it's a reminder that sticking to Steam (and legit Steam Key stores) is likely your best bet for Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Voxel Doom brings voxel goodness to the original DOOM</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am ashamed to admit that I never played much of the original DOOM when it came out or in the decades since. When I saw the Voxel Doom project I downloaded it and decided to finally give the old classic an honest try.</p>
<p>Voxel Doom is a mod for GZDoom, the open source implementation of the DOOM engine, which runs natively on Linux. The mod replaces 2D characters and props from Doom with fully 3D voxel-based models, made possible by what I can only assume is witchcraft on the part of the mod developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielWienerson" target="_blank">@cheelo</a>. Here's a quick video of me doing the famous first mission. If you want to backseat and tell me where the shotgun is I will appreciate it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5UcCGKkGP_I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea522412f43a8ca42734968e4335ce14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5UcCGKkGP_I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The effect is actually quite subtle and does an amazing job at preserving the original feel of DOOM (as far as I can tell). So far my favourite enemies are the Pinkies. I love their vacant faces, snorting noises, and how they waddle towards you with the sincere intent to do violence. I won't show the dead Pinkie model but it's truly something to behold.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2312412751662752780gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2312412751662752780gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p><br/>
To play Voxel Doom you will need the original DOOM WAD file, which you can get from purchasing the game on your platform of choice. A quick note for those without drag-and-drop file managers: you can launch the mod with the command <code class="inline-code">gzdoom -file /path/to/cheello_voxels.zip</code></p>
<p>You can download GZDoom <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads" target="_blank">from their website</a> and the Voxel Doom project from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-voxel-project" target="_blank">moddb</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve opens official Steam Deck repair centers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need to get your Steam Deck fixed up? Well, you no longer have to do it yourself as Valve have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3398545888823804940" target="_blank">officially opened</a> up some repair centers. If you need to send off your Steam Deck for any reason, it will now go to one of their specialized repair shops.</p>
<p>If your issue is under warranty, Valve will continue fixing free of charge. However, you now have the option of getting out of warranty repairs done professionally with a charge depending on what the problem is, instead of having to wait for iFixit to have parts and doing it yourself.</p>
<p>As they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If your unit begins to develop an intermittent button input issue (rare, but it sometimes happens), contact <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck" target="_blank">support</a>, who will help get your Steam Deck shipped to one of our repair centers. Our team will diagnose it, replace the button, test and calibrate the unit, then send the fixed unit back to you, free of charge – as this is covered by warranty.</li>
<li>If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty. Previously your only option was DIY repair, but now you'll now be able to contact support, who will supply instructions to ship your Steam Deck to one of our repair centers. Our team will take a look and offer to replace and calibrate your thumbstick for a fee. This process will also be available once your warranty expires.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This just continues to show how all-in Valve are on the future of the Steam Deck, like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">recent confirmation</a> that there will be future Steam Decks (like a Steam Deck 2?).</p>

      <title>Prison Architect is getting a &#39;Free for life&#39; update (and yes it&#39;s free)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Double Eleven and Paradox Interactive just announced a new free update coming to Prison Architect named 'Free for life'. The update will release on September 12th. Sounds like it's going to be quite a useful update too, although it doesn't really contain anything huge it's still a few welcome additions for this 7 year old game (yes it's really that old).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3728311111662725695gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3728311111662725695gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what they've said will be in the new update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Prisoner Log and improved Scheduler</p>
<ul>
<li>Always be aware of what's happening in your prison with the new Prisoner Log. Check your inmates’ activities, uncover misconducts ahead of time and keep track of who gets released, reformed, or reoffended. We also improved the game’s Scheduler, adding new options and settings in the palm of your hand.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Save and Reuse</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you create a new prison, a new policy, or a quick build, you’ll be able to save them in your Preferences. Save time setting up your prison next time you wish to start afresh!</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Aging is caring</p>
<ul>
<li>Now inmates are divided into Young, Senior and Elderly. After spending an extended period of time in your prison, they will change both visually and functionally. They will also develop different needs compared to younger inmates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Guards ranks</p>
<ul>
<li>Hired guards will now arrive at your prison unranked and will need to work hard to get promoted to Officer and Specialist Officer. Their commitment will be paid off though, as each increase in rank will provide additional perks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Improved building and planning tools</p>
<ul>
<li>The planning menu is getting renewed with lots of new options for fences and walls. Moreover, when “drawing” your walls and using construction options, you’ll see a new cursor-based tooltip stating the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the room, along with the planned cost for the currently drawn selection.</li>

      <title>Fight against socks and sandals, grey suits and more in Fashion Police Squad</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do people have against socks and sandals exactly? Fashion Police Squad is a funny new first-person shooter from Mopeful Games and No More Robots and might be one of my favourite games this year. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p><em>Runs perfectly on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton 7 out of the box.</em></p>
<p>Some first-person shooters have you fight against demons, or just various types of people with guns. Fashion Police Squad is different. Instead, you're cleaning up the streets full of dull people in suits or people committing fashion crimes that just look <em>too</em> cool.</p>
<p>This is a comedy shooter that does not take itself - or anything - seriously. You can quite literally slap fashion sense into people with a glowing glove. It's absolutely hilarious and one of the few games to make me properly chuckle out loud to myself while playing it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lRN_tYlnGQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/168be1f3beaa8a0709a01b59c8790f23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lRN_tYlnGQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it is a shooter and you are firing weapons at people, it's also not violent because your guns don't exactly fire bullets. You're giving people what they need — a fancy new look, or sorting out whatever fashion crimes come your way. Different types of enemies require a different approach and it's just brilliant. Find someone in a suit that doesn't fit? Pull out a different gun to blast their clothes full of pins and needles and sort them out. You also get to whip things with a belt too and it's hilarious.</p>
<p>The weapons themselves don't have a lot of feedback like other shooters but that's not the point. Here the feedback is you solving the fashion crisis unfolding in front of you, and the hearing glorious silly voice lines and seeing the magical transformations after you fix people up.</p>
<p>This is a serious surprise hit, and now happily one of my favourite experiences of 2022. Don't miss out on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pit yourself against all kinds of Fashion Crimes, from saggy pants to neon brights.</li>
<li>Utilize a specialized weapons arsenal, including weaponized Sock Gnomes.</li>
<li>Jump, climb and swing your way around Trendopolis to uncover its secrets.</li>
<li>Fight against the biggest, baddest bosses in the fashion industry.</li>
<li>Solve the mystery of the resurgence of Fashion Crime and take out the villains at the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1319460/Fashion_Police_Squad/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel reveals Arc Graphics A-Series desktop GPU specifications</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Intel ready up their dedicated desktop graphics, they have released fresh details on the specifications so here's what's about to arrive. Released in a short Q&amp;A video, I'll spare you diving in with the details right here but the video is below if you wish to listen in.</p>
<p>Just like their CPUs they will be split across different tiers including Intel Arc 3, 5, and 7 graphics. With 7 beiong "High Performance Gaming", 5 being "Advanced Gaming" and 3 being "Enhanced Gaming". Here's the specs:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17700339751662721273gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17700339751662721273gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When it comes to the higher-end though, they're split between 8GB and 16GB. Intel said that partners will mostly ship with 8GB but their Limited Edition GPU doubles it to 16GB. That's about the only difference they've revealed in the line-up. They also said that each card is fully features with HDR, variable refresh XeSS, video encoding for AV1 and other popular codecs.</p>
<p>You can see their full video below:</p>

      <title>The new Library Mode in Wine manager Bottles looks awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an update I missed recently somehow. <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the application you can use for managing various Windows games and apps installed with Wine had a fresh update with a fancy new Library Mode. Where do these developers find the time to constantly improve Bottles? Amazing.</p>
<p>This new Library Mode was previously an experimental feature that's been promoted to stable for everyone. What is it? In short: it allows you to view <u>all</u> the games and apps installed across different Bottles (Bottles is the name of the app, and the name of the spaces you install things into).</p>
<p>Here's how it looks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206564991662713434gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206564991662713434gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So no more swapping between various Bottles to find where everything is, as it's all available in one fancy place. Nice.</p>
<p>The 2022.8.28 also solves numerous bugs, moves around some legacy options and upgrades a couple of the Wine versions used they call "Runners" like Soda, Caffe and Vaniglia with plenty of improvements based on newer versions of Vanilla Wine and Valve Proton.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes out with free update and Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III has a big free update out now, plus the Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes event pack is out now. You can also try the game free this weekend.</p>
<p>This event pack adds in over one hundred new events spread across the game, along with several new pieces added to the musical score. From what Paradox said about it: "Over one hundred new events and event chains which expand upon the relationships you have with your family, friends, rivals, best friends, and nemeses. Experience a much more varied pool of random events every year, as well as specific heart-wrenching (or heart-stabbing!) reactive content for when you, as an example, lie dying, or when someone close to you takes part in a foreign battle."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jOFJ4TfJ1tg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b257bfbd5713a7b1fd9398625495cb0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jOFJ4TfJ1tg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's quite a lot new free for everyone too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an additional set of 12 new Childhood Personality Events, this will make certain personality trait combinations much more likely to appear, and also makes certain combinations possible that previously weren’t. The trait combinations are balanced in such a way that the choice for you as a guardian should be more interesting:
	<ul>
<li>diligent, gregarious, temperate</li>
<li>zealous, ambitious, sadistic</li>
<li>shy, paranoid, craven</li>
<li>lazy, gluttonous, compassionate</li>
<li>lustful, chaste</li>
<li>just, greedy, callous</li>
<li>humble, cynical, content</li>
<li>vengeful, deceitful, calm</li>
<li>generous, fickle, arrogant</li>
<li>forgiving, trusting, patient</li>
<li>honest, arbitrary, impatient</li>
<li>brave, stubborn, wrathful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a Friend, Best Friend, Rival, Nemesis, Lover, or Soulmate relation is formed, a reason will now be stated. For example: “Kaiser Heinrich and King Philippe shared an excellent feast in Aachen” or “Basileus Andreas swore to avenge the death of Aristarchos, who was slain in battle by Ulf Munk”. These reasons can be viewed for any character in the Relationships tab in the Character Window, presuming the relation is public.</li>
<li>Added relationship icons on character portraits so you can see who is your friend/rival/lover at a glance, along with an informative tooltip</li>
<li>Characters now have Memories of things happening in their lives (children born, battles won, rivals killed, etc etc.). These memories are used in events and other content. For example, if you are murdered your assassin might cite a grievance that your killer had against you. These memories might fade with time, and are usually lost on death. For certain characters memories are preserved longer or even forever (such as rulers the player has controlled, and high tier rulers).</li>
<li>Memories can be viewed by opening the Memory Viewer from the character window, via a button in the same place as the Kill List, Inventory, and Lifestyle.
	<ul>
<li>Memories are listed chronologically alongside the date they were added (you can flip direction with a toggle).</li>
<li>Private memories will not be visible unless it’s your own character, or you are in Observer mode. (private memories such as gaining a lover or murdering someone).</li>
<li>You can view the public memories of any character in the world.</li>
<li>Memory lists can be copied to the clipboard via a button and shared outside the game.</li>
<li>For convenience you can pin the Memory Viewer to one character, or browse through different characters while keeping the Memory Viewer open.</li>
<li>Memories are collected up during game play time, but some characters may start with some already in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the Loyal/Disloyal Traits, which affect how likely a character is to join factions, cheat on their spouse, etc. These traits are integrated as Sins/Virtues, hooked into Cultural Traditions, and can be gained through new events.</li>
<li>Reworked Populist Factions in order to improve their functionality, especially in regards to how they interact with player vassals:
	<ul>
<li>Vassals directly affected by a Populist Revolt now get a letter from the revolt leader, asking the vassal how they will respond to their demand. The vassal may:
		<ul>
<li>Join the war and help their liege</li>
<li>Convert to the faction's culture and/or faith and join the war on the side of the rebels</li>
<li>Stay out of the war and do nothing (though still risk losing land if the liege loses the war)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI vassals are most likely to join the war on the side of their liege, but can in rare cases pick either of the other two options</li>
<li>Made it so that AI lieges will never accept the faction demand if a player vassal is targeted by the faction (this will finally allow player vassals to intervene and help protect their own realm)</li>
<li>Greatly increased the military strength of Populist Factions, to compensate for the fact that vassals can join the war:
		<ul>
<li>Populist armies now spawn a few basic Men-at-Arms in addition to levies</li>
<li>Populist armies spawn Siege Weapons depending on their culture's innovations, allowing them to better scale into the late game</li>
<li>Populist factions now generate a few commanders to lead their troops</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The populist leader will now get some extra gold upon victory, to ensure that they can afford creating titles and Men-at-Arms</li>
<li>Reduced the rate at which factions gain discontent for being over the military power threshold. In practice, this will give rulers a longer time to react before factions press their ultimatum (especially when the faction is only slightly stronger than their target)</li>
<li>A successful Populist Faction will no longer usurp or create an existing title if they don't control at least 50% of its De Jure (this is to prevent titles from being usurped too easily)</li>
<li>Increased the restrictions for a successful Populist Faction to create custom kingdoms and duchies. They will primarily attempt to create a title without a holder or usurp an existing title</li>
<li>Rulers participating in a Populist Faction will now become independent if they have too high a rank to be vassalized by the populist leader, instead of remaining a vassal to their old liege</li>
<li>The leader of a successful Populist Faction should no longer steal counties from rulers joining the revolt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 14 new event illustrations
	<ul>
<li>Food Cellar</li>
<li>Crossroads with Inn</li>
<li>Hills</li>
<li>Plains</li>
<li>Bonfire</li>
<li>Kitchen (Western)</li>
<li>Jungle</li>
<li>Desert/Drylands</li>
<li>Docks (Tribal)</li>
<li>Castle Corridor Day/Night (Indian)</li>
<li>Courtyard (Indian)</li>
<li>Courtyard (MENA)</li>
<li>Relaxing Room</li>
<li>Wetlands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 new character animations for events
	<ul>
<li>Assassination pose with raised knife</li>
<li>Eavesdropping</li>
<li>Eye Rolling</li>
<li>Laughing</li>
<li>Drinking from Goblet</li>
<li>Holding Lantern</li>
<li>Toast Using Tankard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Classic racer Re-Volt returned to Steam — here&#39;s how to work it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Re-Volt is a retro delight from the year 1999 that originally came to GOG in 2013. Sadly it was pulled from sale when it was found to contain code written by the community, that the release did not have permission to use. Now it's back and on Steam too.</p>
<p>Here's how you can get this game running very nicely on a Steam Deck or a Linux desktop, with a Native Linux game engine called <a href="https://rvgl.org/" target="_blank">RVGL</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m55toWU-_bM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3dd51e61152748875ba3882efd5dde0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m55toWU-_bM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> either as an AppImage or Flatpak.</li>
<li>Inside ProtonUp-Qt install Luxtorpeda.</li>
<li>Find Re-Volt in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go to Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box and select Luxtorpeda from the dropdown box.</li>
<li>Play it and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>A small process to get a classic to live again properly. You may need to tweak the deadzone a little, as with the Steam Deck specifically I found the default a bit too low to control the cars properly.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/287310/ReVolt/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/revolt" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD announces FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1 upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD continue pushing ahead with improvements to their upscaling tech FidelityFX Super Resolution with version 2.1 already available now.</p>
<p>This is no small update either, with it containing some pretty significant changes. Exciting, as FSR 2.0 made playing <a href="https://youtu.be/-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2 on Steam Deck</a> a very nice experience. Given how big the difference was there in visual quality while giving good performance, I'm very keen to see what happens with FSR 2.1 and future updates.</p>
<p>Some of the changes made include:</p>
<div class="scrolling-table">
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Change</strong></td>
<td><strong>Impact</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Motion vector divergence used to diminish locked pixels</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should alleviate ghosting issues on geometry with motion vectors not matching underlying pixel colors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Disocclusion logic is now able to detect disocclusions in areas with only small depth separation between objects.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should alleviate ghosting issues and improve upscaling quality on some disocclusion cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Improved upscaled output quality by turning some half-precision computations to full precision.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should improve overall color range and temporal stability of the upscaled image produced.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>Even with the changes, AMD claim upgrading for developers should be simple as the API has not changed.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/meet-fidelityfx-super-resolution-2-1/" target="_blank">announcement</a> AMD showed off an example game with it hooked up in Farming Simulator 22:</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Red Dead Redemption 2, gets more games working</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Red Dead Redemption 2 had a big <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/9295354296595/RDR2-Title-Update-1-31-Notes-PS4-Xbox-One-PC" target="_blank">update</a> which amongst other things, added in FidelityX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0. Sadly, it broke it on Linux and Steam Deck but Valve already have a fix out but you need to pick it manually for now.</p>
<p>Valve updated Proton Experimental with the fix needed to get it working again, showing how they're clearly paying attention to some of the bigger games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Additionally the September 7th update of Proton Experimental also got these games working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathsmiles II</li>
<li>Primal Carnage: Extinction</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: for Proton Experimental on Desktop Linux, you now need at least Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer. Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a quick run over the changes and a quick-look at Red Dead Redemption 2 running again on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive improves startup time, Steam Deck Steam Input improvement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out an update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> that not only makes it startup faster but improves Steam Input handling on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>While competitive CSGO is likely not something you want to do on the Steam Deck, it still runs reasonably well. Although, this update might change your mind about playing it on Deck as they've updated Steam Input to support using mouse and keyboard input on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>They also improved game startup I/O to reduce launch time, improved the user interface flow when cycling through weapon case items in Agent View, fixed an incorrect inventory limit warning shown to users with many items in Storage Units and fixed an exploit that would allow the player’s camera to become detached from their eye position.</p>
<p>On top of that there's quite a few map adjustments you can see below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="blog_shadow">
<p>Anubis<br/>
– Added a hip cover on the plateau near B main.<br/>
– Clipped the large stone cover on CT mid for smoother movement.<br/>
– Added a scaffolding on A catwalk to prevent the boost through the window to T stair at the canal. (Thanks poseidonskiy rofls).<br/>
– Allowed players to silently drop down from A long.<br/>
– Fixed stones colliding with the tarp on A catwalk.<br/>
– Removed stone at A sewer.<br/>
– Aligned floating pillar on A with the floor.<br/>
– Removed left-over clips on A main. (Thanks Hentie!).<br/>
– Removed clips on the stairs that bounce off grenades (Thanks Guidetti &amp; dr!zzle).<br/>
– Clipping improvements (Thanks dr!zzle!).<br/>
– Cleaned up clipping under the bridge (Thanks Fnugz for your sacrifice).</p>
<p>Blagai<br/>
– Fixed pixelwalk on window frame (thanks Kerr).<br/>
– Increased C4 explosion radius.<br/>
– Fixed various visual bugs.</p>
<p>Cascade<br/>
– Added back a few visual details; ToOpenGL fix shouldn’t be affected; FPS sacrifice is minimal.<br/>
– Angled ladder in lower main; gives cover to Ts and worsens it as a camping spot for CTs.<br/>
– Clipping fixes.<br/>
– Removed self-boost in upper main near the bridge.</p>
<p>Ember<br/>
– Renamed Crater to Water Tower.<br/>
– A new water tower has been erected at Water Tower.<br/>
– Changed doors used throughout the map.<br/>
– Added sounds when doors are opened and closed.<br/>
– Gave cannons a new particle effect when firing.<br/>
– Fixed situation where cannonball may not damage players.<br/>
– Actually fixed cannons icon this time.<br/>
– Fixed weapon crate ammo spawning in floor near Apartments.<br/>
– Fixed lots of minor bugs (thanks Joaokaka1998).</p>

      <title>Paper Animal RPG takes inspiration from Paper Mario and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paper Animal RPG is a rather cute looking upcoming game. Currently in development from Cuddling Raccoons Studio it's a mixture of exploration, dungeon crawling, combat and a little relaxation by the campfire too.</p>
<p>With inspiration taken from the likes of Paper Mario, Mario &amp; Luigi as well as the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series it sure does look rather lovely. Each game is randomly generated and that includes a different map, items, skills, events and NPCs so it will be fresh(ish) each time. Featuring a rather interesting battle system that blends together tile-combat with real-time mechanics so it definitely has my attention there.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s9Tr6YKyIkY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d895db7a5188169ba4dd4824160541bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s9Tr6YKyIkY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procedurally generated maps</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>6 adorable characters</strong>, specializing in power, utility and defense!</li>
<li>A bunch of <strong>consumable items</strong>. Once you stole a cookpot from an enemy camp you can <strong>combine them and experiment with the results</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Equip and upgrade skills</strong> suited to a character's role and customize your playstyle!</li>
<li><strong>Find stickers that grant passive abilities</strong> - if you get lucky you can even find more powerful, holographic ones!</li>
<li><strong>Defeat mean bosses</strong>, which have each an alterantive stronger version when you start a Rewind Run!</li>
<li>Classic Mode is too hard? Try <strong>Casual Mode</strong>, which features tweaked gameplay settings for an easier experience!</li>
<li>Compete against other players for a global online highscore who played with the same generation seed as you in <strong>Tournament Mode</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Numerous unlockable achievements</strong>, which guide you to explore all aspects of the game!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paperanimalrpg/paper-animal-rpg/description" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, with the developer telling me clearly Linux will be supported. They've also now updated the campaign to note this in the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does PC include Linux? What about Steam Deck?</p>
<p>Yes, and yes! Paper Animal RPG will be natively supported on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems the campaign has been popular, with the €40,000 goal nearly hit with 28 days still to go so it's a clear winner.</p>
<p>You can also follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1982120/Paper_Animal_RPG/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Excavation of Hob&#39;s Barrow releases September 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is an upcoming folk horror narrative-driven point and click adventure, with a really great mixture of animated pixel-art and Native Linux support. Coming from Cloak and Dagger Games and Wadjet Eye Games, nice to see more fully supported games like this.</p>
<p>"Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind. Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers."</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>dark</strong>, <strong>complex </strong>and <strong>evolving </strong>storyline featuring interwoven elements from real English folklore.</li>
<li>Traditional <strong>point and click</strong> adventure game <strong>puzzles </strong>and interactions, with an easy modern interface.</li>
<li>A cast of<strong> intriguing characters</strong>, from suspicious villagers to sickly vicars to lordly landowners, all with their own unique stories and motives.</li>
<li>A distinct<strong> folk horror</strong> tone and grounding.</li>
<li>Evocative<strong> pixel-art </strong>graphics, featuring cut-scenes and engaging animations.</li>
<li>A suitably <strong>atmospheric original soundtrack</strong> from The Machine. The Demon. - one half of the duo behind the award-winning "Football Game" soundtrack.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA are teasing something, likely their RTX 40 series GPU (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems we're due the next-gen lot of GPUs from NVIDIA soon, as they've begun their teaser campaign for something big.</p>
<p>Posted on Twitter from the official NVIDIA GeForce <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1567659030247575552" target="_blank">account</a> was a brief 9 second video, with a simple message of "#ProjectBeyond". It obviously doesn't take a computer scientist to work out what's coming but it's good to know if you're after a new NVIDIA GPU that you might want to now hold off to see what the specifications and pricing are on the imminent RTX 40 series.</p>
<p>When to expect it? Well, it won't be long at all.</p>
<p>The GTC conference takes place between September 19-22, 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang mentioned during their recent Q2 2023 earnings call "I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month" so it's not exactly hard to imagine the initial announcement happening at GTC — so mark those calendars.</p>
<p>It won't be a full launch event of course, we're likely to only get a small slice of info on the next generation.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: another <a href="https://twitter.com/nvidiageforce/status/1567875534339674113" target="_blank">teaser</a> went up that seems to indicate something happening on September 20th.</p>

      <title>Valve overhauls the Steam Store with new categories, hubs and filtering</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Previously available in Steam Labs, some of the biggest changes to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam Store</a> in years are now live for everyone.</p>
<p>This update to the Steam Store brings a new look for various tags, genres, categories and other themed pages across the whole thing. You would have seen them in action during the various sales but now they're everywhere. This is part of Valve's work to make finding games easier, given how Steam has grown to host a massive amount of games.</p>
<p>You can find all the categories at the top of the Steam Store:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12167684621662571717gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12167684621662571717gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new includes the hub pages for all categories, themes, genres, and tags with each of them being personalized for you if you're signed in:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_2ZqUv BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_1SWg2">
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16328454851662571419gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16328454851662571419gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377937451662571417gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17377937451662571417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You get the usual big banners of games trying to grab your attention, and then plenty of filtering and sorting options below and this is on every single type of tag on the store. It's actually quite an impressive advancement for the store and should make finding something to play easier since you can tweak what you find to your liking.</p>
<p>This is why Valve continue to get my money. Not just because of Linux support and the Steam Deck but they are clearly always trying to make even just the basic store experience better.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JbLhGiB6SJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3fbf505b5855d990db28fa99d3ef9887.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JbLhGiB6SJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Brought Up on Feline-y Charges:</strong> A charming comedy-noir storyline set in the unique and intriguing city of Meow Meow Furrington, inspired by every cat ever and with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>A Point-and-Lick Adventure: </strong>Discover a whole new dimension to everything in the game by using Cuddles’ tongue. Lick first, and ask questions later. Questions like "what did you expect that to taste like, Cuddles?"</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>S’more Cats Equals S’more Fun: </strong>Experience the city from two very different perspectives as you switch between Cuddles and his trusty assistant, Tabby Marshmallow.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Purrfect Voice Acting:</strong> Laugh and learn about the world of Furth with over a hundred thousand words of fully-voiced dialogue performed by an all-star cast including Lucas Gilbertson (<em>Megaman X</em>), Carol-Anne Day (<em>A Hat in Time</em>) and SungWon Cho (<em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> “Adventure games like Day of the Tentacle and Broken Sword left a huge impression on me, and I wanted to pay tribute to the genre with my own unique contribution,” said William Kruger, Founder of Silvernode Games. “Nine Noir Lives is a dream come true for me, and I can’t wait for people to experience it. I hope they grow to love Cuddles Nutterbutter and Tabby Marshmallow as much as we here at Silvernode do.”</p>

      <title>Narrative adventure &#39;I Was a Teenage Exocolonist&#39; out with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist seems like a hard game to pin to a genre. It's a blending of a narrative adventure with RPG elements, deck-building and much more. It sure does look pretty too, love the colour scheme they went for on this one.</p>

Why do you remember doing this before?"</p>

<p>Valve continues rolling out smaller updates to the Steam Deck Beta, with another update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3311856667374154871#" target="_blank">out now</a> fixing some crashing issues.

<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General:</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets a huge update, expansion teaser and fixes the Steam Deck preset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Edgerunners Update is out now for Cyberpunk 2077, along with the Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion getting a reveal and a 2023 release date. Some fixes included for Steam Deck finally too.</p>
<p>A big new feature is cross-progression between all platforms if you want it. So you can play it pretty much anywhere that has this update and sync it all up. In a world of the Steam Deck making PC gaming portable, this is a really nice feature that I hope more games add in. It would be ridiculous to list everything that's new but some of it includes: easy wardrobe changes, 3 new gigs, a bunch of new weapons, a new mini-game, lots of balancing, new poison perks, new secrets to discover and modding updates.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Deck, these specific fixes made it in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Steam Deck] Fixed an issue where the dedicated preset was applying Ultra settings instead of properly crafted graphics settings.</li>
<li>[Steam Deck] Fixed an issue where the game became unresponsive after trying to change Key Bindings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first one was a pretty big problem that I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/cyberpunk-2077-gets-an-official-steam-deck-setting-but-seems-broken/" target="_blank">personally highlighted back in March</a>, because it gave the impression that Cyberpunk 2077 ran way worse than it should on Steam Deck. It's surprising it took them multiple months to fix a simple settings issue but that's par for the course when it comes to Cyberpunk 2077 development isn't it?</p>
<p>Oh there's the new expansion too and you can see the teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PbVKBoDuhZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f521eccf2590f79cf60e0f2f1a0d1f3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PbVKBoDuhZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can buy it to play on Linux with Proton or Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Survival game Vintage Story adds 200+ new blocks, lightning, water physics update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's pretty staggering just how advanced Vintage Story is becoming as a survival game. It's still relatively unknown but in my eyes it already rivals many popular games and another huge upgrade is out now. Vintage Story is not available on Steam, which is probably one of the biggest reasons it's not so well known. The developer isn't ruling it out but they want to hang onto that 30% that Valve would take.</p>
<p>Version 1.17.0 is out now named the "Stable De-Jank and Game Juice Update" and it's honestly massive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18998033991662484754gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18998033991662484754gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6119340881662484751gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6119340881662484751gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click to enlarge the images.</em></p>
<p>Some of the big new features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lightning strikes and Desert storms.</li>
<li>200+ new blocks.</li>
<li>A huge water physics update.</li>
<li>300 types of shields.</li>
<li>More and prettier flora.</li>
<li>New and improved fauna.</li>
<li>Improved Creature AI.</li>
<li>Extensive updates to the visuals in many places.</li>
<li>Massive performance tuning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the list goes on for quite a while, the changelog like most updates for Vintage Story is <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/forums/topic/9392-stable-de-jank-and-game-juice-update-1170/" target="_blank">rather long</a>. Perhaps mostly importantly though, you can now pet the animals. Okay, it's not the most exciting feature around but it's rather sweet.</p>

      <title>Void Scrappers is my new favourite coffee-break game — try the free Prologue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Void Scrappers Prologue, the new free version of the bigger upcoming Void Scrappers is out now and I had a chance to try it before release and came away very impressed. This is easily going to be my new coffee-break game at my desk, and my next time-sink to stay up far too late with in bed with my Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is yet another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde game / Vampire Survivor-like</a> or whatever else you wish to call it. One day I will perhaps get sick of it but it's still not today. It's a bit more like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a> in the way that it's a space sci-fi game with you controlling a ship but you fly around the area instead of being given a small scrolling area you're confined to.</p>
<p>This one becomes completely ridiculous the further you go into it and I've been having so much fun with it. The builds you can make are pretty great too, even with the limited selection available in the Prologue it makes for an entertaining time. Here's some footage mixed between my Fedora Linux desktop and the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x_EDky2n8NA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ff79bca69ca2bdb00e2345780603398c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x_EDky2n8NA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's surprising is just how smooth it feels already. The Prologue is just a glorified demo of a game that's not properly out yet but it feels so good already that I think the developer is onto a winner here.</p>
<p>You can try the free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126420/Void_Scrappers_Prologue/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers Prologue on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Classic pixel-art RTS &#39;TFC: The Fertile Crescent&#39; gets an online co-op Horde Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a really criminally overlooked pixel-art RTS that just got a major upgrade for all players.</p>
<p>A first major update for the Early Access title brings with it some big new features like the online co-op Horde Mode. Previously only available in single-player, you can now build up and survive with a friend online. That I honestly can't wait to try!</p>
<p>They've also added in more options you can tweak for single-player skirmish battles, you can add AI players to online matches and there's various other gameplay improvements too. Online play also got the ability to password protect games, so no more random people jumping into your lobby if you don't want them. You can also now actually kick players from an online lobby too.</p>
<p>Some other gameplay features were also added in like map pinging to allies, sending resources to allies, several improvements to the AI and lots of bug fixes.</p>

<p>A really great game that all base-building RTS lovers need to try.</p>
<p>I like this one so much, I gave it a little video overview for you:</p>

      <title>Prodeus cancels the Native Linux version, focusing on Proton compatibility (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prodeus, the crowdfunded first-person shooter that blends together new and old design styles, will no longer be doing a Native Linux version and instead will ensure it works nicely with Proton.</p>
<p>The team at Bounding Box Software had been quiet for some time on their plans here, seemingly ignoring all questions about Linux for many months so it's good to finally get a proper answer. Still, for those of you still sticking to <em>only</em> Native Linux games, this probably stings a little.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/prodeus/prodeus/comments?comment=Q29tbWVudC0zNzU3MDYwNw%3D%3D" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="flex">
<div class="w100p">
<p>We are making sure the game runs on Proton and will be doing a pass at reaching full green status on the Steam Deck once the game is fully out. Unfortunately, we won't be able to make a Native Linux build, there were far too many issues and we couldn't get it to run properly. The Proton version of the game has a much smoother experience and the tests on Steam Deck showed great promise. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in their Discord, a developer added this clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A little clarification on the Linux News. Right now the Unity tool chain for making native Linux builds is still experimental. While they say you can do it, it does not work all that well and, as stated above, there are graphical errors and various other issues that make the game unplayable. A Linux build may still be a possibility in the future but at this time it is on hold until Unity's Linux tool chain is in a better state and we have the resources to dedicate to figuring it out properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does in fact already run extremely well with the Proton compatibility layer both on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, take a look at one of my earlier videos of it on Deck below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w9Y4j069UmM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/411fe8a47e1a222cfefa476e22d59d8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w9Y4j069UmM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Prodeus is set to be released at some point soon it seems, with a release date announcement due to be revealed at the upcoming Realms Deep 2022 that will take place from Friday - Sunday, September 16-18 2022.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prodeus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/964800/Prodeus/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Even MORE invites for Steam Deck purchases will start going out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've heard this before right? As of today, Valve will be sending out even more emails each time to invite people to purchase their reserved Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is sounding a bit like déjà vu isn't it? You're not dreaming though. They just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-reservations-continue-to-grow-now-at-its-highest-point/" target="_blank">updated shipping windows</a> and said reservations are higher than ever, before that back in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/even-more-steam-deck-purchase-invites-are-going-out-from-now/" target="_blank">middle of August</a> Valve announced that more invites were going out, following a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">production ramp-up</a> announcement at the end of July. Here we are again and Valve developer Lawrence Yang just said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1566824774885842944" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those curious - yes, Steam Deck order emails are going out on Labor Day (they just went out). We also bumped up the number of order emails per batch with today's release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you're expecting an order email to come through, which as a reminder is every Monday and Thursday, keep your eyes firmly peeled on that inbox. You'll also get a notification inside Steam too.</p>

      <title>SiNKR 3 is a wonderful end to a clever wordless puzzle game series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love puzzle games? Check out the new Native Linux release of SiNKR 3. It's a wordless puzzle game that needs you to hook and pull various objects and it's quite a gem. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>While the idea may seem simple enough having you click the end of a hook to have it pull towards the end and capture some shapes on the way, it does gradually add in a few clever ways to make you think. Multiple types of shapes that need to be pulled into the correct hole, hooks you can click to flip them to one side, you can hook into another hook to pull it around and much more.</p>
<p>You will need to study the whole level before you start moving anything around to get a feel for where things need to be placed. Some of them are quite…puzzling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8698838091662395103gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8698838091662395103gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From what the developer Robert C. Wahler told me, this seems like the final game in the series too. Speaking about the release the developer told me: "SiNKR 3 is a wordless puzzler that introduces mechanics gradually and attempts to maximize the “aha” moments and make the player feel smart. I hear the first two games did just that.".</p>
<p>It's a thoroughly relaxing game too and the simplicity really is the key on this one. Some simple tunes to listen to, gameplay that doesn't really tell you anything that you just figure out as you go but never too frustrating since you can do a multi-step undo and restart at any point. There's just no failure here, you go at your own pace. Then you get to the later levels and realise I was lying about how relaxing it is because you'll be clawing at your brain for an answer. It has a great mix of easing you in and then hitting you with the challenge.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oFy6Yg_YYyY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3508d2e746f48304c26e7b7e9d5306e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oFy6Yg_YYyY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carried over from SiNKR and SiNKR 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial levels (no SiNKR experience needed).</li>
<li>Advanced levels allow for multiple solutions.</li>
<li>No scores, no timers, no distractions.</li>

      <title>The Kubuntu Focus NX is a small and mighty Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Kubuntu Focus team recently announced the <a href="https://kfocus.org/spec/spec-nx.html" target="_blank">Kubuntu Focus NX</a>, a small but surprisingly mighty little Linux desktop.

      <title>JSAUX announce their new Steam Deck Dock with an M.2 SSD slot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more storage space for your Steam Deck when docked up to a TV or monitor? JSAUX have returned with their next-generation Steam Deck Dock and it sounds pretty interesting.</p>
<p>I've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">thoroughly impressed</a> with their first two models, as I continue using the upgraded version of the original all the time. It works great but they clearly wanted to push the boat out with this one. With a whole new design that incorporates a M.2 SSD, you're not going to run out of space any time soon when using it.</p>
<p>From the press release it launches on September 7 at 7AM PST / 2PM UTC and will have a $99 early-bird price for the first 100 orders, the normal price will be $129. So this is clearly a lot more of a premium option compared to their first attempts. They will also be offering the M.2 Dock with a couple different SSDs bundled at various prices.</p>

<p>My one complaint remains the same as their previous models, with the Ethernet slot annoyingly being on the side which makes it stick out in a bit of an awkward way. Other than that, the design looks pretty lovely.</p>

      <title>Psychological horror detective adventure Saint Kotar gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nearly a whole year after the release, the point and click psychological horror detective adventure game Saint Kotar now has a Native Linux version available. This was crowdfunded on Kickstarter back in 2020 with €50,178 in funding, so it's nice to see it successfully deliver, although more than a little late.</p>
<p>"In this story-and-choice driven psychological horror detective game, you play as Benedek and Nikolay – two troubled godly men in search for their missing relative in an ancient God-devoted town called Sveti Kotar. Here, an unknown presence preys upon the weak and sways on devil worship and witchcraft. Evidence points to your missing relative being involved in the grisly murders and the occult, but what is the truth? Are you also to blame for what happened?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x0-wUltXxlc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc4f28bf32d0b92824a9014530b56a37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x0-wUltXxlc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve the mystery behind your relative's involvement with the town's bizarre and morbid rituals.</li>
<li>Switch between two realities to get to the bottom of the town’s horrifying secrets.</li>
<li>Take caution as your choices will affect both story and gameplay.</li>
<li>Discover hidden locations and complete side tasks to uncover the whole story.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Martyr Entertainment CEO Marko Tominić said this about the game: “I love a good mystery, weird, dark stories. I love them, so I want to create them as well. I believe we succeeded in that, as the most praised aspect of the game is the story, and the atmosphere that is the essential part of it.".</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/saint-kotar?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358530/Saint_Kotar/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/saint_kotar" target="_blank">GOG</a> do not have the new Linux build.</p>

      <title>Scathe is definitely not the FPS experience I was expecting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scathe is a brand new FPS from Damage State and Kwalee that seemed interesting from some previews before release. I took a look and did not come away impressed. You could say I'm being scathing of this one. It does work out of the box on Linux desktop and Steam Deck but that's about where the good points end. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>You are Scathe, a bright-white eyed enforcer forged by the "Divine Creator" tasked with travelling through a maze of demons. It's a very simplistic setup, and you can pretty much do-away with any kind of story intro here and lose nothing of value.</p>
<p>While it does have a nice idea it just felt weak and honestly, so many games have done it better. You do clearly get a feeling that it's a version of Doom left at the bottom of a bargain bin before pretty much everyone started shopping for games online. The biggest problem is that it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It's fast as hell like an arena shooter but offers up enemy AI that just runs at you in a line. Add to that the unlimited ammo and no reload of the first weapon and it's just not fun.</p>
<p>Seriously, the amount of times I've stood still and just held my finger down as enemies lined up to be killed — what's going on? There are some enemies that don't do that but they might just walk aimlessly, or spawn right in front of you and explode on you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qpFCOMXthzs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c739d7f515c084f59b9d45d68895b5ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qpFCOMXthzs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's also supposed to be a bullet hell but it's far from it. For a bullet hell, it has a surprising lack of enemies that actually swarm you properly and fire plenty, which is often due to the very simplistic AI. Not only that but you are so fast you can just pretty much run past everything, add the dash ability to your normal speed and why even fire a bullet unless you absolutely get cornered (not very often at all). Honestly the only time I found it to be hell were the annoying shrieking bouncing balls that explode at you, but even those don't swarm in enough to be much of an issue.</p>
<p>This could have been a good game but it's just buried under boring gunplay, frustrating enemies and nothing to really make it stand out from other better shooters that are either cheaper or around the same price.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/scathe?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154830/Scathe/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Various BioShock games get a 2K Launcher calling it a &#39;Quality of Life Update&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Apparently now a Quality of Life Update means adding a launcher to existing games and breaking them, if you're 2K that is.</p>
<p>Just recently BioShock Remastered 1 &amp; 2, plus BioShock Infinite all had this "Quality of Life Update". Expecting some sort of bug-fix and polishing that the name implies, it was nothing of the sort. Instead, the patch notes for all three simply state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week's update features various quality-of-life improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account linking option added in-game</li>
<li>The addition of a new Launcher which includes a Store to purchase new content</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For BioShock Infinite I can confirm the update breaks launching the older Native Linux port from Virtual Programming. Not great for those of you sticking to Native versions and paid for that.</p>
<p>Looking over various reports, many people are mentioning that the launcher update has <em>broken</em> all three for them on Steam Deck. Confusing though, as testing all three across desktop Linux and Steam Deck and all three worked out of the box for me with Proton 7.0-4 and no other changes and I wasn't even shown a launcher on Steam Deck. All good, until I tried running them again on desktop and sometimes the launcher just doesn't show up so they don't run. Frustrating.</p>
<p><em>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">see my video guide</a> on how to switch between Proton versions or a Native Linux build if it exists.</em></p>
<p>Infinite was noted to be <em>Unsupported</em> on Steam Deck anyway, but forcing Proton 7 makes it work in my testing.</p>
<p>As for BioShock Remastered 1 &amp; 2, neither of them had a Native Linux version so players on desktop Linux and Steam Deck were using Proton. The problem here is that both had been through Deck Verified with the first being "Playable" and the second being "Verified".</p>
<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/x4wk6w/how_to_bypass_the_2k_launcher_on_bioshock/in2ug1j/" target="_blank">community</a> has stepped in to provide multiple workarounds for these games if the launcher has broken them for you. If you add these as a launch option (under Properties for each game) it <em>should</em> work for all titles across desktop Linux and Steam Deck to skip the launcher and I've tested them personally working:</p>
<p>BioShock Remastered 1:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">bash -c 'exec "${@/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe/Build\/Final\/BioshockHD.exe}"' -- %command% -nointro</code></p>
<p>BioShock Remastered 2:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">bash -c 'exec "${@/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe/Build\/Final\/Bioshock2HD.exe}"' -- %command% -nointro</code></p>
<p>BioShock Infinite:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">bash -c 'exec "${@/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe/Binaries\/Win32\/BioShockInfinite.exe}"' -- %command% -nointro</code></p>
<p>There's been a <u>lot</u> of unhappy gamers on Windows too, so 2K have a bit of a storm brewing with all three titles getting negative reviews on Steam. Hopefully they will learn from this. It's just another reminder of the problem with launchers and publishers just stuffing them into games with no real benefit to users.</p>

      <title>A genre is born: Horde games</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors entered Steam Early Access in December 2021, and was described by the developer as "a gothic horror casual game with rogue-lite elements." The game skyrocketed to success almost immediately, and at time of writing has over 100,000 Steam reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.</p>
<p>The game sees you fighting off massive waves of enemies with increasingly powerful abilities. The mix of arcadey action, roguelike randomization, run-based gameplay, and a low price point was a massive success, and, predictably, Vampire Survivors inspired a whole industry of similar titles. Thus we are left with the question: what are the key elements of the genre that exploded into existence with the success of Vampire Survivors?</p>
<p>While many elements were present in earlier games, like Crimsonland in particular, Vampire Survivors was actually inspired by a mobile game named Magic Survival. Whether by refinement of its predecessors' formulae or blind luck, Vampire Survivors has brought these elements to the masses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18084453771662152541gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18084453771662152541gol1142.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Let's call games in this genre horde games. It's not a bad name; you do indeed fight a horde, and it evokes the "survival horde modes" from older shooters; typically an ancillary game mode where players fight to survive as long as possible against impossible odds. How do we define a horde game? Allow me to suggest the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li> Run-based gameplay where you survive as a single character against hordes of enemies</li>
<li> Create a build during your run by choosing from randomized abilities and powerups</li>
<li> A dramatic increase in player power and enemy numbers/difficulty during the run</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>The primary objective of each run is to survive rather than progress in the traditional sense. There are no checkpoints or levels, but rather different maps to play your run on. There are notable horde games where your run progress through stages, but the stages are weakly differentiated - not comparable to, say, moving to a new stage in Dead Cells. These games also typically have strong meta-progression elements through unlockable characters, stages, and powerups. I am loathe, however, to<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/39049601/view/3208260558159850714" target="_blank"> include meta-progression as a fundamental property of the genre</a>, as one could remove meta-progression from all of these titles and be left with essentially the same game (and besides, what run-based game doesn't have meta-progression these days?).</p>
<p>A crucial element of the horde game is the randomization of power-ups. The classic setup sees you given three or four choices each level-up, with the possibility of re-rolling your choices at some cost. This is the primary roguelike influence, as the random variation forces players to adapt to each run and build a strategy around the random power-ups they have access to. This makes each run feel unique, adding a massive amount of replayability.</p>
<p>Finally, although a little less tangible than the other two criteria, is the idea of rapid growth in player power and enemy difficulty. Indeed, in the description of Vampire Survivors the dev states that the power-ups are there to "rapidly snowball" the player against the enemy hordes. In this way each run feels like a distillation of the power creep of a traditional RPG; you start the run extraordinarily weak, struggling to overcome groups of rats, bats, and slimes, and end the run as a demigod, vanquishing masses of enemies immediately as they appear.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other attributes of horde games. Aesthetically, they are generally top-down, two-dimensional, and somewhat visually simple to keep things manageable when the horde really ramps up.  Horde games are also (no doubt thanks to VS) priced extraordinarily affordably: typically 2-3$ USD. Indeed it's possible that, thanks to their high replayability, the Horde game genre offers some the highest average playtime-per-dollar in any genre.</p>
<p>Let's take a brief look at a few of the better genre offerings <em>not</em> called Vampire Survivors.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Nomad Survival</h4>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3247206141662152865gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3247206141662152865gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
Nomad Survival sticks close to the horde game formula. It plays very similarly to Vampire Survivors, but feels more complex and nuanced. You can learn more active and passive skills and figuring out a good build is crucial to making it past the ten-minute mark. There are some excellent additions to the genre that Nomad Survival brings, including mouse control of your character, fine-tuning of run difficulty, pets, and "heritages" - powerful run modifiers that affect how you play. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1929870/Nomad_Survival/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>20 Minutes to Dawn</h4>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13368811741662152974gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13368811741662152974gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
Perhaps the most popular successor to Vampire Survivors is 20 Minutes to Dawn, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/20-minutes-till-dawn-is-like-vampire-survivors-with-guns-m-goodbye-free-time/" target="_blank">which we have covered</a>. The primary innovation here is to trade out the typically passive abilities (in the sense that they don't require targeting) with a twin-stick shooter style of gameplay. Upgrades improve the properties of your gun, turning your pea-shooter into a weapon of mass destruction. The dark, high contrast colour palette is nearly monochrome, and an appropriately foreboding synth soundtrack accompanies each run.

A <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/boneraiser-minions-is-probably-my-next-100-hour-indie-obession/" target="_blank">particular favourite</a> of GamingOnLinux, Boneraiser Minions swaps out the character's direct-damage abilities with the ability to raise a host of undead minions that defend your character. The visual aesthetic and audio are excellent, and the minions mechanic notably changes the gameplay to make for a more evasive protagonist than other horde titles.

<h4>Soulstone Survivors</h4>

Soulstone Survivors is a 3d entry into the genre, and a ton of fun. Rather than damage-on-touch, the game telegraphs enemy attacks with danger zones, which I found makes for more forgiving and enjoyable gameplay. There's a ton of status effects you can apply to enemies, and thanks to a great set of 3D animations the combat feels especially satisfying. Try the prelude <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113430/Soulstone_Survivors_Prologue/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In addition to the games mentioned here, we can include <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/halftime-heroes-is-basically-a-3d-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">Halftime Heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/grim-horde-is-chaotic-and-theres-a-good-game-hiding-in-there/" target="_blank">Grim Horde</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/void-scrappers-is-an-upcoming-space-horde-shooter-inspired-by-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a>, Spellbook Demonslayers, and Neophyte as worthy genre entries. There are plenty of games that may not be horde games proper, but feature similar enough gameplay to warrant a mention. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/just-king-blends-vampire-survivors-action-with-slay-the-spire-progression/" target="_blank">Just King</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a> are two excellent games with horde-like gameplay, but stray from the formula in interesting ways.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Have a game to include or criteria to change in our noble pursuit of defining gaming's newest genre?</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Toxoids Species Pack coming with a free update on September 20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive has announced some more goodies coming for Stellaris with the Toxoids Species Pack and a free update landing on September 20th.</p>
<p>"Rise from the primordial ooze all the way to the stars and stake your claim with the hardiest, most stubborn species in the game’s history with Toxoids, a Species Pack bubbling with visual and mechanical additions to the myriad worlds of Stellaris. Empires featuring the Toxoids species can grow and adapt faster than most creatures, but tend to make life unpleasant for their neighbors - and often for themselves."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="voDMl86jK7k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/995b74c284d65e0a813b630c3e3d6640.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/voDMl86jK7k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Origins:</strong>    

	<ul>
<li><em>Knights of the Toxic God:</em> In the depths of your homeworld, rumors rumble of a true power buried under the toxic sludge. Do you dare to dredge up the secrets of your past - and potentially unleash them upon the galaxy?</li>
<li><em>Overtuned:</em> The candle that burns the brightest, burns itself into the galaxy’s memory! Play as a species that can gain more and more traits at the cost of its own lifespan, and live for today without worrying about sticking around for tomorrow!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Civics:</strong>    
	<ul>
<li><em>Toxic Baths:</em> Grow your population fast with a fresh infusion of mutagenic sludge - so long as you’re willing to tolerate the costs to your planet and your people!</li>
<li><em>Scavengers:</em> One empire’s trash is your empire’s treasure! Don’t be too proud to harvest debris and destruction for quick construction projects of your own.</li>
<li><em>Relentless Industrialists:</em> If you’re going to keep up with demand, you’re going to have to learn to ignore all of those petty regulations and negative opinions. The surviving population will thank you for all of the resources you gain!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Traits:</strong>    
	<ul>
<li><em>Incubator:</em> Repopulate quickly when your planet is empty, but those growth facilities can fill up fast!</li>
<li><em>Inorganic Breath:</em> Your own people are a source of valuable exotic gasses! It’s a shame the respirators are so expensive.</li>
<li><em>Noxious:</em> Other species can’t stand being around you, and it seems like your mere existence is making your planets awful places to live. On the other hand, other empires have a very difficult time wanting to fight or subjugate you, and it’s hilarious to see the look on their faces when you’re in the room!</li>
<li><em>Exotic Metabolism:</em> You’ve adapted to ask “are you going to eat that?” where other species would be calling the hazmat team. Eat faster, live longer, and enjoy a terrifying rainbow of flavors!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Cosmetics:</strong> Species portraits, ship models, and cityscapes that only a mother could love.</li>
<li><strong>New Advisor:</strong> Grow your empire alongside a relentless source of noxious sarcasm!</li>

      <title>Splitgate development is over, as the devs move onto their next game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/" target="_blank">Splitgate</a>, the first-person shooter with portals, is no longer getting actively developed as the developer has seemingly given up with it to move onto a new game.</p>
<p>Announced in various places like their <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/important-announcement-about-splitgates-future" target="_blank">official blog</a>, it reads like they were trying to salvage something that needed too much work to become better "we’ve spent a lot of our time trying to rework old content and systems that were originally built by a handful of people" and "in order to build the game fans deserve – and to build it in a way that isn’t trying to retrofit and live operate an existing product – we are ending feature development of Splitgate".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9332497301662136030gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9332497301662136030gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So they're now instead moving onto a new game that sounds very much like it will just be Splitgate 2. They said it will be a "shooter, it will have portals, and it will be built in Unreal Engine 5" and it will also be free.</p>
<p>The good news for fans of Splitgate, is that it's not actually going anywhere. They will keep it all online, it may get bug fixes here and there and a fresh free Battle Pass is rolling out on September 15 but that seems like the last of new stuff for it. They also have an <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> up for any burning questions you might have.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At one point it seemed like it was going to truly be the next big thing. In August of 2021 around the time of their Open Beta, it saw a high of over 60,000 people playing at once. That was short lived though, with it losing the majority of that over only a few months. It rarely sees more than 2,000 online at any time now.</p>
<p>So they're not saying it directly, but it clearly wasn't the continued success they were likely hoping for and with all the funding they gathered initially — they're trying to do something else.</p>

      <title>Move over Wordle, I&#39;m all about Farmbound now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is the hype of Wordle over yet? Okay good. Need something new to try each day? Why not take a little look over at <a href="https://kryogenix.org/farmbound/" target="_blank">Farmbound</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for this little browser game is simple but I love it. You combine seeds to make crops, combine crops to make fields and then harvest nearby crops and fields for points. Oh, you can also use water and fertilise them to grow too but you don't get a choice in what you get as it rotates what it gives you to place down on the board.</p>
<p>The idea is just to get the best score for the day, until you can try a different one the next day. It's a daily bit of match-3 browser-based fun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16595875331662121246gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16595875331662121246gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can also follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/FarmBoundGame" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, where they seem to be giving out what the first lot of pieces you'll be getting each day are to help you plan — not that it helps me, I'm clearly too dumb for this as well. The pieces are the same for the whole day though, so you can just restart if you wish that keeps it nice and relaxed.</p>

      <title>[I] Doesn&#39;t Exist: AI Breathes New Life Into Text Adventures</title>
      <author>FergusOSullivan</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure-is-one-you-need-to-try/" target="_blank">[I] Doesn’t Exist </a>is an up-and coming text-based game by LUAL Games that will combine old-school adventuring with modern design, most notably a narrative AI that promises to smooth out the player experience. We caught up with the developers at Gamescom 2022 in Cologne, Germany to see how this ambitious project is progressing.</p>
<p><a href="https://lual.games/" target="_blank">LUAL Games</a> is made up of two recent graduates who studied game design, Luzia Hüttenmoser and Anna-Lena Pontet, both from Zürich, Switzerland. <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> started as a bachelor’s project that quickly took on a life of its own, especially one it was picked up by ProHelvetia, a Swiss arts council.</p>
<p>Further funding was secured by setting up a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/i-doesnt-exist/i-doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign and launching a demo for the game via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://lulatschia.itch.io/i-doesnt-exist" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. However, the team’s modest goal of 10,000 Swiss francs (roughly £9,000) was overshot by a massive margin and a total of nearly CHF25,000 (about £21,000) was raised.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing,” says Luzia, the game’s artist, “you never know what to expect when starting out.” Both developers emphasize that everything about their new-found situation is a first: it’s their first game, their first Kickstarter, even their first time engaging with the media. To have their demo be as successful as it is was a huge relief after what Luzia calls a “stressful and nerve-wracking” experience.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>There’s little doubt in either Luzia or Anna-Lena’s mind that it’s the demo that propelled the <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> Kickstarter campaign to its dizzying success, and playing it you’re tempted to agree. Tasked with the mission to open a mysterious door set in a tree, the player makes their way through a forest, collecting items and solving puzzles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7291102321662120225gol13804.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7291102321662120225gol13804.png"/></a></p>
<p>The demo -- which will also be the game’s first act out of three -- is a relatively straightforward affair: there’s a clear linear progression from your starting point to the end, about half an hour later. As simple as it is, though, you can already feel the work the artificial intelligence is doing, there’s none of the clunky interaction like in the text adventures of yesteryear. </p>
<p>For example, to open up a radio with a screwdriver, you just need to type “open radio” and the AI will figure out that you meant to do so with the screwdriver you have in your inventory. You don’t have to remove each screw one by one like in older games, or tape up cats like Gabriel Knight did.</p>
<p>The demo ends after about thirty minutes of gameplay with a great hook, one that both twists what the player thought they were doing as well as teasing greater adventures once the full game comes out. It needs to be played to be believed, but you’ll probably walk away wanting to pledge a few bob to Kickstarter yourself once you experience it.</p>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<p>The game is set to come out some time in mid 2023, and meanwhile the team is hard at work getting it finished. The demo that was shown at Gamescom has a few improvements already over the downloadable version, such as some added visual effects, like seeing leaves fall in a slow breeze in the forest. </p>
<p>Another update affects gameplay more drastically, adding text effects that convey the player character’s state of mind and could very well affect your own. If the player character is anxious or angry, for example, the text will become bigger and also take on different colors. It’s a simple, but effective addition. Other planned features include better animations for the player character, as well as a bigger role for the mushroom you met in the demo. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17168115761662120226gol13804.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17168115761662120226gol13804.png"/></a></p>
<p>Anna-Lena, the game’s coder, is also planning to further improve the AI. “It makes for a much smoother experience for the player,” she says, “but also means a lot less work for us.” Though the AI in <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> is still entirely reactive -- it only responds to player input, it can’t work out anything on its own -- by further refining it Anna-Lena should be able to avoid manually entering different options for commands, for example. “Using the AI makes it a lot easier to add things on the fly.”</p>
<p>If <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> will prove a success on launch, Anna-Lena hopes that both LUAL Games and other studios will be able to use narrative AI to make better games across the spectrum, or even create tools that will help creators of all stripes make their dreams come alive. For now, though, they’re putting their noses to the grindstone and getting their current project done. We’re looking forward to seeing the finished product.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 28.0 rolled out with HDR, 10-bit, Qt 6 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio is the free and open source video content creation kit for livestreaming and recording. Probably the best software in the world for it and OBS Studio 28.0 is out now. It's how I create all my videos and do any livestreaming too!</p>
<p>Some of the big new features included in this release are 10-bit and HDR Video Encoding Support, however, that is mainly for Windows as right now the Linux stack just isn't ready for it but work is ongoing on all fronts towards it in various places. So eventually we should see it too. The toolkit they use for the user interface saw a major version upgrade with Qt 6, making it easier for them to keep updating the UI in future too.</p>
<p>Changes just for the Linux client include:</p>

      <title>dbrand reveal the full details of Project Killswitch for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After waiting quite some time, Project Killswitch from dbrand for the Steam Deck is finally coming but there's been a few changes and it seems not everyone is happy with it.</p>
<p>This is the special case and solid protection for the Steam Deck that dbrand has been teasing for months now, with a reservation fee that was about $3. Now they've announced that it launches on September 25th but it has been split across two packages. Shipping is free for USA + Canada but everywhere else the cost will depend on what exactly you order and dbrand said in their usual marketing speak "If you don't like it, move.".</p>
<p>The "Essential Kit" will cost $59.95 and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1522692534937526272" target="_blank">Project Killswitch Case</a></li>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1540402838504968201" target="_blank">Magnetic Kickstand</a></li>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1496291413771829253" target="_blank">Customizable Skin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For an extra $15.00, the Travel Kit adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1497352475602530305" target="_blank">Travel Cover</a></li>
<li>2x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1551997011808903168" target="_blank">Stick Grips</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What's different is not just that it's been split in two, but their announcement didn't even mention the screen protector that was supposed to come with it. In a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/x3elm7/comment/imp8b1k/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">comment</a>, they attempted to clear that up by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="_a5_x7qimk18YbGSwE8Fy">
<div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root">
<p>Screen protectors are indeed a part of the project and have been in-market for about 6 months. Our data indicates the majority of Project Killswitch reservations holders have already purchased a screen protector from us.</p>
<p>As a result, there was no unique kit created which bundled this component in. Rather than creating a kit which would be redundant for the majority of reservation-holders that already own a screen protector, we opted to simply make the screen protector an optional add-on to the Project Killswitch UI.</p>
<p>In other words: if you're among the minority of reservation holders that hasn't purchased a screen protector yet, you will still be able to on the Project Killswitch UI. It just won't be built into a "Kit" option.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The announcement also didn't mention that reservations are supposed to get free Stick Grips but they later cleared that up in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/x3elm7/comment/impbgza/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">comment</a> to confirm reservations do still get those.</p>
<p>They've had a <em>surprising</em> amount of backlash on Reddit about the changes they've made to it, with the Steam Deck Reddit seeing quite a lot of unhappy comments about it. dbrand at least seem to offer refunds of the $3 reservation fee if you're unhappy.</p>
<p>With dbrand coming out pretty late on this, with multiple options already out there like the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> stand or the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-stand-protector" target="_blank">Standing Case</a> from JSAUX, I do have to wonder how their sales of this will go down.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Beta updated with Mode Shift support in Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues tweaking and improving the Steam Deck software both the Steam Client and SteamOS. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3370402903759152855" target="_blank">new Beta</a> is available with more improvements to Steam Input. This is available for anyone in the Beta or Preview update channels. You can change it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>I've seen quite a few complaints and worries that as Valve gradually replaces the old Steam Input configurator with the new one (which will come to desktop too), that features were missing. Seems Valve are listening, since this adds in Mode Shifts to the newer one on the Steam Deck amongst other things.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slider controls now allow more precise input for large ranges, and accelerate changing the value the longer left/right is held.</li>
<li>Fixed up and down direction on gamepad sometimes skipping rows on the keyboard when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Fix errors when operating emoji keyboard in Steam and desktop modes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for Mode Shifts in the new configurator</li>
<li>Fix a case where two controllers could show the same slot in the Controller Reorder screen</li>
<li>Fix a case where a controller could not show up in-game until the overlay was toggled</li>
<li>Fix the Page Up/Down glyphs being swapped in virtual menus</li>
<li>Fix an issue where Switch controllers could show up w/ a duplicate device</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam continues the slow climb, SteamOS rises</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another month has finished and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=combined" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> has been refreshed. It shows once again that the Linux user share has risen.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> has been updated as usual but here's the chart to save you a click:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1064900451662103696gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1064900451662103696gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When you go to the Linux details page, these are the most popular distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 13.69% +6.09%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.89% -2.98%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 8.93% -2.47%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 8.20% +8.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 7.06% -2.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 4.54% -1.75%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.46% -0.44%</li>
<li>Flatpak runtime 64 bit 4.34% +4.34%</li>
<li>Other 37.89% +6.29%</li>
</ul>
<p>It's probably no surprise then that the most popular GPU currently being used on Linux is the Steam Deck too. The Steam Deck GPU accounts for 13.72% of Linux gamers on Steam, with the next most popular being the AMD Radeon RX 480 at 4.81%.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Steam Deck and SteamOS are taking over Linux Gaming and rather quickly too. Interestingly, if you filter to Windows, the Steam Deck GPU doesn't even show up so it's likely overall only a tiny amount of people are actually using Windows on it.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes releases next week, other DLC prices going up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive has announced the Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes event pack releases September 8 and they also mentioned some price rises.</p>
<p>Firstly, mentioned in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck3-changes-to-flavor-pack-pricing.1538700/" target="_blank">forum post</a>, the price of Flavor Packs (like Northern Lords and Fate of Iberia) will increase from 6.99 USD to 12.99 USD. Paradox said this was to "reflect the overall value of this kind of content moving forward" so expect that price for future similar packs starting September 13. However, the main game and the Royal Court expansion prices remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Also Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes was announced that arrives on September 8. This is an event pack, <em>not</em> a big expansion, adding in over 100 new events and a bunch of new music to accompany you on your conquests:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jOFJ4TfJ1tg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b257bfbd5713a7b1fd9398625495cb0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jOFJ4TfJ1tg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Crusader Kings III is simply one of the best games they've made to me, next to Stellaris for having plenty of depth and not being completely overwhelming and confusing like some of their other titles. I must admit my temptation to get a whole bunch more events is something.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper has a new roadmap with a mini-update due soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper, the delightful pixel-art mining sandbox adventure that you can play solo or online with friends has a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/3242049605274459372" target="_blank">roadmap</a>. It sounds pretty exciting too with a mini-update coming out soon.</p>
<p>For the small update coming this month, they're going to be adding in various decorative features, which they say are based on direct requests from the community. That's just really to keep us going until the bigger update, The Desert of Beginnings, due in November which will add in the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new biome — Desert of Beginnings</li>
<li>A new sub-biome — Molten Quarry</li>
<li>Ra-akar The Sand Titan (sounds like a boss mob)</li>
<li>Multiple new enemies</li>
<li>A new vehicle</li>
<li>Steam Achievements</li>
<li>New material: Galaxite</li>
<li>+ more to be revealed</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before that, they have a spooky seasonal event due for Halloween in October so that should be fun too! Plus a Christmas event planned for December and then even further out a Crystal Biome planned but no date on it.</p>
<p>Their previous big update trailer if you missed it:</p>

<p>Whenever I manage to get some proper free time, I can't wait to dive into this one properly for many hours. From what I played of the early game, it was wonderful.</p>

      <title>Cross-vendor Mesh Shading for the Vulkan API is now here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today the Vulkan API specification 1.3.226 was released and it brings with it an exciting new extension with VK_EXT_mesh_shader. This was worked on by people from NVIDIA, Valve, Intel, ARM, QUALCOMM, Igalia and AMD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This extension provides a new mechanism allowing applications to generate collections of geometric primitives via programmable mesh shading. It is an alternative to the existing programmable primitive shading pipeline, which relied on generating input primitives by a fixed function assembler as well as fixed function vertex fetch.</p>
<cite>Vulkan API <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap50.html#VK_EXT_mesh_shader" target="_blank">documentation</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons it's important, is that it not only brings cross-vendor mesh shading to Vulkan succeeding NVIDIA's own version, it also had a focus on improving compatibility with DirectX 12 so it brings us that little bit closer. Should hopefully be good for projects like Proton with VKD3D-Proton that translates Direct 3D 12 to Vulkan when running Windows games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compatibility with DirectX 12 was very important for this extension, therefore it follows the same capabilities, minimum limitations and restrictions.</p>
<cite>Christoph Kubisch, Principal Developer Technology Engineer, NVIDIA</cite></blockquote>
<p>More info available on the Khronos Group <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/mesh-shading-for-vulkan" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>To go along with it, NVIDIA have a new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> version 515.49.15 available with support hooked up and ready for testing. NVIDIA also updated their open source <a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/gl_vk_meshlet_cadscene" target="_blank">example</a> to support it too. Hopefully Mesa drivers (AMD / Intel) will have it hooked up for Mesa 22.3 due later this year.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets an emergency hotfix for Epic Games Store logins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently it seems something changed over on the Epic Games Store and so third-party programs trying to login like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> would fail. Thankfully a fix was found.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/derrod/legendary" target="_blank">Legendary</a>, the name of the kit that the Heroic Games Launcher is built upon for its Epic Store integration was updated and so the Heroic Games Launcher has pulled the latest version in. With Heroic version "2.4.2 HOTFIX #2" you should be good to go on logging in and downloading games once again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4212718031662044097gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4212718031662044097gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Giving it a test myself with the new hotfix and yup — it works again. Great work to the developers doing this.</p>
<p>This is of course a good reminder that the Epic Store doesn't support Linux and the Steam Deck in any way, so they can break anything whenever they like and it's up to the people working on third-party stuff like Legendary and Heroic to figure it all out for us. This is why buying from Steam directly (or Steam keys from legit stores) is usually your best bet for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Controller support for V Rising planned, better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stunlock Studios have revealed quite a lot of their plans for V Rising, the popular open-world vampire survival game.</p>
<p>A game that can run well enough on Steam Deck and Linux desktops with the Proton compatibility layer. However, a sore spot for Steam Deck players is that there's no controller support and playing it on Deck can be a bit of a hassle. The good news is that's going to change!</p>
<p>In their "<a href="https://blog.stunlock.com/dev-update-15-future-visions/" target="_blank">Dev Update #15: Future Visions</a>" post along with many other gameplay improvements coming, this was mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players might also be happy to know that we’re looking into adding controller support, and we’re increasingly confident that it’s something that will be possible for us. This would be a major step in the direction of being able to port to consoles and other platforms, as well as offer better support for Steamdeck. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more developers paying attention!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14669197511662036087gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14669197511662036087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can buy V Rising on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/v-rising?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>These were the most popular Steam Deck games in August 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has revealed what the most popular games were on Steam Deck for August 2022, so here's the list. Announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1565067858790711296/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they have sorted it by hours played and it is once again full of unsurprising titles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
<li>Cult of the Lamb</li>
<li>ELDEN RING</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</li>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>No Man's Sky</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Multiversus</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</li>
<li>MONSTER HUNTER RISE</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all some of the most popular games on Steam as a whole, so it directly translates to what people are playing on Steam Deck it seems. All pretty good choices too! Interestingly though, it's also made clear that for a game to be popular on Steam Deck it doesn't need to be fully Verified as multiple in the list are only tagged as Playable.</p>
<p>I've done numerous videos on various games, including some of those in that very list:</p>

      <title>Arcane Waters is an upcoming open-world pixel-pirate adventure game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to sail the high seas? Love pixel artwork? Check out the upcoming game Arcane Waters which will let you do some pirating adventures alone or online with others too but it's mainly an online focused game.</p>
<p>Featuring trading, exploration, combat and of course farming as well because it seems every game needs that now too. With handcrafted environments you'll be fighting monsters, as well as other players across both land and sea. Honestly it seems like a lot of fun, like a pixel take on Sea of Thieves but with an expanded take on it. Early Access is due on November 15, check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ujOPFNhvUDQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/828af23c37d6730136930733421997b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ujOPFNhvUDQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FIGHT - When you leave the safety of your farm, you'll have to fight to survive! On the high seas, fight tense real-time cannon-blasting battles against pirates and huge monsters. On land, take part in thrilling active-time fights with strange creatures to reveal hidden treasures. You’ll need your wits about you!</li>
<li>FARM - Starting with a humble farm, plant seeds, water them and pick your crops. Eventually you will unlock other farms to increase your yield and diversify your produce.</li>
<li>Explore - A vast open world awaits you or your team as you sail to distant lands. Explore multiple different biomes, each with their own unique towns, valuable goods for sale and dangerous monsters, to complete quests and help each other level up.</li>
<li>TRADE - Whether you grow your own food, or buy it from traders, you will need to find the best price to sell and make a profit. This will mean sailing far from home to discover new continents and towns where your goods are highly sought after.</li>
<li>CRAFT - Use items dropped by enemies or sold at stores to make your own weapons and armor, and either use them yourself or sell them on the public Auction for a profit!</li>
<li>LEVEL UP - Stay neutral to avoid being attacked by other players, or join a guild to help fight for your place in the world. Level up by completing quests, finding new locations, and utilizing your skills. Use Perk points to increase stats based on your chosen specialties, and use your hard-earned gold to buy new equipment to help you progress even faster.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Early Access the developer seems to think it will be finished in 2023, depending on player feedback. Currently they said it supports "thousands of players concurrently" and some of the features they're building for it will directly involve a great many players "coordinating together in a shared experience".</p>
<p>As for the amount of content, it sounds like there's plenty ready for the initial Early Access release with the core elements ready and 4-5 unique regions, with a total of 7 regions planned. Each region has unique quests, items, foes and so on.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266340/Arcane_Waters/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Tips and Tricks Part 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since a lot of people liked the first set of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/top-quick-steam-deck-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank">tips and tricks for the Steam Deck</a>, here's a Part 2 with just a few more that some of you might find useful. Some done before in other videos or articles but this is an easy reference for you.</p>
<p>A video below going over each step, along with the text below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m_Yw0GQHs3o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d47652455dbc9c013984945519a50161.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m_Yw0GQHs3o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>First up, schedule updates to late night when you’re not on it if you don’t want games always doing a full update when you boot up. The Deck will still seem to do shader cache updates though but I’ve been doing this on desktop for years, it’s also great for those of you on limited bandwidth plans.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12800768271661960424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12800768271661960424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>If a game has a VSync option or a frame limiter, try using that instead of the one built into the performance menu on the Steam Deck, as it can add a bit of extra input lag. How much you feel it depends very much on the game but give the in-game options a try and compare, you might get a nicer experience.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> is a community-made version of Proton, the Windows translation layer for running games. At times, it <em>can</em> run games that the official Valve Proton cannot until Valve update it. Despite what some seem to think, you don’t need to use GE-Proton for everything and a lot of people don’t need it at all. However, it does have fixes for certain games, so give it a try. To set it up go into desktop mode and load up the discover software centre, then search for a program called <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> which is a handy installer. Once open, pick the version you want and hit install and wait for it to finish. Once done, back in Gaming Mode you can simply pick a game, go to the little Cog icon on the right and into Properties. Compatibility on the left, tick the box and then pick the compatibility layer you wish to use for it.</li>
<li>Want to change how you control the Steam Deck in desktop mode? Load up Steam, go into the Settings to Controller and go into Desktop Configuration. There you can change what button does what and what controls the cursor. Might make it just a little bit nicer for you like setting the Start button to the Windows key to open the Plasma menu, you can do all sorts with it (although they really need to update the style of it to the new configurator).</li>
<li>Are you not getting along with the Steam on-screen keyboard? Try out <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cubocore.CoreKeyboard" target="_blank">Core Keyboard</a>, you might find you like it more or it has less issues than the Steam On-screen keyboard. It's also a good idea to have backup, for times when Steam has issues. You can install it in Discover.</li>
<li>Just a small one, but you can drag the "return to game mode" icon onto your status panel to be able to quickly get to it without having to minimize everything to desktop.</li>
<li>Did you somehow lose your return to gaming mode shortcut for the desktop mode? Well, here’s how to add it back. Right click the desktop and create a new text file, name it whatever and paste this inside:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">[Desktop Entry]<br/>
	Name=Return to Gaming Mode<br/>
	Exec=qdbus org.kde.Shutdown /Shutdown org.kde.Shutdown.logout<br/>
	Icon=steamdeck-gaming-return<br/>
	Terminal=false<br/>
	Type=Application<br/>
	StartupNotify=false</code><br/>
<em>That's copied directly from my existing one. </em><br/>
	That’s it, save it and done. It will also only give you the warning the first time.</li>
<li>Shop around! While the Steam Deck is primarily meant for Steam and they want you to buy direct, there’s plenty of legitimate stores out there selling Steam keys that have constant sales and game bundles. These include <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/" target="_blank">Green Man Gaming</a> (and so on) and you should keep an eye on <a href="https://isthereanydeal.com/" target="_blank">IsThereAnyDeal</a> to find the best price.</li>
<li>And I will take this moment to suggest you don’t use the Epic Games Store. Buying on Steam or at least a Steam Key, will give you far better integration and just less hassle for the Deck. Like today for example, where Epic seemed to break something so Legendary and the Heroic Games Launcher <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/1754" target="_blank">wasn't able</a> to login to Epic.</li>

      <title>Futuristic drift-racer Neodash is out now on Steam and looks wild</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neodash is a fresh Native Linux racing game that combines futuristic bright neon visuals with crazy-fast drifting. What you get is something that clearly resembles the awesome racing-platformer Distance, but pumped up on some serious steroids and a little Trackmania too even.</p>
<p>Honestly, this looks absolutely awesome. Screenshots don't do it justice, have a look at the trailer below.</p>
<p>"Define your own path and survive until you reach the end that lies ahead of you by swerving, drifting and flying across traps and obstacles while avoiding the abyss. But there's a catch: the world is disintegrating at your heels; better go fast, or you might not make it.</p>
<p>Neodash plunges you in a unique sci-fi atmosphere that is brought to life by music: the environment reacts to the beat in different ways, creating a thrilling and immersive audio-visual experience."</p>

      <title>The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection releases September 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay so perhaps <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/last-call-bbs-the-final-game-from-zachtronics-has-left-early-access/" target="_blank">Last Call BBS</a> being their actual final game was a sweet little lie from Zachtronics. Well, sort of, as The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection is technically not exactly a new game.</p>
<p>Arriving on September 6, this is a bundling of all their popular solitaire games they snuck into their other older games. However, they've also gone and updated them with "4K graphics" and added a <em>bonus</em> new solitaire variant you will only find in this big collection.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O4-fywWcWLE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/404d50fccbd4742b4cc8289644956ece.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O4-fywWcWLE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shenzhen Solitaire</strong>: A FreeCell-inspired solitaire variant with a three-color deck based on mahjong tiles.</li>
<li><strong>Sigmar’s Garden</strong>: A tile matching game using the alchemical symbols from Opus Magnum.</li>
<li><strong>Proletariat’s Patience</strong>: An asymmetric solitaire variant where some cards are grouped by suit while others are stacked by alternating colors.</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: A challenging solitaire variant using Japanese kabufuda cards where additional free cells are unlocked by making sets.</li>
<li><strong>Cluj Solitaire</strong>: An original solitaire variant where you can “cheat” by placing cards wherever you want, so long as you’re careful.</li>
<li><strong>Cribbage Solitaire</strong>: A score-based solitaire variant using modified Cribbage rules and an actual Cold War aircraft recognition deck.</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: A reimagined version of Klondike that is faster, more strategic, and more often winnable than the original.</li>
<li><strong>Fortune’s Foundation</strong>: A brand new and extra-challenging solitaire variant using a deck of Tarot cards that presents a fortune when you win.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as we know though, for real, they won't be making any actual full new games because they really are moving on. Still, having all of these in one collection does seem like quite a bright idea for people who just want their Solitaire fix in a few different unique styles and ways of playing.</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1988540/The_Zachtronics_Solitaire_Collection/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Infinity Engine reimplementation GemRB continues improving Icewind Dale 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Classics like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and more running on the Infinity Engine should live on forever thanks to open source reimplementations like <a href="http://gemrb.org/" target="_blank">GemRB</a>.</p>
<p>While we do have the Enhanced Edition for many of them thanks to Beamdog, it's probable that eventually GemRB will be the best way to play all of them as we've seen with other open source reimplementations like OpenMW for Morrowind and OpenXcom for the classic X-COM. GemRB enables people to bring them to new platforms, better modding and continue improving them long into the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1323488611661946172gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1323488611661946172gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Icewind Dale 2</em></p>
<p>GemRB v0.9.1 just went up recently and here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Icewind Dale 2 can be progressed to well into chapter 5</li>
<li>Faster loading and saving, faster OpenGL rendering</li>
<li>Use magic device skill, precise shot, iwd1 bard song choice</li>
<li>SDLAudio plugin now supports ambients</li>
<li>Console history is now preserved, more text colors externalized</li>
<li>Logging is now done via fmt (bundled headers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python3 support (now the only option)</li>
<li>Unicode support (iconv not optional any more!)</li>
<li>Spellcaster ai, effects, scripting, projectiles, weapon style customization</li>
<li>Audio, drawing, appimage, ini spawns</li>
<li>Bugfixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>SokoChess combines Chess with the Sokoban block-pushing formula</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SokoChess is certainly an intriguing game blending together two very different types of gameplay, to create something that's a little peculiar but quite fun. <u>Note</u>: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>This is a minimalist puzzle game about pushing around Chess pieces into other pieces. Not as simple as it sounds though, and it will give your brain something of a workout. You might get one piece into a correct place, push your piece somewhere else only to be captured by an opposing piece you've moved somewhere.</p>
<p>Daisy Games, the developer, say it's "more than just a chess puzzle game" as it introduces various extra elements not in Chess like cracked tiles that break after moving over them, locks that need you to pick up a key and more. So it's Chess with Sokoban on steroids but somehow still minimal and relaxing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nyUJq8s-VMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7fbf218070ed98da68fb822d7246d9e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nyUJq8s-VMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You have 70 levels to play through, which like any good puzzle game start off plain and simple, with you just capturing a couple of Pawns by pushing them to the correct tile. It gradually makes the layout of the levels more complex, as it starts introducing more elements to challenge you. Some of the levels really will make your brain sweat and I am apparently far too dumb for it but I've been enjoying trying to think ahead and get it right.</p>
<p>Wonderful little gem worth picking up easily.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960400/SokoChess/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valheim gets patched to prevent the world resetting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite an important update has rolled out for the open-world survival game Valheim, with a bunch of changes related to the saving system to prevent some big problems. For a little while some people have unfortunately seen their worlds getting reset, which this patch solves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18873732421661944595gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18873732421661944595gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Autobackup system added that will keep one 2-hour and one 12-hour backup by default and can be customised in misc settings. Default setting on dedicated servers is 4, which can be customised with new parameters (-backups -backupshort -backuplong).</li>
<li>The game will now save after you sleep, or at 30 minute intervals, and the timer is reset when using the manual save console command. The save interval can be customised on dedicated servers using the new parameter (-saveinterval).</li>
<li>Using the console save command now also saves the character file</li>
<li>The dedicated server manual PDF has been updated with the new parameters.</li>
<li>World save gets disabled if it’s a corrupted world file or if it’s an incompatible world version and the game will return to the main menu. Dedicated servers will shut down if the world is corrupt.</li>
<li>A change to Steam Cloud saves to avoid a particular crash during saves that could corrupt the world save.</li>
<li>The game returns to a pause state if a multiplayer host is alone in a multiplayer session if all players leave (like it was previously).</li>
<li>Players can no longer create a world with the same name when Steam Cloud saves are enabled.</li>
<li>Characters with duplicate filenames will now be hidden.</li>
<li>Characters with different names from the filename will be displayed to differentiate between renamed files</li>
<li>Local and legacy characters will now be deleted properly if Steam Cloud is enabled</li>
<li>Beehive VFX on-hit fix</li>
<li>Removed the ability to craft/build the Midsummer items</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Victoria 3 from Paradox Interactive releasing October 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox has today confirmed that Victoria 3 will be releasing on October 25, plus it's available for pre-order with a new trailer too.</p>
<p>"Victoria 3 is a deep socio-economic and political simulation that endeavors to represent the needs and desires of every person on earth across a century of dramatic technological and social upheaval. Growing populations will have to be fed, but they will also make political demands to increase or maintain their power. Pass laws and social reforms to reflect the wishes of your citizens, or try to impose a brighter future on a nation that may not appreciate your forward thinking."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZZhUadmaP8M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/686063972290dbfdc097c93958e0843c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZZhUadmaP8M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Infinite Replayability: Rewrite history as any of dozens of nations from the Victorian Era, from industrial powerhouses like Great Britain and Prussia to populous giants like Russia and Qing China or powers in waiting like Japan or Colonial Canada.</li>
<li>Deep Societal Simulation: Every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, whether farmer or clerk, capitalist or craftsman. Each has personal beliefs, political preferences and, most importantly, a standard of living to maintain.</li>
<li>Challenging Economic Gameplay: Develop your economy through the development of new industries and institutions, trading surplus goods to the many markets of the world and importing what your population needs to make life affordable.</li>
<li>Diplomatic Brinkmanship: Anything you can win through war can also be achieved at the negotiating table. Open diplomatic plays, calling on allies for support, as you press demands on weaker or rival nations.</li>
<li>Political Development: Manage the various political factions in your country through laws and reforms. Can you improve the life of your citizens, if it means angering established authorities?</li>
<li>A Living World: Watch the map change before your eyes, as newly constructed railways run between burgeoning cities, many of which were mere hamlets decades before.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Until now, they were only confirming Windows support for it but as of now for the pre-order it appears that both macOS and Linux are back up on the Steam page. The system requirements are still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Available to pre-order now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> it will cost around $49.99 / £41.99 / €49.99 at release.</p>
