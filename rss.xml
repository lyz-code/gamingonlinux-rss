      <title>LEGO Voyagers looks super sweet and arrives for co-op play on September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Light Brick Studio and Annapurna Interactive have announced that LEGO Voyagers will arrive for your next co-op session on September 15th. This looks like possibly the cutest LEGO game yet.</p>
<p>Now this I'm going to have to get, once me and my gaming partner get through our current session of It Takes Two. I really do love how this offers up both local and online co-op, and if you're playing at a distance online only one of you needs to own it with the Friend Pass system — excellent stuff.</p>
<p>Check out the short new trailer that arrived with the release date news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1J4Zq-A6FAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b90a59ccdbb5f102486dd9c4e4dc22e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the makers of LEGO® Builder's Journey comes a new 2-player co-op adventure about friendship and play. When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rally Arcade Classics to expand with the Precision &amp; Chase update on September 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more rally games? Rally Arcade Classics looks like a good one and it's expanding with a free update on September 9th.</p>
<p>The game currently offers 44 iconic cars from different eras (70's, 80's and 90's) with a license-based progression system, so you have to train your driving skills to unlock different modes before driving legendary cars. This is not a standard arcade rally racer though, with more physics to provide something in between arcade and pro rally games. The Precision &amp; Chase will bring with it a new manual transmission mode, a revamped speedometer and a new online friends list with high scores.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CwYAgcSMzWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab275a77681f77cbc88a055eaf4d8b8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CwYAgcSMzWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We devoted two hard years to create this game with a passionate team and one goal: to combine elements from different eras of racing games and keep an accessible experience for both veteran and new fans of the genre” - Salvador Casamiquela, co-founder at NETK2GAMES.</p>
<p>It actually has a Native Linux version, but last I checked it was tweaked specifically for the Steam Deck, with no graphics options so it's all pre-set. You may want to use Proton to get access to everything properly. It's currently Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>You&#39;ve built cities with people, beavers, on top of giant creatures - and now you&#39;ll do it with Crows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowded was just announced as a new city-builder but it's all about nesting, since your people are Crows. Crowded is a crow city builder where you strategically design a nest-city to support and shelter your flock. Engineer, scavenge and explore your way to a self-sustaining society in the sky.</p>
<p>More about it: "Scavenge for delicious bugs and building materials, managing resources wisely so your feathered friends get what they need. Take flight and explore a landscape of lush forests and sprawling meadows, planting new trees to expand your territory. Strategically design your nest-city to support and shelter your adorable flock. Manipulate the wind itself to influence the environment and create a form of transportation. As you innovate, you’ll also discover new technologies to lead your flock to greatness."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Nxb6ZeaFL9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8668a7ce3ffb0d80b26b971925516165.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Nxb6ZeaFL9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We wanted our game to feel truly avian. So, we came up with a design philosophy we call Featherpunk," said Alex Grenus, one of the devs at Nestwork Games. "It focuses on the anatomy of crows and their abilities. And as city builder fans, we know how enjoyable it is to watch our tiny people, animals, cars, etc go about their lives. In German (to no one's surprise) there is even a word for it 'Wuselfaktor'. We also want this in our game, so our buildings feature a lot of open space to watch the crows, and if you look closely, you can find some cute details."</p>
<p>Love the idea behind this and really can't think of another like it. Can't wait to see more.</p>

      <title>Docked is the latest big machinery simulation game from Saber Interactive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the teams that gave us SnowRunner, RoadCraft and more is Docked, a new big machinery sim about rebuilding a dock in the wake of a devastating hurricane.</p>
<p>Operate heavy machinery and vehicles, restore and upgrade the port's capabilities, and continually take on new jobs to expand the business. Another sim game fully of busy-work, but hey you get to mess with huge machines which is fun to some of us? I don't really get why though. What is it about big heavy machinery that makes us enjoy oddly tedious work?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SBguf_F3Yz4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8aa76f45a456e2735d62bef1eeebdf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SBguf_F3Yz4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You're the manager of Port Wake, and so you have to keep everything flowing to save the family business. This includes unloading huge cargo ships and establish various logistical chains and complete jobs to earn resources. No date is being given on when it might release so we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port Wake Calls</strong>: From ship to crane to truck and beyond, every job is a vital piece of the business. Manage operations and vehicles, take on important contracts, and make high-priority cargo runs to fulfill your commitments. When wear and tear drags your equipment down, execute repairs under strict deadlines to keep the port growing.</li>
<li><strong>Operate Powerful Machinery</strong>: Take command of a fleet of realistic machines, expertly engineered with the raw power and precise handling to fulfill your contracts, from colossal ship-to-shore cranes to sturdy, heavy-duty tractors and more. Tighten ropes, position materials, optimize weight distribution, navigate delicate cargo with little margin for error, and gain a firsthand understanding of what it means to work a dock.</li>
<li><strong>Earn, Invest &amp; Expand</strong>: Revitalize Port Wake one crane at a time. Every job you take earns cash to invest in new and more powerful machinery. Sign contracts to create new logistical chains and build up resources, purchase lots to store vehicles, upgrade fuel and power supplies, and conquer new milestones to save and expand the family business.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous sims worked well on Linux with Proton so I fully expect this to as well. If you on an AMD GPU that is, as it appears the most recent sim RoadCraft still has issues on NVIDIA.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors is getting an official board game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The smash-hit indie game Vampire Survivors is getting an official board game. Developer poncle have teamed up with Grey Fox Games for it but details are light.</p>
<p>As confirmed by poncle on their official <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vampire.poncle.games/post/3lwefnpkmr22c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> account, there's not really any firm details on it other than a confirmation that it exists and it's coming to Kickstarter sometime in the Autumn. So at some point between September - December.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://promotion.greyfoxgames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select Your Survivor</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose from beloved characters to battle against creatures of the night.</li>
</ul>
<p>Face Endless Swarms</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave after wave of familiar enemies relentlessly spawn and threaten your survival.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlock and power up weapons and passives</p>
<ul>
<li>Use and evolve signature weapons to cut a path through the darkness in your quest for strength and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Fear The Reaper...</p>
<ul>
<li>...because Red Death comes for us all.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a total sucker for a good board game and I do love some Vampire Survivors, so even I'm tempted by this. Once we get a proper look at it anyway, more will be revealed when the Kickstarter launches.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broken on Linux - again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh dear. A regular occurrence with THE FINALS after updates, as it's causing various problems with it kicking Linux players at the moment.</p>
<p>It might happen right away, it might take a few matches, but there's masses of reports from players on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck seeing error screens. The developers at Embark Studios have confirmed in their Discord that they're aware, and they're working on the problem as they've reached out to Proton developers and Easy Anti-Cheat developers about it.</p>
<p>Embark developer tvandijck on their Security team made it <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1235610365098987621/1405822063725383731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">clear</a> in their Discord that "I want to play on SteamDeck.. I am part of the security team, and so whatever we build... will work on steam deck" but hiccups like this will happen, since the Linux / Proton community is "less [than] 1% of our players".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13533832441755257149gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>So hopefully THE FINALS will be working properly again on Linux systems sometime soon but for now you'll have to sit tight and wait.</p>
<p>In my testing earlier it wouldn't even launch at all with Proton 9, but did run with Proton Experimental. At least until you see the issue where you get kicked.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/612045811444875471" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for the 7.9 update on Steam, they confirmed Denuvo Anti Cheat is also in testing, with it potentially rolling out <em>next</em> season on Steam but with that "Compatibility with SteamDeck and Proton has been tested as well, and we are still committed to serving that part of our community".</p>

      <title>Steam is getting wider and more responsive store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are continuing their work to modernise more of Steam, and now we're finally getting bigger and more responsive store pages. It's currently only available in the Steam Beta, which is opt-in. It's not on the web just yet - app only. Once it's ready though, it will roll out everywhere.</p>
<p>Store pages have changed from 940px to be 1200px wide, and it's responsive so it will shrink back down. Most of that extra space went to the videos and description side, which has expanded by default to 780px wide. Giving you bigger videos, screenshots and more space for the full description to pull you in a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15027163531755255111gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15027163531755255111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That's still a lot of space they could fill up with things, but the key in design is not to overload with information. At least now on wider monitors it doesn't look so ridiculously small.</p>
<p>Plus developers can now put up small videos inside their game descriptions. For a long time developers have been adding in GIFs, but their quality and sizing is pretty poor, so to help devs can now use MP4 or WebM clips. As part of this, Valve went back through all the GIFs developers uploaded (292,000 of them!) to swap them over to video files. The videos will auto-play just like GIFs, but they also now have a play/pause button on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1943332901755255216gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1943332901755255216gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hitting pause on one clip currently pauses them all.</p>
<p>And of course, Valve just had to get into the argument of how to pronounce GIF didn't they. From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q. How do you pronounce GIF, with a hard G or a soft J?</strong></p>
<p>A. We on the Steam team are pretty split on how to pronounce it. Regardless of which way you are inclined, be prepared for some heated debates should you share your opinion on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only correct way is with a hard G, as in Graphics, not Jraphics. Anything else just sounds wrong. It stands for <strong>G</strong>raphics Interchange Format after all doesn't it, and it's a hill I will plant my flag down and die on.</p>

      <title>Green Man Gaming to launch a charity bundle platform and expanding into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Green Man Gaming recently announced they're evolving, with plans for a new charity bundle platform along with expanding into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
<p>Bundles can be pretty lucrative for stores, with Fanatical and Humble doing them constantly, so now they're going to get more competition.</p>
<p>GMG said in an <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/company/news/charity-bundle-announcement/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we announced the launch of our brand <strong>new charity bundles platform</strong> - a bold step in our mission to make game discovery easier, and create new incremental revenue opportunities for developers and publishers, all while supporting charitable causes and doing something truly meaningful through <strong>gaming for good.</strong></p>
<p>Alongside this new initiative, we are also expanding into the <strong>Asia-Pacific (APAC) </strong>region to strengthen partnerships with local game developers and publishers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their first charity bundle is planned for October 2025 in support of SpecialEffect’s One Special Day, a charity that's truly worth supporting so a great one to start with. They'll have some good features for their bundles including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guaranteed key delivery</strong>-  Every bundle purchase includes<strong> instant key fulfilment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visible stock levels-</strong> Customers will see real-time stock availability before they buy</li>
<li><strong>Regional pricing-</strong> Making bundles more accessible to global audiences</li>
<li><strong>Charity first- </strong>Every bundle supports impactful causes, with a focus on local charities in key markets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Humble Bundle could definitely learn from Fanatical and GMG here on those first two points, as they have repeating issues with keys going out of stock but purchases still happening.</p>
<p>“We have built these charity bundles to be a force of positivity in an industry which has seen difficult times,” said Paul Sulyok, Founder and CEO of Green Man Gaming. “We feel the opportunity to support gaming for good, while giving publishers and developers the tools to secure incremental revenue from their products, is a win-win the games industry needs right now.”</p>
<p>They're calling on developers, publishers and charities to get in touch to get involved.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with fixes for The Crew Motorfest, Farlight 84 and more games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For August 14th Valve released another upgrade to Proton Experimental, bringing some more essential fixes for Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Confused on the different Proton versions? Be sure to read the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux guide</a>. For games that have anti-cheat be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out our compatibility page</a>. This latest follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-experimental-gets-fixes-for-dualsense-god-eater-resurrection-crysis-3-resident-evil-village-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 8th update</a> with even more improvements!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the August 14th update noted to be now playable includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefly Village</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">The other fixes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed long loading times in God Eater 2 Rage Burst.</li>
<li>Fixed Spark &amp; Kling crashing when idling on main menu.</li>
<li>Fixed multiplayer in Farlight 84.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton 10.0-2 regression that caused weird window behavior in RiME with non-native aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton 10 regressions:
	<ul>
<li>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land no longer fails to play cutscenes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a></em></p>
<p>The Crew Motorfest is an interesting one since it uses BattlEye <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>. Ubisoft seemed to have it enabled for Linux platforms at some point recently, but Proton was missing a few bits to get the game fully working which have now been added. Nice to see more games like it working!</p>

<em>Pictured - The Crew Motorfest</em></p>
<p>Also nice to see Farlight 84 get fixed again too, so that's even more multiplayer games that continue working on Linux.</p>

      <title>Blackbird Interactive take back full ownership of Hardspace: Shipbreaker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardspace: Shipbreaker developer Blackbird Interactive have announced they've broken off from Focus Entertainment.</p>
<p>In an announcement they said they've reacquired full ownership over Hardspace: Shipbreaker. As a result, they've confirmed that multiple new Hardspace projects are in development but they're not going into any real specifics on it just yet. Hardspace: Shipbreaker itself is set for a small update to reflect the change</p>
<p>In a press release Rory McGuire, President and Chief Creative Officer at Blackbird Interactive said: "It is rare to have an IP that resonates so deeply with millions of players. So we are honored to have this opportunity to deepen and expand that connection through new games that explore the Hardspace universe. Shipbreaker also wouldn’t be what it is today without our friends at Focus Entertainment. We are eternally grateful for their partnership and hope to work with them again soon."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14129926061755250931gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game runs great with Proton on Linux and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Clay-animated shoot &#39;em up Platypus Reclayed releases September 18</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Platypus Reclayed revives the classic 2002 claymation shooter for the next-generation. A demo is up now and it's releasing September 18th. I absolutely love everything about clay animation, and I have to say this looks great if you love a good shoot 'em up.</p>
<p>This reimagining of the cult classic arcade shooter Platypus takes everything that was great about the original game and updates it with a huge host of new features for the definitive edition of Platypus. Led by the original creator, Anthony Flack, along with a new team it's not just a simple remaster. They've completely revamped it from scratch with new models and artwork, updated gameplay and new content.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w34Y8oSRqIY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e746f3c1347376d93d7cdb1108d92a2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w34Y8oSRqIY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"As the industry has shifted towards more complex, feature-rich, lengthier games, we wanted to go in the other direction: providing a one-button shmup that’s fun from the moment you pick it up!" said Anthony Flack, Lead Games Designer at Claymatic Games. "You don’t need to learn any complicated combos or absorb a bookish tutorial teaching how you can have fun later. Instead, you get right to the action. Platypus Reclayed is designed to be something you pick up for 20 minutes before bed or on your lunch break, but you enjoy every second of it!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two-Player Simultaneous Action: Team up with a friend for double the fun!</li>
<li>Stunning Clay-Animated Graphics: Experience the beauty of clay-animation like never before with all-new high definition artwork.</li>
<li>Addictive, Exciting Gameplay: Get ready for heart-pounding action that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</li>
<li>The original <em>Platypus</em> soundtrack is back with even more officially licensed remixes of classic 1980s game tunes from our friends at C64audio.</li>
<li>Adjustable Difficulty Settings: Whether you're a novice or a seasoned pro, <em>Platypus</em> has a challenge for everyone.</li>
<li>Perfect for the Entire Family: Share the joy of <em>Platypus</em> with loved ones of all ages!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Inspired by classics like UFO: Enemy Unknown / XCOM - Archrebel Tactics gets MicroProse backing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Archrebel Tactics looks awesome if you're into challenging sci-fi strategy games, and now it has MicroProse backing it as publisher. Covered first <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/archrebel-tactics-is-a-wild-sci-fi-turn-based-strategy-game-inspired-by-rebelstar-and-x-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in June of 2024</a>, it still has an early demo up on the itch page which has a Linux version. It's not clear if it will continue the Native Linux version for the full Steam release, but will likely run with Proton if not.</p>
<p>It's a retro-inspired, turn-based sci-fi strategy game set on the dangerous colony world of Kaprical. Drawing direct inspiration from legendary classics like Rebelstar (1986) and UFO: Enemy Unknown, Archrebel Tactics brings back grid-based, action-point-limited warfare with modern design twists and layered campaign choices. In the game you rally a resistance force to combat a secretive totalitarian faction that has seized control of the colonies. Through tactical battles, strategic decision-making, and encounters with alien wildlife, players will shape the fate of the planet — or perish trying.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z2H1liSbVTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/229039085445f8b0918f0400a436130f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z2H1liSbVTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned how progress has been steadily ongoing since 2021 when they quit their job to work full time on it, but "after three years of intense work, my funds were nearly depleted, and a few ill-timed real-life events forced me to scale back to part-time development". Thankfully, MicroProse are financially backing it as publisher now so work continues towards release.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic Turn-Based Combat – Grid-based battles with an action-point system inspired by Laser Squad and early X-COM, featuring expanded functionality such as multi-selection.</li>
<li>Travel Mode Mechanics – The classic action-point system is enhanced with a travel mode that lets units cover large portions of terrain in a single turn, greatly improving the pace on larger maps.</li>
<li>Player-Driven Campaign – Choose your mission order, face persistent consequences, and experience branching outcomes. Align with one of three factions to gain their unique benefits.</li>
<li>Unit Customization &amp; Progression – Expand your squad into a platoon, recruit new units, and construct, build, or even capture droids to fight at your side. Unlock and upgrade gear, and plan the class type and progression for each human unit.</li>
<li>Partially Procedural Missions – No two battles are the same. Includes a standalone mission generator and a mission editor for endless replay value.</li>
<li>Emphasis on Environment Destructibility – While enemy compounds have indestructible walls, the terrain itself is largely destructible. Use this to your advantage.</li>
<li>Alien Threats – Deal with both hostile factions and the feral wildlife of Kaprical, including massive native behemoths and something else that has descended upon the colony.</li>
<li>Retro Aesthetic, Modern Systems – Pixel-art visuals enhanced by bone-based animation, particles, and shaders.</li>
</ul>

      <title>With a flooded world, survival-crafting sim Oceaneers is getting a proper demo September 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oceaneers is definitely one of the games I'm most excited to see, with it's interesting take on survival and colony building across a flooded world. Thankfully we'll all get a chance to properly try it early, as they've revealed today that a proper demo is coming on September 25th.</p>
<p>With a flooded world you have to survive, build and scavenge across unstable islands. Build your colony, scavenge debris, craft equipment, and train your survivors. Construct a raft and fend off sharks as you explore island bunkers and uncover lost Float-Tech from an old-world corporation. Island life is not all sunshine and coconuts. With sparse resources and limited island space, planning will be essential as you construct workstations, manage food production and secure drinkable water—all while making sure your island refuge stays above water. I'm getting definite Don't Starve vibes from this one.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ykuHNa_xcw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b43b52f2c91db01dcdda4aecd1cffc02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ykuHNa_xcw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I expect it will work great with Valve's Proton on Linux systems. Maybe not the Steam Deck though, as they don't currently have controller support plans just yet. <em>Something I think they're pretty crazy to be skipping over.</em></p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Control multiple characters in this single player experience.</li>
<li>Design multiple rafts and send survivors on expeditions.</li>
<li>Haul islands back to your colony to expand your island home.</li>
<li>Improve island buoyancy with contraptions that keep islands afloat.</li>
<li>Research and unlock advanced workstations and upgrades.</li>
<li>Survive against weather events, and threats on both land and sea.</li>
<li>Farm crops, prepare rations and cook meals.</li>
<li>Customize your survivor names, traits, hair styles... including beards &amp; mustaches!</li>
<li>Uncover the deep sea storyline plot alongside the survival journey.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Some game developers are far too shameless about generative AI use</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm having to be steadily more careful on what I choose to cover here on GamingOnLinux, with more games releasing using generative AI.</p>
<p>To start things off to be clear — my current stance is generally to ignore games that use generative AI. My whole point is to support creative people, <em>not</em> machines. It's quickly getting more difficult because some won't disclose it at all (even though they're supposed to), it's steadily being used by more studios for all sorts of things big and small, and the AI notice on Steam is buried at the bottom of pages and sometimes I do forget to check <em>before</em> getting into a game and end up <em>wasting</em> my time when I see it later.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the latest, where the developers are just so completely brazen on how they're using generative AI. It's called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824790/GUG/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GUG</a> and the thing is, the idea of the game sounds really cool, but their full statement on their generative AI use really rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16438033921755169890gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16438033921755169890gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GUG is a sandbox simulation roguelike where you generate monsters—”gugs”—by typing any word or phrase. Your choice of words determines how they look, behave and battle. Type “banana flamethrower” and you might get a spiky yellow pyromaniac. Type “emotional support gremlin” and get… Well, who really knows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds cool right? Then you see the Steam page AI notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p>
<p>This game relies on AI to underpin its procedural image and functionality generation systems (the systems that allow for personalised creatures and their effects).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked a bit deeper, and found their <a href="https://martianlawyersclub.notion.site/GUG-FAQ-170d2f4bb4f780bd8a66d08ca00f63c1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full FAQ</a> which they've linked in a Steam community post. This is where it just really irked me. Have a little read of the full quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does GUG use ethical AI? What is the company’s stance on AI ethics?<br/>
<br/>
As a company, we are frank and open about our usage of AI. To put it simply: <strong>we use language models and image models that are trained on content from the internet that’s been extracted without consideration for its copyright or licensing</strong>. Models of this size are huge for a reason. They must be able to store enormous amounts of information on the internet. When you type in “clam” or “bucket of milk” or “martian lawyers club” or “henry kissinger” you have a gug that (likely) incorporates content from that prompt — we can rely on the model’s vast understanding of content to help it synthesize knowledge into a usable format to inject into the game. The *same* is true of our image generation model. Our image model is fine-tuned on a collection of our own images. This allows the image model to faithfully utilize the game’s intended art direction, while incorporating the domain knowledge of the user’s request.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the game is running on contentious technology. It is also important to understand that at the current state of knowledge in machine learning is impossible to achieve the flexibility of the gug generation system in any other way. Anyone who claims that you can “train” your own model from scratch solely on your own data is either misinformed, is conflating the concepts of “training” and “finetuning”, or has enormous amounts of cash and time.</p>
<p>Of course we want to emphasize: as active members of the machine learning community and longtime video game developers, we are internally working on alternatives and planning to move ourselves further and further from unethical and unfair uses of AI. For example, there are open-source projects trying to replicate the capabilities of current models, while using fair-licensed datasets. We believe that what we have built is interesting and fun enough to our players and represents a valid use of this technology in its nascent state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis in the above quote mine.</em></p>
<p>With that in mind then, they're fully aware that the generative AI models they're using are trained on others work, scraped from all corners of the internet. It's made their game GUG "interesting and fun enough" right now that who cares right? Why put in the hard work to make your own stuff when the <em>totally intelligent machines</em> can do it for you?</p>
<p>When we have <strong>100s</strong> of games releasing on Steam <em>constantly</em> - why am I going to pick one where the developers aren't even doing a lot of the work? From artwork to story text - why am I going to play or read it if it's just made by a machine, what's the point? The answer is — I'm not. I'm going to continue clicking ignore on them. And I hope to be able to stick by that stance for a long time.</p>
<p>Looking over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20Content%20Disclosed" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there's now over <strong>10,000</strong> games with an AI disclosure notice. Of that number, 3,957 have a 2025 release date. It's only going to keep increasing.</p>
<p>I suppose it's yet another good thing about GamingOnLinux remaining 100% independent, I don't <em>have</em> to cover anything. And at times I can just write an article like this, pointing out how the industry is just changing and throwing some thoughts up on it. I don't like where this is going, but automation is inevitable in everything isn't it? Higher ups always want to maximise everything and some people are just lazy. What bugs me the most though, is that the more you rely on AI generation - the less you learn and improve.</p>

      <title>Long-awaited prehistoric multiplayer platformer Dino Run 2 is heading back to Kickstarter with a new demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some setbacks, Pixeljam are readying a fresh Kickstarter to help fund the prehistoric multiplayer racing platformer Dino Run 2, along with a fresh demo.</p>
<p>Dino Run 2 lets players race against extinction in a pixelated world of danger and charm — escaping an apocalyptic wall of doom, selecting from a cast of uniquely specialized dinos, and customizing every scale and claw with a vast library of visual mods.</p>
<p>This is not the first time they've crowdfunded for the game, which has a bit of a troubled history. Their first big Kickstarter failed in 2013, their second in 2018 was a <em>lot</em> smaller to focus on getting more work on it done which did succeed. But after that, things fell off a bit.</p>
<p>In an email they told me how it ended up in "development hell" but in 2022 they started the project over with a new team, rebuilding the foundations and now it's ready to expand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1648887781755168756gol1.gif" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1648887781755168756gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>With the new campaign launching September 2nd, they're hoping for enough funds to get it out in Early Access. They already have plenty to show for it now with a fully playable multiplayer sandbox, which they said has "custom netcode that requires no servers and will last for decades, this sandbox includes worldbuilding tools, online and LAN multiplayer, and early access to the systems that will power the full game".</p>
<p>Since it requires no servers they told me "I suppose we accidentally supported the "stop killing games" movement, but it was never our original intention - we just didn't want the multiplayer experience to ever suddenly go away like Dino Run 1 did".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/the-dino-run-2-early-access-campaign" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Early Access Kickstarter</a> will go live on September 2nd, with full Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>I'm a big fan of one of their more recent releases with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/utopia-must-fall-is-easily-one-of-the-best-modern-arcade-shoot-em-ups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Utopia Must Fall</a>, so hopefully this goes well.</em></p>

      <title>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted announced for release in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A PlayStation classic returns. The shoot 'em up R-Type Delta: HD Boosted was announced with a PC release coming in November.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1998 for the PlayStation 1, this new version of the game will have various enhancements for modern platforms. Plus it will no doubt work just fine on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck thanks to Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hZL-B5KD1jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53fe2b5991b8ebc71284f136c386f936.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hZL-B5KD1jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm just happy we're seeing so many more retro games get spruced up for modern audiences, making them feel better and easy to access.</p>
<p>Updated to run at a smooth 60 FPS and with the option to dynamically switch between the original graphics and HD visuals at the start of each gaming session, R-Type Delta HD Boosted features numerous options and new additions catering to modern gamers. The much-loved soundtrack has received a refresh,with newly-arranged compositions from Masahiko Ishida (R-Type II), as well as USP (R-Type Delta) and Chris Hülsbeck (R-Type for C64 and Amiga). There is also an option to adjust the screen size,  and multiple difficult settings alongside an all-new practice mode provide players the opportunity to hone their skills before facing down the Bydo Empire for real.</p>

      <title>Rogue-lite slot machine nightmare CloverPit launches September 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The demonic lovechild of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, apparently. CloverPit looks like it will suck away all your time.</p>
<p>It's been something of a viral hit too with the demo helping it along, as it's gathered nearly half a million Steam wishlists which puts it in the top 100 upcoming games. Today, they revealed it will be launching September 3rd. Going by the demo, it should be a flawless experience on Linux systems thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>While the game is inspired by actual slot-machine gambling, the developer was keen to note it's "not a slot machine simulator" as it's "designed to be broken and ultimately overcome". They said they "don’t really like gambling" which is what the game is about as you manipulate it for extra coins, while you bend and break the rules.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A gripping rogue-lite where every round could be your last!</li>
<li>Meta-progression, seeded runs, unlockable run modifiers and power-ups!</li>
<li>A hellish escape room atmosphere!</li>
<li>150+ items and synergies to boost your luck!</li>
<li>A sinister tale of addiction and escape!</li>

      <title>Super Farming Boy is a bizarre farming sim about chain reactions with a Cuphead inspired style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've never played a farming sim like this before. Blending a few genres together where Stardew Valley collides with a Cuphead like style. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I'm really struggling to give you a good explainer on this one. It has incredibly simple controls, since it was designed for mobile as well as desktop — but don't let that put you off. It's very accessible and the weird mixture it offers is something rather different.</p>
<p>The story goes that you control the character Super, whose mother and friends have been captured by the evil KORPO, who then hires you to work your own farmland so you can earn everything and everyone back. KORPO even sends you mail about how slow you are. Bit rude huh? So you have to go through lots of challenges to make money each day, to keep progressing through upgrades to make earning monies easier and keep unlocking more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1265784811755100499gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1265784811755100499gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the farming side of it, Super Farming Boy is all about initiating silly chain reactions. When you pull a crop that's ready, it will interact with tiles around it to cause chain reactions and combos so it's not just a case of planting, watering and waiting. You need to figure out all the combinations that work together, to maximise how much you earn. Some crops are also massive, and need these chain reactions to hit them to bring down their HP to harvest them. Pretty fun when you get going! The higher the combo, the more monies you get.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19202309401755098778gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19202309401755098778gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I also had to laugh the first time I saw the special Fever Time mode after you've done a few combos to build up your super meter, which activates a wild mode (pictured above) where crops around you grow instantly. The whole game is just thoroughly <em>bizarre</em> like this all the way through. I love it though, when we have so many Stardew Valley-likes, this is breaking through the dirt to find a little gold.</p>
<p>You can also buy a few critters to help you do various things around the farm. Everything is pricey as heck though, that KORPO really makes you sweat for it. Thankfully, once you learn a few combos from pulling various crops, you'll soon be earning lots of monies quite easily.</p>
<p>In a way it's pretty streamlined since you don't need to worry about inventory management, allowing you to just sit back and relax a little more while you build up your farm to make some awesome reactions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rkOTEkRKxCs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e5031880112ddf0fadaa8abc5b3fbd5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rkOTEkRKxCs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Cuphead style to it is pretty clear, which actually looks quite nice without being too derivative. It has its own unique charm to it thanks to the setting and all the quirky characters.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so no formal review type-thing from me yet, other than just summing up that it has a really great idea and I'm excitedly looking forward to them finishing it with all the extra content they have planned. Like boss fights (yep, in a farming game), new seasons, more missions and the list goes on. It continues to scratch a very weird itch in my brain I didn't know I needed.</p>
<p>Works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4, and they made numerous tweaks to have it run nicely on Steam Deck directly too.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows gets bumped up back to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve seem confident enough in how Assassin’s Creed Shadows runs on Steam Deck, that it's now again Steam Deck Verified. It's nice that Valve do actually go back and recheck titles more than once, hopefully they will do this for other titles too.</p>
<p>When it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-out-now-steam-deck-verified-but-has-nvidia-problems-on-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally released</a>, it was Steam Deck Verified but Valve dropped it down to a Playable rating on July 24th noting it had issues with small text. As of August 12th it's now fully Verified again, with a note now actually there to say it does require internet for setup and they're recommending <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/proton-10-0-2-beta-brings-even-more-gaming-improvements-to-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a> which is set as the default. It's also showing as SteamOS Compatible.</p>

<p>We've seen the ratings switch on a few other titles before like Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/marvels-spider-man-2-has-lost-its-steam-deck-verified-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">losing the Verified rating</a> and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/marvels-spider-man-2-now-steam-deck-verified-with-a-fresh-update-out-to-improve-performance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gaining it back again</a>. And we just saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-gets-steam-deck-verified-with-the-enhanced-update-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II also get bumped up to Verified</a>.</p>
<p>The main issue I find with the Verified rating on these bigger titles is that while the games do work, and you can usually hit at least 30FPS, there's a fair amount of visual compromises to make it happen. At least in the case of Assassin's Creed Shadows, it still looks visually quite good on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Valve confirm that Steam purchases with PayPal have been limited to a few select currencies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the ongoing saga of payment processors locking down payments, Steam has been hit by PayPal limiting purchases to only a select few currencies.</p>
<p>This has been going on for a little while now, with numerous posts across social media from users wondering why PayPal has been unavailable for them. Recently though, it seems the situation has only worsened as Valve have now put up a statement to clarify the situation when going to check out in a whole bunch of countries.</p>
<p>Valve have now added a statement to their <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">purchasing FAQ</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PayPal use on Steam is currently unavailable in my currency. Why?</strong></p>
<p>In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies <em>other than</em> EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.</p>
<p>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/78E3-7431-1E88-AD59" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Wallet code</a> to add funds to your account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't entirely know why this is happening though. It may be linked to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other payment issues</a> that Steam and itch.io have been facing but it also might not be.</p>

      <title>After the DMCA takedown debacle, Old School Rally has now replaced all affected car models</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was unfortunate what happened with Old School Rally when it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-restores-the-steam-page-for-old-school-rally-after-it-got-hit-with-a-dmca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit with a DMCA takedown</a>, but thankfully the situation is solved now.</p>
<p>It's a reminder to game developers that if you're going to use assets from somewhere, you might not actually be getting the real rights to them — unfortunately.</p>
<p>The developer has announced that all 13 models of cars in the game that were affected by this issue have been replaced, with shiny new retro-looking models that perfectly fit in with the game. That's quite a bit of work for a smaller developer to get sorted in a short time and the models look great in-game.</p>
<p>Hopefully this hasn't derailed their previous plan to have the game finished and out of Early Access by the end of the year.</p>

      <title>Go on the hunt for a simple pilsner in a world full of craft beer in Dude, Where Is My Beer? A New Hop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a world overrun by craft beer enthusiasts and their endless creative brews, one grumpy guy is still on a quest to find one thing: a regular, basic pilsner. Dude, Where Is My Beer? A New Hop is a sequel to Dude, Where Is My Beer? from 2020.</p>
<p>More about it: "An evil Master Brewer has banned pilsner and is hunting down all who dare to drink it. But our mustachioed hero has a plan: enter a brewing contest to bring it back. Along the way, he’ll need to gather brewing ingredients, find the right equipment, and even team up with the rebels in “The Pilsner Front.” Can you defeat the IPA regime and bring pilsner to the world once again?</p>
<p>A New Hop sees the return of the much-loved nostalgic point-and-click gameplay, gorgeous comic stylings, charming sense of humour, and of course the warm embrace of an imminent bar crawl through Oslo’s streets to defeat an evil brewer of beverages that are NOT pilsners. Are you up for a legendary night out in Norway?"</p>
<p>The announcement came with the launch of a demo you can try right now on Steam. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights (from the press email):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>30 unique pilsner-lacking locations to explore.</li>
<li>Puzzles to solve using old-school 90s interfaces.</li>
<li>The Beer-o-meter tracks your tipsy choices.</li>
<li>The distinctly numb feeling of not finding a pilsner.</li>
<li>This guy really wants a pilsner, huh?</li>
<li>But there aren’t any, because of the Master Brewer sitch.</li>
<li>Can we please just get this dude a pilsner.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Nexus Mods app 0.15.2 brings updater improvements and more bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team just put out a new version of their in-development cross-platform mod manager, the Nexus Mods app v0.15.2 is now available to test.</p>
<p>Eventually this will replace Vortex, but there's a lot of work ahead. It currently fully supports Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077 with work ongoing to properly support Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord. <em>Many more games to come.</em></p>
<p>With this update they've improved updating mods to make it "faster and more predictable" so it will correctly replace the old mod in all loadouts. Searching is now available in more places across the UI, mod collections you export will now include the game version number and they've reduced the app startup time.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-12 hotfix adds a few more needed tweaks for video playback</title>

      <title>NVIDIA 580.76.05 released for Linux as the new recommended stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first proper release of the NVIDIA 580 driver series is out now, with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/252790/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA 580.76.05</a> now the latest recommended driver.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/nvidia-driver-570-181-released-for-linux-as-the-latest-recommended-stable-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bumped up NVIDIA driver 570.181</a> as the recommended driver less than a week ago, which contained the vague "Minor bug fixes and improvements", so I'm still sort-of expecting more driver security issues to be revealed soon. Unless they really did need to bump up the previous driver for something so minor they didn't even say what…</p>
<p>Anyway, here's all the changes for the new driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlights since R580 Beta Release, 580.65.06</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated egl-x11 to version 1.0.3.</li>
<li>Updated egl-wayland to version 1.1.20.</li>
<li>Added an "OutputBitsPerComponent" MetaMode attribute that can be used to control the number of bits per color component transmitted via a display connector. If not specified, the driver will choose an optimal color format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights from R580 Beta Release, 580.65.06</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Vulkan applications to hang when destroying swapchains after a lost device event.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could allow atomic commit and other DRM operations to return success status despite having failed due to handling an interrupt:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause GTK 4 applications to crash when using the Vulkan backend on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could intermittently cause llama.cpp to crash on exit when using the Vulkan backend:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528</a></li>
<li>Added support for the fifo-v1 Wayland protocol on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Updated GPU clock value reporting in nvidia-settings, NVML, and nvidia-smi to show clocks before thermal and idle slowdowns for better consistency with the equivalent functionality on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with Bigscreen Beyond Head Mounted Displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in a black screen when setting specific modes on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused blank or frozen screens under the following conditions: nvidia-drm is loaded with the modeset=1 and fbdev=1 parameters, using a Maxwell or Pascal series GPU, and more than one display device of differing resolutions are connected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-suspend.service to fail when available system memory is low.</li>
<li>Enabled RMIntrLockingMode by default. This feature can help reduce stutter especially when using virtual reality. This feature was originally introduced in the r570 series. It can be disabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=0` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Implemented another feature that can reduce time spent in the interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts by deferring the work until later. This feature is experimental and disabled by default. This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>

<p>POSTAL 2 Redux is now on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> with the developers gathering funding to make this enhanced Unity rebuild of the classic divisive game.</p>
<p>Originally launched in 2003, this will bring the game over from ancient Unreal Engine to Unity and make it work better on modern platforms. Plus, plenty of enhancements to the visuals and basically overhauling everything while keeping the spirit of it intact.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8851136341755014819gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What's new in Redux:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A modern backbone. We’re hauling POSTAL 2 into Unity so it runs perfectly on modern hardware. This gives us the ability to have completely scalable requirements. Basically, for every platform this comes to it will look as good as it can for the hardware. </li>
<li>Loading Zones, begone! Paradise streams in as you walk. No more load screens. Just roam and ruin.</li>
<li>A complete graphical upgrade. Higher‑resolution textures, upgraded shaders and materials and lighting make every billboard, back alley, and biohazard pop.</li>
<li>Guns with bite. Balancing the combat based on community feedback. Weapons are being rebuilt to hit harder, punch through flesh, and send bodies flopping with proper ragdolls. You’ll feel the boom.</li>
<li>Check out my insides. Shipping malls, restaurants, offices, arcades—stuffed with destructible props. Let loose and see the World explode in front of your eyes. </li>
<li>Crowds that find trouble faster. Civilians still snitch and cops still overreact, but smarter pathing means they get to the chaos quicker and make it messier when they do.</li>
<li>Champ gets promoted from mascot to menace. Pet him, point him, weaponize him. Man’s best friend finally acts like it.</li>
<li>Built to break out of the PC cage. Targeting PC and modern consoles so Paradise can spread its disease broadly and legally. </li>
<li>Quality of life, everywhere. Widescreen done right, modern inputs, fewer crashes, smarter UI—the boring necessities so the fun stuff can be loud.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for why Kickstarter? Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twenty years later, POSTAL 2 is still selling, still memed, but confined by limited platform support and its older engine. Console players want it. Mac players can’t even launch it. Doing it right (new engine, modern pipelines, rebuilt assets, smarter systems) and also expanding the Universe and continuing the story of POSTAL 2 costs real money. To that end we need to gauge the community interest in this happening. If the interest is there we also want to engage with the community upfront, rather than turn up with something in 12 months and hope it's what people want. POSTAL 2 has always been a journey, we want to bring you along on the next phase of this adventure. <br/>
Kickstarter lets us do that without some suit leaning over the keyboard asking us to “tone it down.” No creative half‑measures. We answer only to Running With Scissors and you. POSTAL 2 Redux is for the fans. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kickstarter is asking for $250,000 to make it a reality and there's special stretch goals to expand the game further if they pull in lots of funding. Extras like time of day effects, a sandbox mode and more.</p>

<p>"We are absolutely thrilled to launch the POSTAL 2 Redux Kickstarter campaign today," said Eric Masher, COO, Impact Inked. "The original game is one of the most exciting and important games of the 21st century, and we’re honored to work with Team Beef and Running With Scissors to bring the POSTAL Dude, Paradise, and everything that makes POSTAL 2 special to today’s gamers!"</p>
<p>The campaign runs through September 12.</p>

      <title>Rising Heat aims to be a next evolution of horde survival twin-stick shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sprinkle of Geometry Wars and other twin-stick shooters, a dash of Vampire Survivors styled upgrades - Rising Heat thinks it's going to be special.</p>
<p>So special in fact the developers claim it's going to be the "next evolution of horde survival". That's…a pretty bold claim huh? One I thought I should check out as part of my ongoing quest to play everything resembling some sort of survivor-like game. <em>I'm a sucker for quick action, lots of upgrades and watching numbers go up.</em></p>
<p>Here you're flying a ship with floaty physics that you need to take into account. It's very much a twin-stick shooter, or should I say twin-stick <em>smasher</em>, as a big part of it is the <em>tackling</em> system. Yeah you have weapons you can fire, but your ship is directly a weapon too. You will dash repeatedly into enemies to cause all sorts of chaotic explosions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3641959181755012652gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3641959181755012652gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The upgrade system is pretty interesting too in its design. You buy and attach modules to your ship when you level up from the shop, and you're able to fuse together two of these modules to make them more powerful (and save on your limited active slots) to reign down more destruction. The fusing system is essential as a lot of modules have debuffs as well as buffs, with fusing reducing the debuffs. The first fusion attempt is free, so it's always worth doing and you can re-fuse to re-roll at a cost as many times as you want for each module fusion until you get what you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14418868401755012071gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14418868401755012071gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18548151581755012069gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18548151581755012069gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's an <em>integration</em> system for these modules. You only have 5 active slots to place modules in, but you have a bunch of additional integration slots,where you can pay up to make modules available for use outside of your active slots. It can be a little bit of information overload but it's all pretty simple once you get going.</p>
<p>Lots of stats to think about too so it will take a while to go through and figure out what sort of build you want to make, but that's part of the allure of it. All the modules, stats and the action together make it really interesting. I'm not sure if it's anything close to the evolution they're marketing it as — but the modules system is quite fun to play with.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MAItG038CE8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bad03d4db2525dd5eab2fa83c5d6d3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MAItG038CE8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The co-op mode is part of what's going to make this one rock. You each have a ship on the field, linked together by any energy beam and it can end up pretty crazy thanks to this system. Possibly one of the best co-op experiences in a survivor-like game so far.</p>
<p>With different ships, pilots, hacks and maps to unlock through the full game, I am most definitely excited for more.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic movement</strong><strong>:</strong> Master a dynamic momentum-based movement system. Line up multiple enemies to execute a flurry of precise tackles, dealing devastating damage while bouncing between a barrage of enemy bullets!</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Loadout:</strong> Each cockpit has a limited inventory in which the pilot can upgrade, integrate, and fuse hacks together to create varied builds. Different strategies in the shop, hack positioning, action order, and even negative stats will help get the most out of every build.</li>
<li><strong>Plan of Attack:</strong> A strong pilot must plan out their runs, including which pilot, ship, hacks, and weapons to equip. As the aliens learn to adapt, how does a successful pilot stay one step ahead?</li>
<li><strong>Fly With a Friend:</strong> In co-op mode, two pilots are linked by a supercharged beam, creating opportunities for mass destruction…assuming they’ve got each other’s backs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love arcade-styled action, twin-stick shooting and arena-styled shooters then I think Rising Heat has a lot of neat ideas bundled together. The demo is worth checking out right now and the game works perfectly on Linux with Proton 9.0-4 tested.</p>

      <title>Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade II gets Steam Deck Verified with the Enhanced Update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Enhanced Update has arrived for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, bringing with it optimisations, Steam Deck Verified support and more.</p>
<p>Originally released on PC back in May 2024, this update adds a new "Very High" graphics preset. They said that their team "carefully considered where we could make the most impactful improvements for a visual quality bump at a reasonable performance cost" for it, rather than just dialling everything up. They've also added in NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>A good update for Steam Deck players too as they explained in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/528728489311864054" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something else we wanted to revisit with this update was performance on Steam Deck to achieve Verified compatibility, and we’re pleased to report that this work was successful. Deck performance at launch wasn’t an out-of-the-box experience, so players would find themselves needing to tweak settings to achieve optimal performance. We’ve now made the game ‘Deck-aware’, so the game will now automatically select the best settings for this hardware. We’ve also found some CPU performance improvements for a better game experience on Steam Deck.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">The full list of changes are below:</p>

      <title>Repterra is a base-building survival RTS set in a world overrun by dinosaurs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Repterra is a promising upcoming real-time strategy game that has a demo available, and if you love the idea of facing hordes of dinosaurs it's one for you.</p>
<p>Set in a similar gameplay style to the likes of They Are Billions and Age of Darkness, with you building and expanding while also dealing with hordes that will come to try and destroy you in waves. So it's a bit of a mixture of classic RTS building with some tower defense. The demo as tested worked perfectly on Linux with Proton 9.0-4 and it's going to be worth keeping an eye on, as it's exactly the type of RTS I love to see more of.</p>
<p>You're not just building up walls to hide behind though, you'll also be building up your own little army of humans and dinos together - some dinos can even have a human jump on their back to unlock special extras. I just think it's neat to see.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZtRdtdK4B8A?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ecb9f0799465d1a1e630372bec22cf06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZtRdtdK4B8A?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A little rough around the edges since it's a demo of an unfinished game, but it shows a lot of promise that reminds me of the good classic RTS games I played endless hours of in my youth. Looking forward to seeing more of it but there's no release date being mentioned for the full game just yet.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique Breeding, Riding, and Taming mechanics.</li>
<li>5 Different factions with unique play-style focuses.</li>
<li>Game modifying perks that can be chosen at load-out.</li>
<li>Permanent unlockable points and shop (levels, perks, bonus features).</li>
<li>Customizable hero units..</li>
<li>Campaign mode.</li>
<li>Extensive Survival mode with unlockables and meta progression.</li>
<li>100,000+ dinos running at a smooth 60fps.</li>
<li>Dozens of different units, dinos, and buildings.</li>
<li>Achievements and Steam Cloud.</li>
<li>4k High rez graphic in a timeless pre-rendered style.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Use bombs creatively to progress in the puzzle-platformer metroidvania Öoo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Öoo is a visually charming and clever puzzle-platformer metroidvania where you make creative use of bombs to move yourself around to progress. The game works great on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>You don't directly have any real abilities and so you need to stick bombs everywhere and see what happens. Bombs can push you across gaps, send you flying to hit other platforms and bombs can push other bombs to annihilate things blocking your path. Some might even show up hidden passageways to allow you to progress further.</p>
<p>A game that does a lot with a little and it's absolutely worth picking up for a couple of hours of fun. Some areas need just a little bit of your imagination but none of it is particularly difficult to figure out, so it won't waste you time making you scratch your brain for ages.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A dense experience that can be enjoyed in just 2–3 hours.</li>
<li>A cute yet oddly mysterious world.</li>
<li>Diverse puzzle solutions that change depending on how you use bombs.</li>
<li>No text — enjoy the game without language barriers.</li>
<li>Cute enough to delight even those who don’t like bugs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Webcam-based 6DoF head &amp; eye tracking app LookPilot released on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LookPilot is an app that provides head and eye tracking for games, using nothing but your webcam and it looks pretty slick with a new Steam release. It even has Linux support right out of the box and there's a demo available to see if it works for you before buying it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hs-8CzalGIk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62471e9f7661bab3efc09bc07cf003c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hs-8CzalGIk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6DoF Tracking: Head yaw, pitch, roll, plus forward/back, left/right, up/down translation.</li>
<li>Head + Eye Blend: Combine head and eye rotation with adjustable influence to match your preference.</li>
<li>High-Rate Output: Responsive output at high refresh rates for smooth camera control—even from low-FPS webcams.</li>
<li>Quick Start: Install → Start tracking → Launch the game. Most titles work instantly; some need a one-time in-game toggle.</li>
<li>Low Overhead: Runs on CPU—no dedicated hardware or GPU required.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform: Windows and Linux support, including titles launched through Wine.</li>
<li>Wide Compatibility: Works with 700+ games via standard head-tracking interfaces.</li>
<li>Keybinds: Recenter, toggle tracking, and switch presets on the fly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's on the newer side, there's not many guides for games up on this yet, and especially so for the Linux side with most guides missing - but nice to see it release to give Linux gamers more options like it.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3326890/LookPilot/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Smash everything with your balls in BALL x PIT releasing October 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you have the balls to go deep into a bottomless pit? Well, you'll find out on October 15 when fast-paced fantasy roguelite BALL x PIT releases.</p>
<p>BALL x PIT is one of my favourites that I played during the last Steam Next Fest, with it's delicious fast-paced combat that sort-of blends together Arkanoid / Breakout with Vampire Survivor like elements into something truly weird and challenging. Add to that the mini city-building aspect to it and there's a lot to like about it and I can't wait to play more of it. I certainly wasn't alone in loving it, as it was actually the 12th most-played demo from the entire Steam Next Fest event in June.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GB5v8BAn97Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de2b2d8eeff2b371c717f516f5accc01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GB5v8BAn97Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fuse Your Balls</strong></p>
<p>The Ball Fusion system encourages explosive experimentation with over 60 randomized balls to equip and combine during your journey. Discover overpowered combinations and unexpected synergies from hundreds of possible outcomes. Load up, lean in, and let the spit hit the fan! </p>
<p><strong>Build New Ballbylon</strong></p>
<p>Expand New Ballbylon with over 70 unique buildings that provide gameplay bonuses and unlock further power-ups, new characters, and more! As your community grows, task homebound heroes with automated tasks to keep the resources coming while you dive deeper into the pit. </p>
<p><strong>Discover New Realms</strong></p>
<p>Face legions of diverse enemies within the pit, battling through barren deserts, frozen caverns, savage forests and more. Each region offers its own unique set of hazards on top of hordes of increasingly challenging foes and mighty, screen-filling bosses. </p>
<p><strong>Recruit Fellow Hunters</strong></p>
<p>As you explore the pit you’ll encounter fellow treasure hunters eager to add their skills to your expedition. Each character has unique, upgradable mechanics that totally change the way you play the game. Experimentation and adaptation are crucial to the success of New Ballbylon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo, which is still live, works perfectly with Proton 9.0-4 on Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Change the world around you with unique spells in the colourful puzzle game Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a spell system that somewhat reminded me a little of the amazing Baba Is You for how you change the world to win, the upcoming Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times looks damn fun.</p>
<p>With a semi-open world design you get to freely roam around, with the only limit being the current spell combinations available to you. You'll come across lots of different obstacles including blocked paths, hazards, movable objects and more that you'll overcome by unlocking different spells. What makes it really interesting (aside from the incredibly vibrant style) is the spell system itself. You get up to 40 different runes, and then craft unique spells by mixing keywords together. They said there's "over 102 million permutations in total" and so lots of ways to beat the open-ended puzzles.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6jEmPHQlOwE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa311212e47a5db1ee515e4a22d34472.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6jEmPHQlOwE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re excited to introduce Rhell, a fun puzzle adventure that encourages players to experiment, inspires creativity, and offers a fresh take on the puzzle genre,” said Simon Byron, Managing Director, Yogscast Games. “Alongside the depth of storytelling and puzzle-solving, players will feel drawn to Rhell's emotional development as she goes in search of answers and restores normality to the toon-like world.”</p>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now and it works perfectly with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>You absolutely have to try the expanded demo of Moonsigil Atlas</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas is easily one of the most unique deck-builders around, and the latest major update to the demo has me hooked. You have to try it.</p>
<p>A game we've covered here at GamingOnLinux a few times because it's just so cool. Deck-building where you don't fuss around with an energy system, or limited action points. Instead, you play your cards down in a physical space, with each having their own shape that you need to fit onto the board. Even if deck-building isn't usually your thing, if you love strategy and puzzle games you might even find this win you over.</p>
<p>This twist on having to position your cards, along with the enemies messing with the board too, just adds such a fun dynamic to the genre that I can't help but keep coming back to the demo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8iscwsdG4tc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/478b7218f0370226669c8edc6516b8c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8iscwsdG4tc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just some of what's been added to the fresh demo update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipse levels</strong> for additional difficulty modifiers once you've beaten the demo.</li>
<li><strong>New encounters</strong>, including Astral Card Packs and new forms of infusing.</li>
<li><strong>Improved visuals</strong> for the player character and encounters.</li>
<li><strong>Even more</strong>, including starting boons, character mastery, run history, Astral Dust, new cards, and a lot of small quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get a surprising amount of hours out of the demo with all of this.</p>
<p>I will be amazed if this isn't a big hit when it's released. It has Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Dark fairy-tale metroidvania Well Dweller looks incredible, probably a must-have for Hollow Knight fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dark fairy-tale metroidvania Well Dweller is the next game from Kyle Thompson who also made the highly rated Crypt Custodian and Islets. Kyle is continuing to team up with Top Hat Studios, Inc. for publishing too.</p>
<p>Here you play as Glimmer, a tiny bird armed with a matchstick who must burn the wicked queen to save his family before they become part of her royal gown. It was revealed during the recent Nintendo event but it will be releasing for Windows as well, so Linux / Steam Deck fans can play it with Proton.</p>
<p>The artwork on the monsters is what really pulled me into this one, those are some seriously freakish looking creations. Looks like the boss fights will be quite intense in this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J1e29j2DzqU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/231257477d7e801dc1a9529f1700770e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J1e29j2DzqU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venture forth into a whimsical but morbid fairy-tale landscape, and battle terrifying beasts whilst gaining new abilities to expand your world. Discover secrets, mysteries, and the riddles that rot in the underbelly of this wretched queendom.</p>
<p>The dark nooks and crannies throughout shelter powerful trinkets that are key to survival, and a cast of charming characters and allies - all trying to make their own way through the Queen’s twisted world - await befriending along your journey. Go camping with Ilda, a tiny mouse on the run from the Queen’s grasp. Explore an abandoned castle with Looter, a mysterious scavenger who searches the queendom for the best wares to steal.</p>
<p>Many more encounters and discoveries await along the way, punctuated by beautiful, hand-drawn medieval-style fairy-tale illustrations.</p>
<p>Not every fable or fairly-tale has a happy ending, and an imposing collection of beast and royally-sized challenges await. Step into the tiny shoes (or feathers) of Glimmer, and perhaps, just perhaps, you’ll be able to re-unite all your sheltered siblings, snatched from the nest one night in a turn of events that lead to the coming of an unlikely, little hero....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No release date is being given yet other than sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>Nice to see fixes coming in for Farlight 84, since a lot of it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/farlight-84-is-now-broken-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">left broken after a recent game update</a>.

      <title>Is This Seat Taken? is a wonderful cosy logic puzzle game where you move people around</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a game I've absolutely adored since trying the demo in February and it's officially out now with Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>A truly lovely cosy puzzle game about playing matchmaker, as you get people to swap seats across various locations to ensure that everyone is happy. The idea behind it is simple and it's really easy to get into thanks to the wonderfully charming art style too. Like all good puzzlers it will start you off slow, but don't let the simple style deceive you, later levels do get a bit on the challenging side but it is all pure logic. Everything makes sense, you just have to fit it all together.</p>
<p>Doesn't take forever to get through either at around 4-8 hours depending on how good you are at it. Check out the launch trailer for it below:</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," says Ausiàs Dalmau Roig, cofounder of Poti Poti Studio. "We have worked hard over the past two years to bring you Is This Seat Taken? and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>They've done it a little weirdly though, instead of just putting up an opt-in Beta it seems you need to request a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2398450/discussions/0/598534283538470240/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">special Beta Steam key</a> to actually get access to it. Probably just so they're not overwhelmed with feedback on it. Once they see it working well enough, the update will be released for everyone.</p>
<p>Nice to see more improvements coming for these classic retro games.</p>

      <title>Become a raging mom trapped in an arcade nightmare in V&#39;s Rage releasing in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>V's Rage is a hand-drawn arcade adventure inspired by the great arcade classics of the '80s and '90s that has no single genre.</p>
<p>The developers just recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2167530/view/497203291915027188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that for the September 2nd release that the "Steam Deck, Linux and MacOS versions are finally ready for launch". Nice to see even more games are actually being tested and supported on Linux platforms directly. This one looks completely nuts too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sPvNtpH0xsk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccff44f387c9e25186522e7c0890fe49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sPvNtpH0xsk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MANY GENRES. ZERO MERCY.</strong></p>
<p>V’s Rage is a hand-drawn arcade adventure inspired by the great arcade classics of the ’80s and ’90s.</p>
<p>Expect frantic combat, absurd enemies, and gameplay rules that change with every stage. Each level throws you into a new experience: Beat ’em up, Shoot ’em up, Run and Gun, Side-scroller.</p>
<p>Learn, fail, swear, repeat. No tutorials, no guidance. Just pure, classic arcade</p>
<p><strong>BETWEEN ARCADE CABINETS AND ’80s ANIME</strong></p>
<p>V’s Rage is rooted in the spirit of old-school coin-ops like Final Fight, Altered Beast, and Parodius.</p>
<p>Its visual style is a hand-drawn explosion of ’80s anime energy, a nostalgic tribute to iconic characters like Lum and Ranma.</p>

      <title>The Minecraft-like free and open source game VoxeLibre v0.90 brings dynamic settings and new fire spreading</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VoxeLibre is a great free and open source sandbox game, a Minecraft-like built on top of the Luanti (Minetest) game engine and a big new release v0.90 is out.</p>
<p>Bringing with it some more advanced features, you can now dynamically adjust the game settings while playing. There's a lot more that's new with this release including a brand new fire spread system, which they said is "more predictable and a single starting point can't burn too large an area – although they can still go quite far".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7028447631754907716gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blazes have been renamed to Fire Elementals with improved behaviour and they said to expect new elemental mobs in the upcoming releases as it's a whole new class of mobs now.</li>
<li>Potions can now stack up to 16, and the duration / power of some potions were increased to be more useful.</li>
<li>The Ghast mob was reworked with a new model, new textures and improved behaviour.</li>
<li>A whole new set of Deepslate tools have been added.</li>
<li>Mobs that pick up armour from the ground will now drop it again when they die.</li>
<li>New golden decorative blocks were added.</li>
<li>Improvements the the creative mode inventory sorting.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://git.minetest.land/VoxeLibre/VoxeLibre/src/branch/master/releasenotes/0_90-the-dynamic-release.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>To get it you need to install Luanti and find VoxeLibre in the built-in content database downloader.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Debian 13 trixie has been released following years of working, bringing lots of new software updates for the popular Linux distribution. Your choice of desktop environment with GNOME 48, KDE Plasma 6.3, LXDE 13, LXQt 2.1.0, and Xfce 4.20. Each with their own set of major changes and new features since the last releases available in Debian.</p>
<p>Quite an important release since it moves to use a 64-bit <em>time_t</em> ABI, supporting dates beyond 2038. It also gained HTTP Boot support, hardening against ROP and COP/JOP attacks on amd64 and arm64, and they're making real progress towards reproducible builds of packages. Additionally, this release adds official support for Debian on riscv64 allowing you to run it on RISC-V hardware.</p>
<p>Debian 13 is supported fully until August 9th, 2028 - after that it moves to a separate LTS team until June 30th, 2030.</p>

      <title>Steam&#39;s Performance Monitor now supports showing CPU temperature</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a small update to the Steam Beta Client to continue working on the newer Performance Monitor.</p>
<p>A feature that has been a wonderful addition to Steam, meaning less third-party software is needed just to get some system performance info. I'm a big fan, although for now I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still use MangoHud</a> since it has more configurable options. The latest update to the Steam Performance Monitor has added support for displaying the CPU temperature on Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>On Windows it needs a kernel driver, whereas on Linux it appears to just work out of the box. For Windows Valve said "The driver is only installed and running when Performance Monitor is visible at full CPU detail levels" unless you disable it in the settings.</p>
<p>So now the full display looks like this (top left in the below picture):</p>

Game pictured - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PEAK</a></p>
<p>Two other changes in the Beta are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse input being offset on macOS when running certain games on high dpi displays.</li>
<li>Fixed game overview window failing to load if there is an issue loading data for popular or favorite guides.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam for ChromeOS Chromebooks is being killed off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another one for the Google (and Valve) graveyard, this time it's Steam for Chromebooks as it's being killed off early next year.</p>
<p>The project has been in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/steam-on-chromebook-is-now-in-beta-with-amd-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta since November 2022</a>, and sadly it's coming to an abrupt close on January 1st, 2026 where installed games will no longer be playable. It will just be entirely gone. As reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/07/steam-chromebook-2026/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, when you now go to install Steam on ChromeOS a message will pop up noting "The Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026. After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming."</p>

<p>A shame but not exactly surprising, the Beta never really went anywhere with not much effort seemingly being put into it to push it further. I've barely heard much at all about it since the 2022 Beta release.</p>
<p>Plus, with all the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/14/chromeos-experience-android/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> on Google looking to in some ways combine Android and ChromeOS together, their focus is clearly elsewhere.</p>
<p>Did any of you use Steam on ChromeOS / Chromebooks?</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve to see if they have anything to add.</em></p>

      <title>Cleaning Up! is an upcoming wholesome and satisfying game about tidying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo available, Cleaning Up! looks like pure joy if you love making things sparkle.</p>
<p>A game all about tidying the mess you find with vacuums, brushes, mops, sprays and more. You're a cleaning gig worker taking on a variety of quests from a hoarder's apartment to an old haunted mansion. There's plenty of variety in the locations and what you'll be doing, including running away from ghosts and solving puzzles.</p>
<p>FromUnbound Creations which is the same developer that made Rain on Your Parade, Just Crow Things, Headliner: NoviNews, HEADLINER and more.</p>
<p>With perhaps a similar feel to other more casual games like PowerWash Simulator, here you also get upgrades too. Grow your prestige to earn cash, allowing you to upgrade tools and purchase new outfits. The developer said the game is "very low-pressure" though, with the ability to revisit levels with new tools to get a better score.</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Configuration And Monitoring Tool (LACT) gets expanded support for older AMD GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux GPU Configuration And Monitoring Tool (LACT) version 0.8.1 has been released, giving you more options for getting the best performance out of your GPU. Since we have no proper GPU control panels on Linux, tools like LACT are a must-have.</p>
<p>This latest release notes it has full V/F curve editing for older AMD GPUs. As the developer said "The RDNA1, Vega and Polaris GPU generations now expose all of the voltage/frequency points in the UI, and not just the minimum and maximum values like previously". With an example shot from a Vega 56:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1522264651754659750gol1.png"/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some other enhancements include profile hooks to let you specify custom commands for profile activation, the app now supports translations, there's improved functionality to enable/disable AMD overclocking, the Lowest/Highest performance levels are now applied correctly when combined with custom clock settings on RDNA GPUs, there's more detailed GPU cache info reporting on AMD and they also fixed extra NVIDIA information (such as ROP count) fetching on multi-GPU systems.</p>
<p>Plus some bug fixes and other smaller tweaks to the UI.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/v0.8.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM Eternal gets modding and DOOM: The Dark Ages gets an endless arena mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Big updates for id Software games DOOM Eternal and DOOM: The Dark Ages have landed and they both sound pretty great.</p>
<p>For DOOM Eternal, the PC Mods Update update enables you to grab over 650 mods made by the community. It includes a new launcher, after being in Beta since last year. The new launcher for DOOM Eternal gives you quick access between the base game and mods. This includes a built-in modding browser, as it does not use Steam Workshop. They've also expanded the DOOM Eternal: idStudio modding tool to include content from all base campaign maps, along with some PvP asset packs, DLC1 &amp; 2 content wads and a Graveyard asset pack for beginners</p>
<p>I've tested and the new launcher does <em>not</em> run with Proton 9.0-4, which is the current stable Proton. However, it did load up fine with<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/proton-10-0-2-beta-brings-even-more-gaming-improvements-to-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> the recent Proton 10.0-2 Beta release</a>. To actually download any mods though, it does <em>require</em> a Bethesda account. Logging in and downloading mods with Proton 10 also works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20955130481754659038gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20955130481754659038gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9575600441754659040gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9575600441754659040gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Testing a quick mod for a demo and yep - all working just fine on Proton 10.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9628586501754659164gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9628586501754659164gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For DOOM: The Dark Ages, Update 2 brings the Ripatorium, a new endless arena mode (with three arenas), two new DOOM Slayer skins and a loopable demo for the Benchmark Mode. Plus a bunch of other smaller improvements and bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Farlight 84 is now broken on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farlight 84 has relaunched with a massive new upgrade that brings a first-person mode, but it's sadly now broken on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this is an anti-cheat issue, or if it's something that Valve now need to fix in the Proton compatibility layer for the fresh update. You can load into the menus just fine, but it will rapidly crash and quit to your Steam Library barely a few minutes into a match.</p>
<p>I'm hoping it's just another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hunt-showdown-1896-broken-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-due-to-easy-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hunt: Showdown 1896 situation</a>, or the numerous times THE FINALS gets momentarily broken instead of being actively blocked like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a> and many others. The bug has been <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6717" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">logged</a> on Valve's Proton GitHub page for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5315821181754597264gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Currently, their Discord support team are simply telling people "the game does not support running under Linux" and just tell people to use Windows. I've sent off an email to their press team to see if we can get a <em>clearer</em> answer.</p>
<p>For now, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a> is listing it as broken until we see what's going on. Be sure to keep an eye on that page for any changes to this and other games. Anti-cheat is proving to be a constant nuisance for gaming on Linux. One day I really hope Valve can solve this repeating issue.</p>

      <title>Terra Nil gets a bit less chill in the free Heatwave Update out now plus a big discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In Terra Nil you're tasked with restoring life to barren environments and things have begun heating up in the new free update. Named Heatwave, the free expansion brings an entirely new region to bring back to life with sandy deserts, salt pans, canyons and floodplains. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's actually in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>13 new animals including crocodiles, elephants, hyenas, and vultures, which appear in the world more naturally and stick around for longer.</li>
<li>A new photography mode that lets you take snapshots of animals in your restored landscapes, with a scoring system that rewards skilled snappers.</li>
<li>3 challenging new maps to tackle: Parched Dunes, Canyon Peaks, and Fracked Floodplain. Bridge vast canyons, douse oil fires, and more.</li>
<li>New eco-tech to play with including a remotely controlled land recycling bot and the Xerophytium, a building used to restore cactus biomes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the fresh update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CFw7lPW6WOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b5af6f679df7bc7efb300de01f82fdc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CFw7lPW6WOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If that's not enough for you - there's also a 60% discount on the game which is the biggest discount it's had so far! So this is a really great time to pick it up and it works wonderfully on Linux systems. It even has a Native Linux version available.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s all the games to claim from Prime Gaming for August 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more games? Here's all that's coming to Prime Gaming in August 2025. An easy way to add more games to your library across Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now. If a game is Steam Deck Playable / Verified it will be SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>Today they've added Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete, THIEF: Definitive Edition and The Academy: The First Riddle.</p>
<p>Across the rest of the month they'll be adding in all these — FATE: The Traitor Soul, Filthy Animals | Heist Simulator, Tin Hearts, Necroking, Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective, Silver Box Classics, Heroes of Loot 2, Fantasy Empires and City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via tools like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher and Lutris</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p>Below is the list of all titles available as of today. <em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>Heretic + Hexen get a definitive re-release with new content from id Software and Nightdive Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-get-bundled-together-with-new-enhanced-versions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with DOOM + DOOM II</a>, Nightdive Studios have remastered the classics Heretic + Hexen as one bundle with new content. Although, they're actually <em>not</em> calling them a "remaster" instead they're opting to call them a "definitive re-release".</p>
<p>Announced today during QuakeCon 2025, they're also Steam Deck Verified right away so you can play them nicely on the go. Which means they also work great on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton. If you owned either of the originals, you should get them free!</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into the definitive re-release of two dark spell-casting shooters that shaped the genre.</p>
<p>Forged by Raven Software on a modified DOOM engine, Heretic and Hexen were released in 1994 and 1995, pushing first person shooters into bold new territory. These innovative cult classics introduced groundbreaking features like inventory systems, vertical aiming, and distinct character classes, reshaping first person action games for generations to come. This enhanced restoration makes Heretic + Hexen available to new audiences and long-time fans with expanded accessibility across more platforms and languages than ever before. Whether you're returning to these shadowy realms or discovering them for the first time, an epic legacy awaits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4268055691754593818gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for what to actually expect from it, you'll get all this in the new enhanced bundle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Owners Receive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders.</li>
<li>Hexen: Beyond Heretic.</li>
<li>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.</li>
<li>Two all-new episodes created in collaboration between individuals at id Software + Nightdive Studios:
	<ul>
<li>Heretic: Faith Renewed</li>
<li>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a total of 117 campaign maps and 120 deathmatch maps in Heretic + Hexen.</p>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players.</li>
<li>Local split-screen deathmatch and co-op for up to 8 players.</li>
<li>Toggleable, enhanced Tome of Power soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult.</li>
<li>Community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.</li>
<li>Improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS.</li>
<li>A Vault section containing concept art and unused sprites from the development of the original games.</li>
<li>Accessibility options, such as updated UI, improved legibility, contrast and screen FX adjustments, and text-to-speech features.</li>
<li>Modern controller support.
	<ul>
<li>Weapon carousel for faster weapon switching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Game balance toggle (original/enhanced).</li>
<li>Quick Save/Load support.</li>
<li>Widescreen support.</li>
<li>Many engine fixes for bugs present in original versions.</li>
<li>Translated into 12 new languages: French, Italian, German, Spanish, LATAM Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really love to see so many classics get upgraded like this. Especially since you get the original classics with them at the same time, so nothing is wiped away by doing this. Best of all worlds.</p>

      <title>Solve mysterious murders in Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders with a launch set for September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders is a richly atmospheric, retro-inspired point-and-click adventure set in Leipzig, Germany at the dawn of the 20th century. The developer has now confirmed it's going to launch on September 4th, with Native Linux support and a demo is available still.</p>
<p>As Kreiser, you’ll examine clues, interrogate suspects, and piece together evidence to solve four murder cases. In a classic point-and-click format, Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders will transport players to a less-explored era of German history.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="appNvUWjeg8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b53dbdfd54a8013ce260d7daac33058c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/appNvUWjeg8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Throughout its development the game has attracted attention within the point-and-click adventure community and has been showcased at events such as AdventureX, Indie Game Fest Cologne, CAGGTUS, and NEXO. It also earned second place in the newcomer category at the Games Innovation Award Saxony (GIAS).</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Uncover vital evidence - Scour beautifully hand-pixellated environments for hidden clues, brought to life with detailed, handcrafted animations. Each scene captures the atmosphere of a bustling 19th-century Leipzig, Germany.</li>
<li>Interrogate suspects and witnesses - Cross paths with witnesses and suspects alike—but it's up to you to tell them apart. Gain their trust, ask the right questions, and uncover what they’d rather keep hidden.</li>
<li>Use your notebook - Keep track of every observation and witness statement in your notebook, where each scene has its own dedicated page for easy reference when you need it most.</li>
<li>Draw your own conclusions - Combine clues in your notebook to unlock new conclusions on your deduction board. Piece together the facts and identify the true culprit from a list of suspects.</li>
<li>Your choices will matter - Your choice of culprit in each of the four cases determines the outcome, making this a true test of your deductive skills. A sharp eye and keen mind are your greatest weapons in the fight against crime.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.0 released with NVIDIA upgrades, Apple Vulkan driver enhancements and lots more improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.0 is officially out now as the latest new feature release of open source graphics drivers for Linux. There's quite a lot of changes with this one from big new features, lots of different drivers seeing enhancements and the usual assortment of bug fixes.</p>
<p>From the mailing list release announcement developer Eric Engestrom said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->This release includes some major house-cleaning of the window system code to remove support for deprecated functionality:<br/>
- DRI2 support has been removed entirely. X11 window system support is now only available through DRI3 or software paths. This should not directly impact users as DRI2 has been deprecated for some time.<br/>
- Support for the insecure legacy GEM names has also been removed and buffer sharing is now only supported using dma-buf file descriptors. This should also not affect users as dma-buf has been the preferred path for about a decade.<br/>
- Support for thread-unsafe libX11 has been removed. Mesa now requires libX11 &gt;= 1.8 (April 2022) which calls XInitThreads() on load and guarantees libX11 is always thread-safe. libX11 must not be built with --disable-thread-safety-constructor since that disables the XInitThreads() call.<br/>
- Support for EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display has been deprecated and is now hidden behind the -Dlegacy-wayland=bind-wayland-display build flag. In order for XWayland to work properly without EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display, distros will need to upgrade to Xwayland &gt;= 24.1 (May 2024).<br/>
<br/>
Another important things is that, as announced during `meson setup` since 25.0.2, the Clover OpenCL implementation has been deleted. RustiCL is now the only OpenCL implementation available, providing support for more OpenCL versions and features and to more hardware than Clover ever did. It is not (yet) perfect though, so please report any issue you find while using it.<br/>
<br/>
NVK has added a dependency on the rustc-hash crate, which has improved shader compile times by an estimated 12%. We believe rustc-hash is already widely packaged, so the hope is that this won't pose much of a burden to packagers.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of NVK, it now supports NVIDIA's Blackwell and Kepler architectures. The old Nouveau GL driver has not been updated for Blackwell and there are no plans to do so. Instead, Nouveau users will only get OpenGL via Zink+NVK on any GPUs after Ada. (Kepler users will still get the old Nouveau GL driver as it is still the default pre-Turing.)<br/>
<br/>
HoneyKrisp, the Apple Vulkan driver, has seen significant performance improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Massive scale RTS game Ashes of the Singularity II announced for 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ashes of the Singularity II has been announced by Oxide Games and Stardock, bringing us the next-generation of massive scale real-time strategy games.</p>
<p>My favourite genre. Something about building up a big army like this and watching the fireworks, every since first discovering the original Dune II and later Command &amp; Conquer. I have great expectations for Ashes of the Singularity II, I just hope it works well with Valve's Proton on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>For this one they have a "significantly" expanded team and scope with them promising some pretty big stuff including "greater strategic depth, intricate base-building dynamics, and intense skirmishes against intelligent computer opponents".<!-- squire --> So far the only official trailer they've put up doesn't show gameplay but here it is anyway:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SV3k4yxWKS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/820069c00a3f2fe5b43d2ccccbb69ae7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Ten years ago, we set a new, literal benchmark for RTS games with massive battles and groundbreaking technology," said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment. "With Ashes of the Singularity II, we’re raising the bar even higher, delivering strategic gameplay depth that RTS fans have always dreamed of.”</p>
<p><!-- squire -->“Obviously, in the first game, the number one request was to have a human faction,” said Wardell. “Back then, we just couldn’t support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines. We’re really excited to bring the humans into the war and watch how they fare against the massive mechanical armies of the Substrate and PHC.”</p>

      <title>NVIDIA say no to adding backdoors and killswitches in their GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released a blog post from chief security officer, fighting back against attempts from pundits and policymakers in governments wanting backdoors.</p>
<p>In the post, David Reber Jr. gives a firm no to the suggestion they should add in anything like a backdoor or killswitch into their hardware noting "NVIDIA GPUs do not and should not have kill switches and backdoors" noting that adding anything like it would be "a gift to hackers and hostile actors". <em>Some words that perhaps the UK Government should take note on, with their repeated attempts (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_ban_proposal_in_the_United_Kingdom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#2</a> and so on) to get backdoors in encryption.</em></p>
<p>The post continues noting how a "good" secret backdoor just isn't a thing "only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated" and ensuring that "no single-point vulnerability can compromise or shut down a system". It all seems so obvious to say doesn't it? But it clearly needs to be repeated as governments simply don't learn. A backdoor for one, is eventually a backdoor for everyone determined to access it.</p>
<p>Reber Jr goes on to give the NSA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Clipper Chip initiative</a> from the 90s as an example of how it just doesn't work. There's more in the post worth reading but the ending note is especially blunt "There are no back doors in NVIDIA chips. No kill switches. No spyware. That's not how trustworthy systems are built — and never will be".</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/no-backdoors-no-kill-switches-no-spyware/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA blog post</a>.</p>

      <title>Odencat released a sweet new adventure in Wish Upon a Cat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celebrating their sixth anniversary as a studio, Japanese developer Odencat have released a free heartwarming adventure with Wish Upon a Cat.</p>
<p>It has Linux support just like the previous games including Bear's Restaurant, Fishing Paradiso and Meg's Monster that all have very positive user reviews. Looks like this will be another lovely little one to go through, and since it's free you can just go and grab it right now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="psi9pXEsWYI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab013633b3475bf14c0591ff013a8731.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/psi9pXEsWYI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I knew things were going to end up like this, I would've just apologized in the first place…"</p>
<p>It's your best friend's birthday—but after a recent fight with her, you're not exactly on speaking terms.</p>
<p>Before you even have a chance to wallow in regret, though, a burst of light erupts from your computer screen and sucks you into an alternate dimension—where a rather snarky mouse gives you the rundown.</p>
<p>A rogue cat with a bad attitude has been leaping between realities and causing all sorts of dimensional mayhem—and if something isn't done to stop it, it might very well cause another big bang. And you DEFINITELY don't want that.</p>
<p>With no other options available, you set off in pursuit of the feisty feline—not just to restore balance to the dimensions, but because it's the only way you'll ever make it back home.</p>
<p>In this short-but-sweet adventure, you'll journey through the many worlds of Odencat games like Bear's Restaurant and Meg's Monster, meeting dozens of familiar friends along the way on your search for the runaway cat.</p>
<p>Why did it throw the dimensions out of whack? What is it this little kitty-cat truly desires? And when all is said and done—what will YOU wish for?</p>

      <title>Bottles app for running Windows apps / games on Linux gets NGI Zero Commons funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The NLnet Foundation <a href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20250804-announcement-grants-CommonsFund.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> more projects receiving funding from NGI Zero Commons, which includes the popular Bottles app for running Windows apps on Linux.</p>
<p>Not heard of the NGI Zero Commons Fund before? From the NLnet Foundation it's designed to help support free and open source software. They receive financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme and even the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI).</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-08-04-nlnet-commons-fund/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> from the Bottles team they note it will go towards work on Bottles Next, as they're rebuilding the software to improve all parts of it. Back in <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-07-06-bottles-need-help/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">early July</a>, the Bottles developers put out a call for more support, so it's nice to see it answered.</p>
<p>While a lot of people use software like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic and Lutris</a>, Bottles is just another tool in the box that you can use to make running Windows software a little bit easier.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/nvidia-beta-driver-580-65-06-released-for-linux-with-bug-fixes-and-expanded-wayland-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">releasing a new Beta series recently</a>, NVIDIA have now put up driver version 570.181 as the latest recommended stable driver for Linux.</p>
<p>Here we go again though, we get a one-liner vague <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/drivers/details/252486/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>. Are you ready for this? The improvements noted are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When this happened previously, NVIDIA stealthily <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added support for a newer GPU</a>. The time after with another vague changelog, I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-570-172-08-released-for-linux-as-the-main-stable-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speculated that it was possibly for unrevealed security issues</a> — which turned out to be correct when NVIDIA later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-reveal-more-gpu-driver-security-issues-for-july-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced some more security flaws</a>. So it's entirely possible we may get another security bulletin sometime soon. As always, GamingOnLinux will let you know when we have any details of that or anything else.</p>

      <title>After being banned for sale VILE: Exhumed has released for free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was going to release on Steam but it was removed and banned for sale, now VILE: Exhumed is back as a free game to fight back against censorship. <em>With the release it's now under the CC BY-NC-ND license.</em></p>
<p>Not caught up on what's going on? This is one game that was caught up in the recent campaign to have certain games with adult themes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed for sale on Steam and itch.io</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform also recently talking about it too</a>.</p>
<p>The developer said that 50% of the profits will go towards the "Red Door Family Shelter, a Toronto based charity that focuses on helping families, refugees, and women who are escaping violence". Writing on the website the developer posted a statement about the situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game covers topics of assault, abuse, and entitlement, and uses a combination of FMV and practical effects to create images as horrifying as the themes. This was never a secret. There are a lot of intense visuals in VILE: Exhumed, but there is no uncensored nudity, no depictions of sex acts, and no pornography whatsoever – which is one of the justifications bad actors are using right now to censor games.</p>
<p>What this actually results in is taking power and storytelling away from women, other marginalized artists, and ultimately, from everyone.</p>
<p><strong>This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content.</strong></p>
<p>They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. </p>
<p>By giving the game away, for free, to whoever wants to play it, I am doing the same thing I set out to do when I started working on VILE: Exhumed, a game about sexual assault, male entitlement, and misogyny. Taking back my agency. </p>
<p>No one is allowed to dictate what kind of horror is acceptable, or what stories are allowed to be told.</p>

<p>Editor's Note: these bans and removals don't work. All that ends up happening is games and other content move elsewhere, and people go looking in darker places. We know how these things go, and now with all the age verification in the UK and coming to other countries, the situation is only going to get worse. </p>

      <title>Portal: Revolution drops Native Linux support to focus on Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Second Face Software have announced that their incredibly popular Portal: Revolution mod for Portal 2 has dropped the Native Linux build.</p>
<p>They've had a Native Linux build for a long time, but it became quite problematic and they weren't able to solve the issues players kept encountering. So instead, they're going to ensure it works with Proton where the issues didn't happen.</p>
<p>As they mentioned in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/601360/announcements/detail/509587556478748640" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Portal: Revolution, from the start, has included a native Linux build. As some players have recently reported, it was broken because of recent Steam updates. To fix this we have decided to remove the native Linux binaries in favour of Proton. Don't panic.</p>
<p>Our native Linux build sucked. You may have experienced frequent hangs and stutters related to gel rendering or other strange bugs. This stems from a bug in our multithreaded rendering code for gel blobs, and despite our best efforts we were not able to fix it. To make matters worse, it only happens on the native Linux build. Windows and Proton are not affected.</p>
<p>Because of these two reasons we'll ditch the native build and run the game through Proton. Performance should be comparable, if not even better at times and stability is definitely improved. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version, so this means it will need to be reviewed again with Proton by Valve, otherwise it will cause problems on Steam Deck. For now, you may need to manually opt into using Proton for it in the properties -&gt; Compatibility menu for the game on Steam to run properly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cXczxIIvXJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc22ee41837af784c9560db29b9d810f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cXczxIIvXJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In related news, earlier this year they also announced Portal: Revolution 2 is in development, so there's more fun to come for Portal fans.</p>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast looks absolutely brutal in the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really hope Techland learned some lessons from Dying Light 2, as I have high hopes for Dying Light: The Beast. The latest trailer certainly makes it look fun, as short as it is.</p>
<p>Dying Light (the original) is still one of the best open-world zombie games, but Dying Light 2 just wasn't even close to being as good. This time around Techland seem to be putting a lot more effort into the overall body-horror aspect to it, with overhauled gore systems that look like a lot of fun to play with.</p>
<p>Check out the brief teaser trailer on some of it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SyhySFnQpmg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45652f94b3a3be693485df968dc508b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SyhySFnQpmg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "We’ve overhauled the body damage system," explains Nathan Lemaire, Game Director. "We doubled the number of places on enemies - we call them Gore-Nodes - where players can inflict damage and the number of wounds or injuries that are visible on one single enemy. And we improved the precision of melee attacks - so the angle and trajectory of your strike defines what you hit and how your enemies react to it. So you can target and cut off limbs more precisely than ever!"</p>
<p>To have a realistic representation of gore in Dying Light: The Beast, the art team went to some lengths. "We’ve improved all of the visuals of wounds and injuries and match them with all of the body types. The research was extensive - I just hope no one ever looks up my browser history," says Dominik Wasieńko, Lead Character Artist.</p>

      <title>JetBrains now a Platinum sponsor of Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Foundation announced that JetBrains have become a Platinum sponsor of Godot Engine development, helping push this cross-platform open source game engine.</p>
<p>Looking at Godot's sponsorship levels, this means JetBrains will be providing at least €36,000 a year. However, it does not give JetBrains any sway at all. Many companies and groups already help to fund Godot including Scorewarrior, The Khronos Group, W4 Games, Megacrit, Robot Gentleman, Re-Logic, Broken Rules, Chasing Carrots and others.</p>
<p>Currently, the Godot team are receiving €35,992 a month in funding from 1,521 members and 18 sponsors in total.</p>
<p>JetBrains said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At JetBrains, we value the diversity of thought and experience in the software industry, such as the many different programming languages and related ecosystems. We can see that there is ample scope for multiple game engines, especially so for a not-for-profit, open-source game engine. Development happens thanks to the dedication of contributors and paid volunteers, and we welcome the chance to support passionate people making a difference with a successful community project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you still waiting for Godot? Maybe time to try it out if you're a game developer.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown 1896 broken on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 06/08/2025 - 9:37am UTC</strong>: while Crytek did not reply to GamingOnLinux, they have fixed the issue and the game works again. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our anti-cheat page</a> has been updated to note it works again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below…</em></p>
<p>Here we go again? Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a popular extraction shooter from Crytek that's now broken on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>Just recently the developers put out a small update with version 2.4.0.2 fixing a couple of bugs, but the side-effect is that the Easy Anti-Cheat system seems to now be either disabled for Linux systems or left broken. Quite frustrating to see, with no announcements from the developer.</p>
<p>I've tested with Proton 9 and Proton Experimental and both just give the same issue, the game will load and then eventually give you an error box like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6486112621754395490gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's quite a number of posts on their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/594650/discussions/8/594030422158053461/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> forum about it, and the bug is already logged on Valve's <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3898#issuecomment-3149923205" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for Proton. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible by Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20421985221754395417gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've reached out to Crytek press to see if they have anything to share, will update if they reply.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> was updated to reflect the current status. Be sure to keep an eye on it for any changes for this and other games on Linux.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are working on a &#34;general optimization&#34; for VKD3D / DirectX12 games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For a while now Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs have been reporting performance issues with DirectX12 titles using VKD3D, but a fix may <em>finally</em> be coming.</p>
<p>A post was opened on the NVIDIA forum all the way back in August 2024, with it building up multiple hundreds of replies over time from different users talking about the performance issues. There's many posts about it elsewhere, and you often find the advice to Linux gamers building systems is to use an AMD GPU, with one of the biggest issues (aside from open source drivers) being the performance difference especially for DirectX12 titles.</p>
<p>Sometime soon, that annoying performance problem might be a thing of the past. On August 5th, NVIDIA developer amrits <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/432" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi All,<br/>
While looking at Horizon Zero Dawn Linux performance we identified a general optimization that benefits multiple titles with VKD3D. It is still in development. We will give an update when it is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same NVIDIA developer did post back in <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/279" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">June</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really apologize for not communicating earlier.<br/>
Team is currently investigating performance issues, and we do have identified the root cause for Horizon Zero Dawn and are working on a fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So no time-frame and no other information, just that something is actually properly in progress and it will now benefit multiple titles.</p>
<p>Really hope to see it arrive soon!</p>

      <title>openSUSE Leap 16.0 will need Steam gamers to install some extras due to no 32-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>openSUSE Leap 16.0 has entered the Release Candidate phase, and for anyone gaming on Steam with openSUSE Leap you'll need some tweaks. openSUSE doesn't actually register in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's data for the top Linux distributions used</a>, but still some might be interested to know about this.</p>
<p>In the RC <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2025/08/04/leap-16-rc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>, there's this bit noted for Steam users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="steam-wine-32-bit-support"><strong>Steam, Wine, 32-bit support</strong></p>
<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise 16.0 does not support 32-bit binary execution.<br/>
Leap users can install <code class="inline-code">grub2-compat-ia32</code>, which enables it by passing <code class="inline-code">ia32_emulation=1</code> to the kernel.<br/>
We’ve recently dropped Steam from the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Package_repositories#Non-OSS" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Non-OSS repository</a> due to a limited set of 32-bit libraries.<br/>
Steam users will want to install <code class="inline-code">selinux-policy-targeted-gaming</code>, which is not installed by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/fedora-proposal-to-drop-32-bit-support-has-been-withdrawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with Fedora</a> when a proposal was put to drop 32-bit didn't we? Sounds like another messy situation. <em>I wonder how much backlash this will end up causing for the openSUSE Leap developers.</em></p>
<p>To me, all this says is that openSUSE Leap 16.0 is not going to be a good pick for gaming on Linux. And that's fine, not every Linux distribution out there needs to focus on every possible use case, but this will cause friction for people. Then again, if you're using something like openSUSE Leap, you're probably a seasoned Linux user.</p>

      <title>Oblivion remade in the Skyrim engine, Skyblivion is on the final stretch to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Skyblivion is a remake of Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, something that has been exciting RPG fans for a while and it's finally coming soon.</p>
<p>More about it from the developers of the mod: "Skyblivion is the ultimate fan-made experience for the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, bringing the game into the newer engine of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. This process combines Oblivion’s impressive award-winning open-world that is renowned for its incredible gameplay, memorable quests, and expansive world space with the advancements in gaming that have been made in the last two decades. Set in the Elder Scroll’s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion."</p>
<p>The developers put up a sixth development diary video going over the progress on August 3rd, the first update since the release of the official Oblivion Remastered. Clearly, this hasn't deterred them for pushing forward on Skyblivion. Answering the question on "what's the point of it now?", in the video they mention how Skyblivion is actually a "full-scale remake that re-imagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards".</p>

      <title>Keep a close eye on your kingdom in The King is Watching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The King is Watching from Hypnohead and tinyBuild is a unique micro-management roguelite kingdom builder that will suck you right in. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's a strange blend of kingdom building micro-management for the resources and production, along with real-time auto-battle when it comes to the action. You place down building tiles in a small area, and move around your gaze to make the tiles actually activate and run their production. Your gaze tile range is limited, so it's a game of constant micro where you're always watching your resources to build them up, and then move your gaze around again to build up something else. Impressively clever, and very different to other such games and due to this your full attention will be completely absorbed by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19824855411754390365gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19824855411754390365gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You know, it actually reminded me a little of Tetris in the way you're arranging the kingdom tiles and your gaze together. At least initially that is. It's obviously nothing like it, but I couldn't help but feel that when starting off in it. It's all about making perfect use of the space you've got to maximise your resource income with your limited area of gaze. Getting the tiles in the right place is one of the most difficult things about it, and can easily make you lose if you're not prepared enough. Thankfully, you can move tiles at any time, they just suffer a temporary production penalty for being moved.</p>
<p>While it's an RTS (real time strategy) game, it's more like real time <em>staring</em>. You don't directly interact with your troops, only the kingdom tiles although you do get to interact in certain other ways like spells. Some of the spells will truly save your kingdom too, I <em>completely</em> screwed up on one run and entirely ran out of Wheat so I couldn't produce any troops, but I did have a Tornado spell that mopped the floor with the enemies and saved my kingdom.</p>
<p>Everything is about your watchful eye, like some sort of Eye of Sauron – only you're just a <em>little</em> bit nicer. You can also pause at any time, which you'll end up making great use of to plan ahead a little on your resources.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cjpJH8nYHaY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73ab9760c962a6dfb9ecd06bcb9fc616.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cjpJH8nYHaY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the kingdom building, you only get a limited selection of tiles to begin with. To get more, you need to progress through the battles to get them as rewards. Which is interesting on how it works with other systems in the game, like prophecies that let you tweak what enemy waves you'll end up getting, so you can choose to fight tougher enemies for better rewards including better buildings, more money, new spells and so on. But there's also a trader where you can spend some of your built-up cash for buildings, resources and other assorted upgrades.</p>
<p>Quite a few ways to enhance your runs to with meta-progression taken from roguelikes. There's a currency you acquire to unlock special buildings to interact with before you start a run, where you can go through upgrades, there's different kings to unlock and each have their own unique buffs and abilities to unlock and more.</p>
<p>What's the actual goal here? To progress through and survive as many waves as possible, to defeat the bosses that come along. You always know what's coming though, thanks to the timeline bar along the top of the screen that tells you exactly what you'll be facing. Easier said than done though and total efficiency is key here. It's a constant tug of war between ensuring you have enough resources (and the correct resources) to build up your army, as you click around your gaze constantly across your little kingdom to tweak your production.</p>
<p>The only problem with it is that there's currently no mid-run save feature, which feels like an absolutely <em>crazy</em> thing to miss, especially in a strategy game like this. Thankfully, the developers have confirmed it's on the way and the update with it is currently in Beta. Once that's actually released for everyone, it will then get a true double thumbs up from me. Still, it's good without it, but will be actually <em>great</em> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10427730531754390804gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10427730531754390804gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The King is Watching is a complete time sink in all of the best ways with a very satisfying gameplay loop, and it's a surprising challenge to be able to beat it. With the game tested on Kubuntu Linux 25.04 it runs perfectly out of the box with Proton 9.0-4.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We’ve had amazing support from fans and the community throughout this journey, and we’re beyond thrilled to share The King is Watching with the world," said Semyon Itmaniuk, Head of the Hypnohead Studio. "Embrace the monarchy, and craft a kingdom from the ground up into the most fearsome of them all. Huzzah!"</p>

      <title>Physics-based brawler Stick It to the Stickman from Free Lives arrives August 18</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free Lives, developers of Broforce and Terra Nil, have confirmed their next game Stick It to the Stickman is set to arrive on August 18th. It will enter Early Access first, with a full release due in approximately 12 months.</p>
<p>What is it? Stick it to the Stickman is a physics-based brawler where you fight minimum wage stickmen to become a CEO. Choose from hundreds of unique moves to construct the perfect combat machine, then battle your way to the top of the corporate ladder. The developers say you will "Fight other CEOs for the prestige of employing the CEO with the biggest muscles. Perform dubiously legal tasks critical to expanding the company, including stealing cars, suppressing protestors and kidnapping building inspectors—all in the name of profit".</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wild physics-based stickman combat featuring a vast array of brutal weapons and over-the-top special moves, including fireballs, chainsaws and katanas.</li>
<li>Combines multiple gameplay styles including platforming, brawling, autobattling, delivery, car theft, free-running and kicking people out of windows.</li>
<li>Play solo or with a ‘friend’ and defeat hordes of red stickmen to secure your promotion. But be warned: everybody else wants the job too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems it will have Native Linux support again too as it was just added as "TBC" on Steam. If not, there's always Proton.</p>

      <title>A Portal dating sim? Yep. Aperture Dating Simulator is set to release on August 28</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes I think I've seen it all, and then along comes a Portal dating sim with Aperture Dating Simulator.</p>
<p>Created by Ashleyanna Rivers, this fully-voiced dating sim is set in Valve's popular Portal universe, but not the same one you know and love. And clearly Valve approve of it, since they're letting it release on Steam. The dev says it's not "your average fan-made Portal game" in an alternate universe that will show you a new Aperture.</p>
<p>You take control of a manufacturing employee thrust out of their element and into maintenance, where you'll meet 8 brand-new personality cores, each with their own special little quirks. There's 18 possible endings to find and over 30 cut-scenes with "a lot this little dating sim parody has to offer" (or so they hope).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Cult of PiN, a pinball roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cult of PiN has a seriously cool style that merges pinball with roguelikes, and now you can try it out early.</p>
<p>There's a Windows demo you can run via Proton for now on Steam, or play right in the browser on their itch.io page. The developer mentioned Linux and macOS versions are planned too. This is easily one of the absolute coolest takes on mixing up classic pinball into something new.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cult of PiN is a roguelike Pinball game requiring sharp reflexes and strategic combos. Collect powerful Glyphs to enhance your damage, and smash your way through as many stages as you can to claim a place on the global leaderboard.</p>
<p>Master the cradled ramp shot, hit hard-to-reach mission targets, and purchase run-altering mystical Glyphs to beat each table stage, destroying all the bumpers to move onto the next one. Discover hidden bonus tables and unlock new Balls and Glyphs for future runs. Perfect your nudge and trick shot skills to reach Act VI on each table to claim victory. After that, continue playing in endless mode to secure your spot on the leaderboards for each table.</p>

      <title>The Drifter is easily my new favourite point and click adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Drifter from Powerhoof has released, and it is something truly special for the point and click adventure genre that's one not to be missed. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I've long been a fan of the point and click genre, growing up playing some classics on the Amiga. I've also played a lot of modern takes on it, but I never quite get the feeling I did from back then. Until now, that is. The Drifter is truly exceptional and just does about everything right to hook you in. Not only does it have some seriously great pixel art, but the voice acting is truly amazing too.</p>
<p>My favourite thing though? The interface. While I'm sure there's some that will get their pitchforks out to stick me with on this, I played it with a gamepad. I know — sacrilege right? But wait! The Drifter was designed for both sides of the fence. The gamepad interface they designed is impressively easy to use and feels so natural that it made sitting back and relaxing with it just a wonderful experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2GiHlkE2z8g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3b55ef55113b5e157d6aab5659d6434e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2GiHlkE2z8g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the first few minutes, it will totally absorb you into the world, especially so thanks to the intro. You have absolutely no idea what's going on, but you really will want to know more. You will need to know more. What was that crazy guy on about? Was he actually just crazy or is there something bigger going on? Why were people firing at you and who are they? So many questions will start popping into your head. It certainly sets the scene nicely for the adventure you're about to go through. And that only continues the more you go into it, as things just start getting plain weird like out of some Netflix sci-fi drama, especially with the loops around death.</p>
<p>The voice acting is what really pulls you in though, mainly thanks to the main character Mick voiced by Adrian Vaughan (but they're all good). There's some great dialogue in there and Vaughan really helps to sell it all, especially with some of the complete silliness that goes on. I'm a bit of a sucker for a deep, gruff but soothing voice. I especially liked the way the conversations flow, with it jumping between characters talking and getting little bits of backstory from Vaughan narrating things and even with the flicking between talking and narrating it all feels so smooth.</p>
<p>It's not just the voice acting though, the soundtrack is brilliant too. Really brings out the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you're after an adventure that will make you scratch your brain with puzzles, this is not the one, the puzzles here are interesting but more like set-pieces to stop it being a constant run through the story. Most of it is pretty obvious, which is not a bad thing, the puzzles are gentle on your brain to make you feel like you're actually doing something. However, the design is interesting with the puzzles often being done across multiple scenes with you needing various items, often combining them together. The result is some fun item hunting and silly events involving the items you're using.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Pulp Adventure Thriller from the minds that brought you Peridium and Crawl.</li>
<li>An engrossing roller-coaster of a story- Drawing on King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse.</li>
<li>Point 'n Click or Controller- Unique twin-stick controls make The Drifter as comfy to play on the couch as at your PC.</li>
<li>Bursting with raw crunchy pixel art and high-impact animation.</li>
<li>Professionally voice acted, with a brooding dark-synth cinematic score.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All together from the animations to the voice acting and the slick gamepad interface you owe it to yourself to play this one. Seriously impressive, a double thumbs up from me. Do not skip it. It's going to be hard to enjoy another point and click adventure if it's not up to the quality of The Drifter in future.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and runs great out of the box. Also Steam Deck Verified. No performance issues or special bugs worth noting.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.18.1 brings more bug fixes for GOG and Epic Games on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic is one of the best ways to run games from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games, GOG and Amazon on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</a>. v2.18.1 brings bug fixes to make it even smoother.</p>
<p>It's a <em>hotfix</em>, so it's mainly to clear up problems from the last major release. One change they've actually <em>reverted</em> for this release was quite controversial, where Heroic was hiding various versions of Proton by default (except GE-Proton). Now, it only hides Proton Experimental and is an opt-in feature. Part of their reasoning was to keep it simple for users, with GE-Proton using a special set of proton fixes to make games outside of Steam work well. Turns out it caused issues though. More can be read about it in the original <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/4254" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub post</a> and comments.</p>
<p>Additionally they mentioned they've "fixed the Environmental variables table and added a few couple of settings for using WoW64 on Linux and several other fixes and improvements".</p>

      <title>x86 on ARM64 emulator FEX gets some huge gaming improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FEX is one way to run x86 appps and games on ARM64, with the latest release 2508 bringing some pretty striking performance improvements.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2508/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about "Big juicy JIT optimizations", they showed off two charts of the performance difference versus the previous release and in some cases for gaming it's a huge win. Like with Cyberpunk 2077 seeing a 38.9% improvement which is massive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7428137801754321418gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7428137801754321418gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14722959531754321417gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14722959531754321417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Explaining some of the improvements the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p>The majority of this performance uplift has come from call-return stack optimizations, where we are now able to take advantage of the ARM CPU’s own call-return prediction hardware, but we have had a variety of optimizations this month that improve both JIT compilation time in addition to execution time! Additionally now we compile significantly less code since we would have combinatorial explosion of JIT compiles when multiblock was enabled. We have now made it so each individual block of JIT code is freestanding and usually only gets compiled once.</p>
<p>Another improvement this month is the WINE wow64/arm64ec libraries can now take advantage of Apple Silicon’s hardware TSO feature. This happened to not be implemented with the wow64/arm64ec code path. This will significantly improve performance on that hardware in the case that someone spent the effort to run a game in that environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More work also went into supporting anti-tamper tech, with some versions of Denuvo potentially now working too but more work is to be done on that.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 580.65.06 released for Linux with bug fixes and expanded Wayland support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released the first Beta for the 580 driver series, with NVIDIA Beta driver 580.65.06 bringing mostly bug fixes. There's also an additional bit of Wayland protocol support included.</p>
<p>Since this is a Beta driver, it's not recommended just yet for everyday use. You'll want to be quite up to date though, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-reveal-more-gpu-driver-security-issues-for-july-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA recently revealing more security issues</a> in their drivers.</p>
<p>Highlights from the driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Vulkan applications to hang when destroying swapchains after a lost device event.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could allow atomic commit and other DRM operations to return success status despite having failed due to handling an interrupt: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause GTK 4 applications to crash when using the Vulkan backend on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could intermittently cause llama.cpp to crash on exit when using the Vulkan backend: <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528</a></li>
<li>Added support for the fifo-v1 Wayland protocol on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Updated GPU clock value reporting in nvidia-settings, NVML, and nvidia-smi to show clocks before thermal and idle slowdowns for better consistency with the equivalent functionality on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with Bigscreen Beyond Head Mounted Displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in a black screen when setting specific modes on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused blank or frozen screens under the following conditions: nvidia-drm is loaded with the modeset=1 and fbdev=1 parameters, using a Maxwell or Pascal series GPU, and more than one display device of differing resolutions are connected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-suspend.service to fail when available system memory is low.</li>
<li>Enabled RMIntrLockingMode by default. This feature can help reduce stutter especially when using virtual reality. This feature was originally introduced in the r570 series. It can be disabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=0` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Implemented another feature that can reduce time spent in the interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts by deferring the work until later. This feature is experimental and disabled by default. This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>

      <title>Frostliner announced recently is basically Snowpiercer as a survival city-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay, now this is cool. Frostliner puts you in charge of a train in this survival city builder on rails that's practically Snowpiercer. <em>I also only just realised today that Snowpiercer's final Season 4 did actually release…last year. </em></p>
<p>This blends a lot of gameplay elements together that seems quite unique. Your city is constantly moving, with combat elements that has a sort-of tower defense style to it. There's also an events system where all sorts of things can happen, and of course lots can go wrong. The developer said they're hoping to run a playtest later this year to get some feedback.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5yLJ37k6wQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/444afc35795e2db761f6a3db911683ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5yLJ37k6wQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct a massive train called the Frostliner, which is capable of creating its own train carriages which can then be filled with facilities, and utilise adjacency bonuses which make the train more productive the larger it is.</li>
<li>Roam the frozen landscape, frequently stopping to gather much needed supplies, clear debris and recruit new passengers. However, once the train stops the player is on a timer as their reserved batteries powering the trains heaters quickly drain.</li>
<li>The train runs on fuel and the player must do whatever they can to keep it fueled and running.</li>
<li>Research new technologies, facilities and improvements such as the corpse furnace which allows passengers to be “converted” into the much needed fuel that the engine needs. Unlock new tiers of passengers with much greater demands, but more powerful bonuses and facilities.</li>
<li>The train is a treasure trove for the survivors and entities in the wasteland and they will do what they can to take the train. Any of these enemies you don’t manage to destroy will become pursuers, following behind your train until you are inevitably forced to stop. Increase the trains speed to stay one step ahead, or invest in defences to eradicate the threats before they become a problem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right to the top of my wishlist you go.</p>

      <title>Click through the joy of opening up mystery boxes in Unboxathon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your chilled casual clicker games, Unboxathon could be a good one for you with a demo available to try.</p>
<p>What is it? A sweet content-filled game about opening up mysterious boxes. You have no idea what you're going to find. It's a clicker / incremental game, so it's all about collecting things to keep on upgrading to get more shiny new things. Only this one is about opening up boxes. In the demo you get access to 2 out of the 6 unlockable boxes, and 10% of the tech tree unlocks compared to the full version.</p>
<p>Check out their teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u-lOd6tW2Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76e77eea789f1959070b26811f6a09b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u-lOd6tW2Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pop ‘Til You Drop: </strong>Pop all manner of bubbles, big, small and with different gameplay effects and bonuses to earn additional mystery boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Literal Boxes Full of Loot: </strong>Open up boxes of different rarities, including “Magical Relics” or “Luxury Goods” to get increasingly valuable loot and shiny, collectible items.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade: </strong>Sell those items for profit and use those earnings to unlock incremental upgrades affecting your bubble bonuses, special bubbles, box quality, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo worked perfectly with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Dice A Million channels Balatro vibes into game-breaking dice rolling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a fresh demo released, Dice A Million looks like it will grab a lot of my time in future. It gives off Balatro vibes for the design, as you roll dice and attempt to break the game with all sorts of combinations to watch numbers go up. <em>Delicious.</em></p>
<p>So what exactly is it? As the developer said: "Dice A Million is a roguelike deckbuilder about rolling dice to try and get to a million points. Combine the effects of more than 100 different dice and discover powerful synergies. Get through ever-increasing debts and fearsome bosses that will require a perfect symbiosis in your deck in order to be beaten."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mmJnr785cFk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/155e433ba5dd6fd893ca511bda9f25e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mmJnr785cFk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Randomly generated runs, roguelike style!</li>
<li>More than 100 dice with unique effects.</li>
<li>More than 50 rings with passive effects to completement your build.</li>
<li>6 different enchantments that could drastically modify the behaviour of your dice.</li>
<li>Many different hands (classes) to choose from.</li>
<li>Hundreds of unlocks and secret achievements.</li>
<li>20 one-time use cards to help you fight RNG.</li>
<li>Millions of points.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also announced they're working with 2 Left Thumbs to help with publishing. It's due out sometime later this year and should run fine with Proton.</p>

      <title>Gyro through a collection of handcrafted mazes in the Steam Deck exclusive Game With Balls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second game from Geert Verhoeff that's only meant to be played on a Steam Deck is Game With Balls, a collection of handcrafted mazes to gyro through. A demo is available for the game right now to get a taste of it.</p>
<p>Check out their teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7svS7yqUZ2o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b81995aefbc6ad34248a8e14b258650.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7svS7yqUZ2o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game With Balls! A little collection of handcrafted mazes for the Steam Deck, where you use gyro movement to navigate one of the balls through them. Are you the one with the best time among your friends—or even in the world?!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Over 40 levels handcrafted in the real world using real wood, drawings, and other materials, then converted for your digital pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional 10 challenges that not only test you on the time it takes to complete each level but also on other objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeps track of your fastest times using Steam Leaderboards, so you can see if you’re the quickest among your friends—or the fastest in the world!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect all secrets in every level to not only be the fastest but also the ultimate completist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original soundtrack to relax to (or maybe not when you’re trying to beat your friends’ times).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting to see, although probably only a small market for such a thing. Previously they released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943100/Better_With_A_Friend/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Better With A Friend</a>, collection of hand drawn mini-games for the Steam Deck which only has 10 user reviews on Steam.</p>

      <title>Queer Games Bundle 2025 is live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At a time where supporting creators of anything that might be deemed adult content or NSFW is more important than ever, the Queer Games Bundle 2025 is live.</p>
<p>With all the payment processor issues ongoing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">across Steam, itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a> - it's only a matter of time until the target for having games removing is expanded to include queer-focused games too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16754351881754302323gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer in this bundle a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and in exchange, you get over 600 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.  In a chaotic, grim time with new attacks daily on queer and especially trans people, queer art is something that does more than simply keep you alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's two options to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itch.io/b/3062/queer-games-bundle-2025-with-10-option" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The full $60 option for those than can afford it</a></li>

      <title>ZOOM Platform also had payment processor issues, say they &#34;have no plans to remove any titles&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZOOM Platform that sell a lot of retro games, as well as publish upgrades for retro games, announced they've also been a target of payment processors for adult games.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a "fellow member of the industry" was concerned about our content. After we heard from the payment processor, we immediately engaged in lengthy discussions with both PayPal and Stripe. We worked with our contacts at the aforementioned payment processors to develop a tripartite solution to ensure the right to free speech and freedom of expression as well as protect the safety of our valued customers and partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've now added opt-in two-factor authentication, they're looking at alternative payment options and also a wallet system. While also saying they have "no plans" to remove any titles and will "do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings".</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux, one of their team said they expect the de-listing situation to expand further and in their discussions titles like "Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as potentially at risk".</p>
<p>As we already expected, NSFW games being a target was only ever going to be a first step. <em>There's always more to it.</em></p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.10 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 2! Today we are happy to announce a new version of the <strong><strong>fheroes2</strong></strong> game engine - <strong><strong>1.1.10</strong></strong> (<a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10</a>)! This update brings several art enhancements, Editor fixes, and more!</p>
<p>This release includes multiple improvements to the <strong><strong>Editor</strong></strong>. First, the team fixed several crashes related to reaching the object placement limit. We also resolved a few passability and rendering issues. Lastly, the Castle’s options window now supports cancelling all changes made there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10535542011754301309gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team reworked several in-game dialogs, updated <strong><strong>buttons</strong></strong> for various languages, made buttons resizable in many cases, and fixed font inconsistencies. We also added sorting for save files by name or date, and introduced an icon for the <strong><strong>Virtual Keyboard</strong></strong> button.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19572054401754301331gol1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21197202721754301351gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This release features numerous art updates. The <strong><strong>Magic Book</strong></strong> now shows a visual indicator when no pages are available. We fixed white pixels in the <strong><strong>Sorceress castle sky and rainbow</strong></strong>, and added missing bay artwork for the <strong><strong>Wizard castle</strong></strong>. Additionally, we improved the <strong><strong>Swordsman's walking animation</strong></strong> by adding a new frame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8664132941754301381gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623044641754301382gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Alongside these changes, the team updated translations for several languages, resolved more issues on the Adventure Map, and closed over <em><em>40 issues</em></em> since the last release. As a nice bonus, we have included a new community-made map in the fheroes2 bundle: <strong><strong>Good, Bad, Magne</strong></strong>, and we updated the Eruption map in the bundle.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the updated version of the engine. Thank you so much for supporting the project!</p>
<p>Don't forget, that you also need to grab the data from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>Steam Survey for July 2025 shows Linux approaching 3%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the data for the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for July 2025, showing the Linux user share making gains towards hitting 3%.</p>
<p>We continue to see the slow but steady increase in the overall Linux user share on the desktop, good news for the health of the platform as more people realise just how good Linux is now.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the current operating system share on Steam for July 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.23% -0.44%</li>
<li>Linux 2.89% +0.32% </li>
<li>macOS 1.88% +0.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> for the charts, we can see that steady increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15167707281754127729gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15167707281754127729gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Plus the breakdown of Linux distributions that were popular across July 2025 on Steam. This is possibly the most expansive list Valve has given for the distribution breakdown yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 28.31% -2.73%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.82% +0.33%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.83% -0.07%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.54% -0.08%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.44% +0.23%</li>
