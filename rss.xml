      <title>Space Dingus is a spiritual sequel to Death Road to Canada</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Road to Canada is a lot of fun and so I have great expectations for the next game from Rocketcat Games, which is a spiritual sequel named Space Dingus.</p>
<p>They actually announced it a couple of weeks ago, which I entirely missed due to the overflowing amount of news lately. So I imagine a lot of readers missed it too. I'm always on the lookout for more online co-op games to play with my crew and this could fit the bill. A co-op horror road trip you say? With ship management? And full modding support? Oh I'm in, sounds awesome.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Giving a little detail on what to expect from it they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going to be keeping a lot of familiar gameplay compared to Death Road, such as the Choose your own Adventure Events, general structure for picking your locations, and giant swarms of enemies. There will also be a lot of differences from Death Road. Here's a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer! This was a huge request from Death Road to Canada, now possible with the new engine we built.</li>
<li>Mouse aiming controls! You can see this and the headshot system in the Teaser Trailer.</li>
<li>Between picking locations, you have a big customizable Spaceship as a hub area.</li>
<li>Multiple enemy factions! A few will be the "slow zombie" archetype, and even those will have new twists that set them apart from both Death Road's zombies, and each other.</li>
<li>Goofy, giant swan dives that will get you killed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>

      <title>Splitgate 2 is &#34;going back to beta&#34; with the original shutting down as 1047 Games have layoffs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>1047 Games have announced that Splitgate 2 is going to be reworked, and they're shutting down the original Splitgate. The developers have also announced that due to all this they've made the "incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/510712444576860070" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> posted on Steam and Reddit notes how they "launched too early" and that they "bit off more than we could chew" with certain parts of it rushed, along with making a number of "boneheaded mistakes". Mistakes like wearing that utterly<em> <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/524753701753210187gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stupid hat</a></em> on stage, which caused a whole lot of controversy. The insanely expensive micro-transactions certainly didn't help at the start either and perhaps launching as <em>yet-another</em> Battle Royale was a poor choice too.</p>
<p>So now they're "going back to beta" and will be "heads down until early next year" as they rebuild the game to try and pull players back in. They said this includes "reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16732194301753210592gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's a tough time to be a game developer, especially so if you're insane enough to launch a multiplayer-only title. You're competing against some of the most-played and most-popular games in history. You have to be nuts. 1047 Games better have a good plan for the next attempt, or it could end up being another expensive mistake and the last one for the studio, there's only so many times you can screw-up.</p>
<p>I'm not holding out hope on this one. That said, I do hope they come back stronger with a decent plan, because the basics of it on paper are good, and the original Splitgate at the start was a lot of fun. It has everything that <em>should</em> make for a good game, they just have to get it all together.</p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next has released into Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Descenders Next is a fresh extreme sports game from RageSquid / No More Robots and it shadow-dropped on Steam in Early Access. They must be crazy, with little to no build up, the game just sneakily arrived along with an update to the original Descenders to add in a racing mode.</p>
<p>You have be pretty wildly confident in your game to just release it like this, especially after it was delayed previously. The publisher did send over a key, and it has been running beautifully on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4. It's also rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fE11hzKkErQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cbdd447d2453c818e2b86d047305243d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fE11hzKkErQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The publisher noted that while it's starting off with snowboarding and mountainboarding their aim is for it to "become the only extreme sports game you'll ever need, slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time". It's a pretty crazy goal to have but I appreciate it, we've needed something to come along to provide just good old-fashioned crazy sports like this that other bigger publishers rarely do.</p>
<p>Much like the original Descenders, it's going to change a lot during Early Access and so true thoughts on it will be reserved for the big 1.0 release which isn't for another two years or so. They told me it "already features as much content as the original Descenders", I can't say if that's true or not as I haven't yet had enough time with it - but there is quite a lot there already.</p>
<p>If you played the original Descenders, you'll know what to expect here. It feels very similar in the actual mechanics of the sports on the controls, which isn't surprising of course since this builds on top of what they created with the original. However, each sport that's included feels just about different enough to make it worth playing through each of them.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">What they have here currently is a wonderful base package to build upon, one that's already a <em>lot</em> of fun. I really enjoy the way you progress through it! With you picking a sport and then you're given a overworld map with various nodes on it like some sort of roguelike, instead of just a basic level list. Gives a really different feeling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15271420661753192714gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You get to pick which way you go, with each node giving a different set of tricks you need to pull off in a new environment. There's no real strategy to what you're picking here, as you don't really know what you're going to get apart from the points on the level steepness, curves and stunts.</p>
<p>You have a limited "health" stat to get through a single run, with each time you bail reducing it by one but successfully pulling off the needed tricks in each node will help you increase it. A really interesting choice for how they keep it feeling different and fresh on each run. Plus there's also the big main areas you can just ride around to pull of some tricks to practice too.</p>
<p>The insane speed you can get on some of the courses really gets your heart pumping, as you attempt another death-defying trick and then face-plant the floor. I think the biggest problem is the speed right now, a lot of the time it feels just a bit <em>too</em> fast, it's as if you have a rocket strapped to you. I think if they reduced the feel of the speed a bit, to give just a little more reaction time or more control on your descent it would be more enjoyable.</p>
<p>So far, a great start with obvious rough edges and plenty of room to grow. A much needed injection into the extreme sports genre.</p>

      <title>Hellraiser game announced with Clive Barker&#39;s Hellraiser: Revival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first proper Hellraiser game has just been revealed with Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival. Looks like it will be a good one for fans of classic horror blended with modern game design.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience a new chapter in the legendary horror series like never before. <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em> takes first-person action horror survival to the next level.</p>
<p>Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box – the Genesis Configuration – to help his girlfriend Sunny’s escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E_4kAp6gsZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d33d1052dfd3a4936b92cb514c468bbd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release Clive Barker, creator of the Hellraiser franchise, said: "Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings. The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation".</p>
<p>"Hellraiser is the quintessential horror franchise, and lends itself perfectly to a video game," said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. "Saber has had success with horror IPs in the past, and working alongside Clive to create tense gameplay and a new story that delves into the twisted depths of pain and pleasure has been a real treat. We look forward to opening up the gates of hell."</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that actor Doug Bradley will return to voice Pinhead in the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New Story in Hellraiser's Canon</strong> – Unwittingly kickstart Pinhead’s ritual to unleash greater pain and pleasure than ever before.</li>
<li><strong>Harness the Power of the Box</strong> – Combine the unique, hellish abilities of the Configuration with an arsenal of earthly weapons to inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain - or is it pleasure? - upon masochistic enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Fight Against Unholy Enemies</strong> – Take on hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and even its most infernal priests in a story-driven horror survival game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will this be one you're going to be picking up? I'm really surprised we haven't seen something like this before for the Hellraiser universe but it sounds like horror fans are in for a real treat.</p>

      <title>Co-op climbing game PEAK is a truly great time with friends</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PEAK is another in the list of quality co-op chaos games to add to your collection. From Landfall and AGGRO CRAB, it's an online co-op climbing game with some floaty silly physics and currently one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16959092611753186281gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16959092611753186281gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18557220931753186282gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18557220931753186282gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We've seen a fair amount of cheap and janky chaotic online co-op games releasing over the last year, and this just might be one of the best. I picked up a personal copy recently to add to my list next to R.E.P.O to play with a few friends, and we've ended up really loving the experience. Good for a somewhat younger audience too (teens+) I would say, as I've also been playing it a fair bit with my own smaller human who has also been thoroughly enjoying it with me.</p>
<p>So what's it all about? Climbing. Obviously. You and friends go and board a plane, which unfortunately crashes leaving you all stranded. So you've got nothing to do but recover some luggage and climb.</p>
<p>But it's also a lot more than that. It's about the power of friendship to help each other laugh and struggle through it because it is a real challenge. To help you climb ever-higher through different biomes, there's lots of items to find in all that luggage scattered across the map. From bottles of water to really stupid items, there's a lot of ways to approach how you're going to attempt to reach the peak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6850057311753186283gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6850057311753186283gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/866843061753186283gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/866843061753186283gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's different types of luggage to find from standard boxes to open that may have some food, rope, a rope cannon and other items to ancient luggage that will contain all sorts of weird treats.</p>
<p>What's really just generally clever about it is how mechanically simple it actually is as a whole. There's not a lot of gameplay elements to it, but the developers have really maximised what they're doing with it. The generation of the island is also one that will keep it feeling fresh for a long time, as you get an entirely new place to climb every 24 hours.</p>
<p>As you progress you'll also earn badges depending on how far you get, or what you manage to discover. These badges then unlock new cosmetics for you to customise your climber and you can make your character look pretty hilarious with the facial features.</p>
<p>One especially interesting feature that's really core to the gameplay is the stamina bar. If you've played the newer open-world Zelda games, you'll be familiar with it. Climbing reduces your stamina the longer you go, until you eventually fall. However, here it's also combined with the health system into one single bar. This bar fills up with hunger, weight from carrying items, poison, sleepiness and more to reduce your overall stamina. But you can fill it back up with various items you find. So it's a constant tossup between using different items at different times to maximise that stamina.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13464666281753186284gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13464666281753186284gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12710303441753186285gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12710303441753186285gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I mentioned this whole power of friendship thing, which is where the fun really begins. Each of you will have a different amount of max stamina depending on your current status, so all those items will come in use. One with more stamina can climb higher and set down a rope for others, or stand at the top to grab you before you fall. Or, be incredibly unhelpful like me and accidentally push people off — woops.</p>
<p>Even with the hours we've played, I still feel like we're only scratching the surface and the developers keep expanding it too with plans for even more to content to come.</p>
<p>You don't actually <em>need</em> friends to play it though, you can climb through it entirely solo, although it's far more interesting to play with others.</p>
<p>It works great on Desktop Linux with Proton, although the controller support is a bit odd at times. Other than that, one of the easiest recommendations I've ever made. Really entertaining.</p>

If you tried the demo previously, they said there's a lot of new things to discover in it. There's also improved gamepad support, a new photo mode, new cosmetics, new conversations and lots more. Progress will also now carry over to the full game which still does not have a confirmed release date yet.</p>
<p>In the demo you can "Fly at your own pace, trade over 200 items between five different towns, upgrade and customise your airship, discover landmarks, find random events, and much more".</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress gets much more powerful modding in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't wait to see what the community cooks up for Dwarf Fortress, with the latest update bringing much more advanced modding capabilities to the game.</p>
<p>While the old way of modding the game will still work, this new way brings a lot more options. The new system uses Lua, with a lot of previously hard-coded options now open for modders to do whatever they like. There's a lot that's open for it including inorganic materials, languages, creatures, interactions, various items, reactions, entities, and plants. The developers said this update also acts as the foundation for the upcoming "procedural magic system which will be added to all modes".</p>
<p>You can see their original video announcing the new modding capabilities from when it went into experimental testing below:</p>

<p>There was also recently another developer update video going over all the work going into the game:</p>

      <title>Valve restores the Steam page for Old School Rally after it got hit with a DMCA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/old-school-rally-gets-hit-with-a-dmca-and-taken-down-from-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently receiving a DMCA takedown notice</a>, Old School Rally had its Steam store page removed. Valve have now restored it and work on it continues.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2824660/view/515216044012341117" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said "We’re happy to share that after a thorough review by Valve's DMCA team, Old School Rally is now back online!" and that "The development team has been hard at work behind the scenes, already replacing two of the affected models, with three more set to return within the next 24 hours. We aim to bring all the missing cars back into the game with entirely new, original models over the next 3–4 weeks, minimizing disruptions to the rally experience".</p>

<p>Nice to see the situation has been resolved. An annoying and messy situation for all involved from the developer to gamers interested in picking it up. </p>

      <title>Build up a shop and make potions in the cute Penny for Your Potion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Penny for Your Potion looks like a nice one for fans of casual crafting and management, with you running your own shop and brewing potions for customers. It's due to arrive in Early Access with Linux support later this year.</p>
<p>More about it: "Penny for Your Potion is a medieval potion shop management game where you build, maintain and run your own potion shop! Organise your shop, harvest ingredients and brew powerful potions, and you'll be ready to welcome your first customers! Pay attention to what they want, keep them happy, build your reputation and unlock exciting ways to expand. Stay committed to building your shop, and your business will flourish in no time."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qx1l4HG1dfY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44ea83a54ced3c62430215fe300147e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qx1l4HG1dfY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive alchemy shop management.</li>
<li>Customising your own shop.</li>
<li>Managing your garden.</li>
<li>Brewing potions for your customers.</li>
<li>Levelling system and skill tree.</li>
<li>Compete against a greedy old fellow shopkeeper.</li>
<li>Intriguing story including the lives of townfolks and heroes.</li>
<li>Soundtrack featuring medieval tunes.</li>
<li>20-30 hours of playtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like even though it's entering Early Access, that a lot of it is already complete so they'll be using that extra time to polish it up and ensure it has a proper ending.</p>

      <title>Fallout: Bakersfield looks like an awesome Doom total conversion with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with GZDoom, a fresh teaser for Fallout: Bakersfield has been released and now I'm excited all over again for it. Previously it had a teaser back in September 2022 which was a brief 55 seconds.</p>
<p>The new trailer is over 4 minutes long and notes it's a "'non-commercial 1993' Doom total conversion (GZDoom WAD)" in the description. The developer also gives special thanks to Dave Oshry, CEO of New Blood Interactive.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6e8WrmOibpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/acea239ab911715d9e18717f2d2e498d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No word on a release date, as the trailer has a release date bit at the end that quickly flickers from 2027 and 2025 and then flickers about again. So we really have no clue right now. Overall the trailer suggests it's about 60% done, so clearly a while away yet.</p>
<p>Modders will stop at nothing to make the most crazy things in GZDoom and I love it. Should hopefully be easy enough to get it working on Linux thanks to GZDoom's excellent cross-platform support.</p>

      <title>Mycopunk is a seriously bizarre co-op shooter and a new favourite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pure chaos, that's what Mycopunk is. It's exceptionally bizarre and now my new favourite first-person shooter because it's so wildly unique. <em>Note: key provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I was already quite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fight-off-a-planet-wide-fungal-catastrophe-in-the-upcoming-co-op-shooter-mycopunk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impressed with the demo</a> and now after playing more, I'm hooked. It's very much a wonderful combination of elements from the likes of Risk of Rain 2 for the ongoing chaos during missions and Deep Rock Galactic for the structure of it only with the weirdness turned up to maximum level.</p>
<p>You pick a character class, and then go solo or team up with others across various different types of missions in various biomes across a planet. Missions can range from simply crushing as many enemies as possible, to building pipes across the map to connect points up and all sorts in between.</p>
<p>The different classes you get are quite fun but it's the enemy variation that really makes this completely nuts. Enemies are constructed of various parts you blow up and they fall apart, but other enemies might pick up their parts and attach it to themselves. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cR6nCcCi01g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb7840d282ef0d12a685a1267b5f5c62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cR6nCcCi01g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Half the time I don't entirely know exactly what's going on, because it really does just turn into pure explosive chaos. You have enemies appearing from everywhere, and some of them are massive freakish creations that fire all sorts of weapons at you. Some can be destroyed from afar, some need you to get up-close and personal. So it's good you have your own varied arsenal of weapons too.</p>
<p>There's lots of different weapons but you also get a customisation system. As you level up your character and weapons individually, you get access to various upgrade modules. You can place lots of them on your weapons in a no limits grid-based system, so as long as they fit together you can use them. It makes creating a build very unique with each player potentially being very different even when playing as the same class.</p>
<p>Quite funny that downed team mates need you to piece them back together, as you run from their legs to their torso to bring them back into the game. This will happen a lot if you're on my team, because friendly fire is most definitely a thing here. And with all the action going on, it's a bit too easy to annihilate your friends (sorry!).</p>
<p>Fantastic atmosphere too. The visual style in especially odd but in a good way it all fits together, and it definitely leans into the comedy side of things with some of the interactions and voice-over.</p>
<p>Mycopunk works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable, the only issue being noted is you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so everything is subject to change and more content is to come, but what's there right now is already a huge amount of fun and an easy recommendation from me. A great choice to run around in with a couple of friends.</p>

      <title>Xenopurge has a great concept and a good start for a tense tactical auto-battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Xenopurge puts you in the command chair overseeing marines running around various buildings, as you take down the alien threat. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you're not running around with them and you don't directly control them. Instead, you watch on your screen as they engage in the mission automatically, with you being able to give out various orders to redirect them. It's a clever and interesting concept, which is clearly inspired by the Aliens film series and the gameplay style is a bit reminiscent of Duskers.</p>
<p>You start off by picking a squad, and the select to go through various missions on a node-based map. A map type you may be familiar with from the likes of FTL and Slay the Spire. Each node being a different type of encounter from exploring and fighting aliens to upgrading your marines.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jtVVq-V9Vso"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2021ecdbd1c846c80d47bcfe96fb0316.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jtVVq-V9Vso" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's surprising just how tense it can become as you progress through it. Especially once you got a few upgrades going, you really don't want to watch your marines fall to the aliens. Hearing their remarks over voice comms really brings it all to life. Especially so, since all you can do is watch, issue orders and basically hope for the best. </p>
<p>Personally, I found the gameplay loop quite satisfying but due to the graphical style it clearly won't be for everyone. It's quite simplistic but in a way I still found to be rather engaging. It's funny how quickly I sit up in my chair as soon as a red dot appears while my marines are off exploring.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With it now in Early Access its journey has only just begun, and I hope to see a lot more from this one. They've said the current focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Steam Deck Compatibility</li>
<li>Optimisation</li>
<li>Accessibility options and Settings(Screen effects, Resolutions etc)</li>
<li>Keybindings</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Save</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical game with Sci-fi horror / tension: </strong>A tense, squad-based tactical where you’re leading your troops to hunt and exterminate alien threats in the depths of space. Inspired by the likes of Alien &amp; Space Hulk.</li>
<li><strong>Recruit and equip your squadron: </strong>Through the progression of the mission, take the opportunity to recruit new members and equip them to create a team that matches your command style.</li>
<li><strong>Quick, Engaging Sessions – Playable in Short Bursts: </strong>Designed for fast, intense tactical runs, Xenopurge allows players to jump in and complete a mission in around 20 minutes. This makes it easy to pick up and play, whether you have time for a single mission or an extended session.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible Controls: </strong>Designed to be as intuitive and accessible as possible, with the options to use keyboard, controller or mouse input. Remains smooth and responsive with simple, readable UI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Xenopurge is built around the fantasy of being inside a command room — directing missions, adapting to unpredictable dangers, and feeling the weight of every decision," said Michalis Papagathangelou, designer at Traptics. "Our goal is to simulate that experience as closely and accurately as possible. Launching into Early Access allows us to collaborate directly with our community and evolve the game together."</p>
<p>It runs to perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>Space Drilling Station looks fun for building and automation fans - with a new Steam Deck compatible demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Drilling Station has you manage and automate a drilling station on a distant planet. The developer detailed their Steam Deck work with a new demo.</p>
<p>My first time hearing about this one when finding it today. Here you build your station by making very careful use of space with vertical building. Not only are you building up a facility and automating things, but you also need to address the needs of all your people too.</p>
<p>You'll be dealing with assigning roles to all your workers to achieve the best efficiency, keeping an eye on their health and wellbeing and sorting out various production lines through your big tower. Check out the first trailer below:</p>

<p>The developer wrote a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2134850/announcements/detail/542237641778659375" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> announcing they've managed to get the first playable demo working well even on a Steam Deck, after the developer noted they received one as a gift and dedicated to get it fully working. Part of their work was ensuring the controls for such a game weren't overwhelming, along with sorting out performance issues and making sure text on the smaller screen was readable.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>🎮 Controls: Less Is More!</h4>
<p>At first, I wanted to use all of the Steam Deck's options: trackpads, joysticks, buttons... I thought it was awesome to exploit every possibility. Except, when playing, I quickly realized it was anything but pleasant. My "lazy" side took over, and I got tired of juggling between trackpads and joysticks. So I radically simplified: goodbye trackpads! I streamlined the controls to use only the bare minimum, making the experience much smoother and more intuitive.</p>
<h4>📉 The Performance Wall: Chasing Milliseconds!</h4>
<p>Once the controls were set, I hit the performance wall head-on. I knew my game wasn't an optimization champion, but on the Steam Deck, it was a disaster! I spent a good week tracking every millisecond, juggling parameters to find the right balance between fluidity and visual quality, and most importantly, to avoid draining the battery in less than 30 minutes. A real headache!</p>
<h4>📜 The "Verified" Holy Grail: Valve's Requirements</h4>
<p>Valve has very strict guidelines for the "Verified" badge. I had to face two big challenges: making all text readable from 30 cm away (you almost needed a magnifying glass before!) and removing all mentions of a mouse or keyboard. That meant redoing all the in-game videos and explanations so they were perfectly adapted to the Steam Deck. A huge amount of work!</p>
<h4>🙏 A Month Later, Pride!</h4>
<p>More than a month after receiving my Steam Deck, I'm incredibly proud to have managed to solve all the issues. It's immense satisfaction to see <strong>Space Drilling Station</strong> come to life on this machine.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it compatible. Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback; it's essential for continuing to improve the game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right onto my personal wishlist it goes.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t have time for Total War and Crusader Kings? Try the new Bellfortis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bellfortis is a medieval turn-based strategy game for players who love the genre, but don't have as much time to commit their lives to it.</p>
<p>The developer told me they were directly inspired by the likes of Total War, Centurion, or Crusader Kings 3. Giving you a chance to become a conqueror and build up a new empire, but it won't take you an entire age to finish a game with its faster gameplay. Good for those of you with busy families!</p>
<p>The game features 7 large scenarios, which can be conquered by up to 18 different factions from 9th and 10th century Europe and North Africa. Each campaign can be completed in 2 to 5 hours. In addition to the campaign, you can also play standalone battles, which are scored and timed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EBo3QjqTwP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b416257c1cd5a2961ba37d108d739049.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EBo3QjqTwP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer sent over a key to GamingOnLinux and it appears to work perfectly with Proton 9.0-4, just hit Play in Steam and away you go. Created by developer Rake in Grass, one of the oldest "garage" dev teams from the Czech Republic. They've released more than 20 games across 8 platforms, including the popular Rampage Knights and Jets'n'Guns series.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build your empire.</li>
<li>Recruit armies and fight exciting battles.</li>
<li>Play as 18 different factions across 7 unique scenarios.</li>
<li>Use politics and intrigue, diplomats and spies.</li>
<li>Face random events that can change the gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>There&#39;s now an unofficial GUI for Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keeping up with the excitement about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scalings-frame-generation-for-linux-gets-upgraded-to-the-latest-v3-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation on Linux</a> with the lsfg-vk project, there's now an extra unofficial GUI app.</p>
<p>It's quickly getting easier to install and set it all up, with the lsfg-vk project now having a much easier install ready for various Linux distributions too.</p>
<p>We already had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scaling-frame-gen-gets-a-decky-loader-steam-deck-plugin-but-theres-drama/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck</a> to make it easier, although that came with a bit of (now solved) drama attached. And now for Desktop Linux users who want to try it out and don't want to keep diving into a text config file, you can try the new lsfg-vk-ui project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20631792331753092971gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20631792331753092971gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Check out lsfg-vk-ui on <a href="https://github.com/Caliel666/lsfg-vk-ui" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Give it another month, and the project as a whole will probably be even easier again. Still far from ready for beginners, as you still need to know what you're doing.</p>

      <title>GeForce Infinity is a new app for GeForce NOW on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GeForce Infinity was announced recently as another option for running GeForce NOW on Desktop Linux, since NVIDIA haven't put out an official app.</p>
<p>While NVIDIA do have an official app for Steam Deck, we're currently missing all the extra options and better quality streaming on Desktop Linux. GeForce Infinity is not from NVIDIA directly but made by the community. It's also not the first of its kind, there's also GeForce NOW Electron that's been going for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13793394291753091116gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the GitHub the current features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced UI</strong>: GeForce Infinity aims to improve the user interface of GeForce NOW, providing a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Discord Rich Presence</strong>: Show off your gaming status with personalized Discord Rich Presence. Display game details and status updates directly in your Discord profile.</li>
<li><strong>Instant App Switch</strong>: Automatically switch to GeForce Infinity once your gaming rig is ready for action!</li>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Get notified once your gaming rig is ready for action!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also planning to add Discord Rich Presence, account switching and automatic game startup options.</p>
<p>It still has the issues other apps and using GeForce NOW in the browser have, with the options for quality and resolution being limited because NVIDIA don't support a lot of it on Desktop Linux even if you have their highest subscription.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta upgrades the in-game performance monitor for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-gets-a-new-steam-deck-like-performance-monitor-now-in-beta-replacing-the-fps-counter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in June</a>, Valve revealed the new performance monitor for the in-game Steam overlay, and now the Linux version has been upgraded.</p>
<p>Initially, only Windows had all the extra options with Linux stuck with just FPS details. Now we get all the extras too as of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545615175941619843?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">July 17th</a> Steam Beta, as long as you have an AMD or NVIDIA GPU. You can select between seeing just FPS value, FPS details, FPS details with CPU and GPU utilisation and then a further option to get everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7456466821753088098gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7456466821753088098gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The screenshot above (click it to enlarge) shows Cyberpunk 2077 on Linux with the new Steam performance monitor (top left), with the most detailed option picked.</p>
<p>While it's good to have options, and this is better than just the FPS value that the in-game overlay had, you can still get far <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more customization on Linux with MangoHud</a>.</p>
<p>The full changes from the Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added a notification for when a trade is reversed via Trade Protection</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with deleting screenshots from the focused screenshot view briefly showing an error and potentially navigating the user away from their screenshots</li>
<li>Fixed minimum and maximum client window size not updating in some situations.</li>
<li>Fixed friends list window remaining open in Steam overlay when switching between desktop and Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed modal dialogs opening behind the window displaying them.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed gamepad input for browser-based games on Windows</li>
<li>Added support for the PDP REALMz Wireless Controller for Switch</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where editing commands on an input bound to a modeshift could duplicate bindings</li>
<li>No longer open Big Picture Mode on Guide button press when guide button chording is disabled in controller settings</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the player pausing when seeking near the end of a game recording or clip</li>
</ul>
<strong>macOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed input on some web views working incorrectly after page loads causing effects like input cursor not displaying and payment dropdown during checkout continuing to have focus after selecting an option.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabled advanced options for the in-game performance overlay for AMD and Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case where the Big Picture update progress UI would disappear.</li>
</ul>

      <title>According to one source Linux hits over 6% desktop user share</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on where you look, Linux on the desktop has somewhere between 4-6% user share on the desktop. Showing it's growing slowly but steadily overall.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to look at Statcounter, which we've covered here at GamingOnLinux quite a few times which currently showings Linux on the desktop at about 4.1% for June 2025 globally. However, there's another pretty big source of data we can use for checking on this – the US government.</p>
<p>Using the US government <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public data</a>, we can see that over the last 30 days the Linux user share hit an all-time high there at 6.1%. Pretty healthy looking percentage there, and if we filter it to the current calendar year overall it's at 5.8%. That's a surprisingly high number, given their data mentions how they've had "1.48 billion sessions in the last 30 days" to pull the data from.</p>
<p>Going back to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> and filtering to the US, it's also showing an all-time high for Linux at 5.1% too. And then there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, showing Linux for gaming has been steadily trending upwards too.</p>
<p>We've all seen the running joke of the "Year of the Linux desktop", and while most celebrations on it are rather premature, we've truly over the last year or two seen quite a seismic shift in how people have been looking at Linux. Not just from data points like these, but the wider consensus when you look at how even bigger influencers have been pouring more time into covering Linux too (and their videos doing well). Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PewDiePie</a> with 110M subscribers telling people to now install Linux, or how about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa8nMiEoti0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">JayzTwoCents</a> too and various others.</p>
<p>Seems like there's never been a better time to try out Linux on the desktop.</p>

      <title>Next-generation brick building sandbox Brickadia is out with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roblox? LEGO? Who needs it. I'm all about Brickadia life now. Out in Early Access, it's a next-generation mixture of LEGO styled block building, a little of Garry's Mod too perhaps and Roblox style mini-games.</p>
<p>A dynamic sandbox where your imagination is (sometimes) the limit, game features allowing of course. There's already a lot you can do with it too with real-time co-op building all directly in-game with no external editors needed. This includes fully functioning vehicles, a wiring system and big open-world environments.</p>
<p>While I was in the middle of writing this up as I previously spoke to the developer and they provided a key, another email entered the GamingOnLinux inbox today and they certainly knew how to get my attention. With a title starting "*LINUX PLAYERS!*" — okay, you got me.</p>
<p>In the email they noted "Brickadia is fully playable on Steam Deck with great performance, and works nicely on other desktops through Proton. The studio is working on being listed as Verified for the Steam Deck. A Linux dedicated server is also available". True to their word, it works great with Proton 9.0-4 on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>See, it doesn't take much. While the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox continue to just block Linux platforms</a> along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">various other games with anti-cheat</a>, perhaps something like Brickadia could eventually take its place. Once it's further along of course, there's a lot of work ahead of it that the developers are aware they need to either fix, improve or expand upon.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights the developers noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unleash Your Creativity: Build absolutely anything you can imagine with a powerful, intuitive building system that handles millions of bricks effortlessly. Any brick can be turned into a physics object using the Selector tool.</li>
<li>Build Together, Live: No need for external editors, everything is done in-game. Modify the world in real-time alongside friends, enabling seamless creative collaboration in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Play Your Way: From high-intensity combat gamemodes to laid-back social servers for building and hanging out, Brickadia supports a wide range of play styles.</li>
<li>Vehicle Creation: Design and build your own cars out of bricks, complete with engines, seats, and a variety of wheels to choose from.</li>
<li>Build Boats and Ships: Construct floating vehicles with buoyancy physics, engine bricks, and seats perfect for exploring or racing on water.</li>
<li>Bring Builds to Life with Wires: Use a powerful wiring system to make your creations interactive. With an easy-to-use wiring tool and a wide range of functional gates and components, complex logic is at your fingertips</li>
<li>Advanced Mechanics: Combine physics joints with wire circuits to build intricate, functional machines using an advanced physics engine.</li>
<li>Explore and Share with the Gallery: Instantly access massive player-made worlds and a huge collection of community-built prefabs through the in-game Gallery.</li>
<li>Dynamic Worlds: A fully customizable environment system lets you control stunning visuals and weather effects, with real volumetric clouds!</li>
<li>Lighting That Pops: Add dynamic lights to bricks to enhance the look and feel of your builds with gorgeous detail.</li>
<li>Immersive Audio: Integrate ambient sounds and custom effects into your creations using versatile audio components.</li>
<li>Next-Gen Visuals: Enjoy breathtaking graphics powered by HDR and ray tracing, making your worlds and creations look better than ever.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It is impressive though. Not only does it look great but it performs well too and I do love how accessible it all is to get going, it's really very inviting. This could end up being a great one for all audiences of all ages. There's some clever tools it gives you too that will no doubt be an absolute dream for LEGO building enthusiasts. Being able to warp blocks in various directions, copy and paste and more — there's so much to like about it.</p>
<p>Early indicators are that players have been enjoying it, with a Very Positive rating on Steam. However, games like this that entirely rely on a community can live and die rather quickly, it's a risky bet for game devs. We've seen lots and lots and lots more fail when they can't keep a player count so it will be interesting to see if they manage to do so. It's a tough world out there in game dev land. I'm hoping for the best on this one.</p>

      <title>Kaizen: A Factory Story is a great return from the Zachtronics team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reformed under the new studio Coincidence, the team from Zachtronics have now released Kaizen: A Factory Story with Linux / SteamOS support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. <em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>One of my favourite automation games is actually from Zachtronics, where I was completely captivated by Opus Magnum when it released back in 2017. And of course, because it's <s>Zachtronics</s>, uh - Coincidence, it comes complete with another solitaire game but this time with a pachinko theme to it. Nice to see them return to their roots a bit more with this one.</p>
<p>So what is it? Well, you might think you know what to expect from an automation puzzle game like it but it will surprise you a bit. Especially the visual novel styled intro, where you have to do a little musical rhythm game that I failed <em>miserably</em> at but it didn't seem to cause any problems. I just wasn't prepared for mashing a few keys like it when going in. You got me there, Coincidence. </p>
<p>For the main part of the game once you get into it your goal is to design production lines to create specific products. You get given a bunch of parts, and then it's up to you how they all fit together to make whatever retro product it is that you're tasked with. What you do is drag and drop pieces of the product around, and then the parts of the factory machines you're going to use onto a board, do a little simple code-block programming and see if it all comes together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2450833791752840064gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2450833791752840064gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If it doesn't, move all the pieces around until it will. Using a mixture of welders, arms that push things around and more eventually you'll have lots of moving parts that becomes a joy to watch.</p>
<p>In between you get more little visual novel bits diving into the expanding story of how you, David, were really not meant to be building things in a factory.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ib8YhZSgb_s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ee58aa00b0af3a26f62c3679835bebb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ib8YhZSgb_s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared with other similar games from the developers formerly at Zachtronics, it feels a lot less complicated. It's much more inviting and feels a lot more like you're slotting puzzle pieces together with a little automation flair. Still quite puzzling at times though, a few of them really left me scratching my head for a while. The inviting nature of it can certainly hide the challenge.</p>
<p>If you like the sound of some puzzling automation wrapped up in a retro 1980s Japanese theme, it's one for you. It's not perfect though, as story-telling clearly still isn't a strong point for the developers with nothing about the story and dialogue being at all interesting or noteworthy, it's just kind of…there. It breaks up the building a little, but that's exactly why we're all here. Other than that, it still makes me feel like a tiny genius when I solve the later levels so i did really enjoy it.</p>

      <title>If you love Brotato you should check out Noobs Are Coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noobs Are Coming is a new release that takes the skin of Brotato and puts you in the shoes of a final boss, complete with really weird abilities. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The developer said they were directly inspired by Brotato and The Binding of Isaac, which you can tell within a few seconds based on the gameplay and some of the visual style. It's an arena-based top-down rogue-lite shooter, where you pick a boss and go through rounds where you get more and more powerful. </p>
<p>You likely already know the drill for these games but if not — you pick a character and some abilities, then run around a small arena fighting off waves of enemies while collecting experience points from little orbs they drop. In between waves you spend orbs to add new weapons to your arsenal, or upgrade existing weapons and add buffs to your character ready to go through the next more challenging wave.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="159Mh6z_YY0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e21a6eec8bd11c502431acc068381669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/159Mh6z_YY0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently in Early Access so it's not a finished game but what it has is good fun though, with lots of weird combinations to try out for all the characters. They're all so different which is nice, with their play-style being thoroughly unique between them on what you can pick to begin with and how you can power up during a run. Like the boss that starts with a mini-me attached to you via an umbilical cord that you can keep upgrading, or the ability to repeatedly plant an angry tomato you need to run over to water and then they will spring up and dash at enemies. It can be pretty funny in a completely ridiculous way.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how it will evolve during Early Access, as I think it still needs to pull itself apart from the Brotato roots just a little bit more.</p>
<p>Quite an early hit too with it selling over 5,000 copies in a single day. Not a lot for bigger developers but pretty great for a tiny indie with no real marketing behind it. </p>
<p>The developer mentioned they plan to add "more content, such as new playable characters, weapons, items, enemies" and they're looking into "expanding playstyle variety to deepen build options and synergies".</p>
<p>If you love fast-paced arena fights with auto-shooting like Brotato, Vampire Survivors and the like you'll probably get on quite well with this. The Native Linux version tested runs well, although the Steam Overlay didn't work with it for me.</p>

      <title>Handmade stop-motion digging adventure Mashina arrives July 31</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that made Judero, the handmade stop-motion digging adventure Mashina is set to arrive on July 31st.</p>
<p>I really love what they're doing with the art in their games, there's truly not many at all that will go to these lengths to make their games stand out in this way. Every single thing in the game is made out of various materials and animated using traditional stop-motion techniques. The gameplay looks just a weird and wacky as the art-style.</p>
<p>You play as Mashina, a friendly mining robot tasked with finding minerals to help mend, build and nurture her quirky robot community. The gameplay in Mashina is divided into two distinct sections; a deep, mysterious underground full of trinkets and minerals and a vibrant, fully explorable 3d overground.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XH2zSrOoMgY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bd3f888daf4b94d21b4a3612758938d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XH2zSrOoMgY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Stop-Motion Animation:</strong> Everything in Mashina is handmade out of various materials and animated using traditional stop-motion techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Digging / Mining:</strong> An entire under world to explore and dig around! Dig by hand, use your radar to find precious items and work your way up to a fully automated process with tools and inventions you find along the way!</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Digging up minerals, trinkets and treasures takes up a lot of space! Make sure you manage your inventory to maximize your time in the under world.</li>
<li><strong>Secret Items and Unlockables:</strong> Excavate rare minerals, find items that help you unlock new inventions and friends that will join you and help you on your adventure!</li>
<li><strong>Equipment Upgrades:</strong> Upgrade your digging and mining equipment to maximize your under world operation!</li>
<li><strong>Exploration and Base Building:</strong> Take the items you find in the under world above ground! Friends around your island help you in all sorts of ways!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous game Judero is Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB, no doubt this will work well too.</p>

      <title>2.5D turn-based strategy game Avante! Atlantis gives off Advance Wars vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avante! Atlantis is an upcoming turn-based strategy game that looks like you're playing a board game with a clever 2.5D style. The developer recently announced full Native Linux and Steam Deck support. There's a demo available right now too which they keep updating for you to get an early taste of what's to come.</p>
<p>More about it: "Amid global conflict and scarce resources, the lost city of Atlantis has mysteriously resurfaced. Rich in natural resources, it quickly becomes the focus of every major nation’s ambitions. But Atlantis didn’t return by chance. As battles rage across its ruins, a deeper mystery begins to unfold...one that could reshape the world."</p>
<p>Getting some Advance Wars vibes from this one for the mixture of the level and battle scene style, but at least unlike other very similar games to Advance Wars, the overall aesthetic is more unique.</p>
<p>Check out their original trailer below:</p>

<li>Many ways to Play!: Battle solo or compete with friends in exciting matches! Play locally or over LAN for an intense and thrilling experience. Up to 4 Players in a match!</li>
<li>Board Game Experience: Roll the dice for victory! Each roll can slightly boost or reduce your unit’s base power, adding a small layer of unpredictability to your strategy.</li>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village from Stray Fawn Studio is a really unique city-builder that takes place on the back of a giant moving creature. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>It's unlike any other village / city-builder I've played due to the way the game progresses, with you going through different locations with events. A really great idea and visually pleasing too. Nice to see it fully release now with a lot of content enhancements since the initial Early Access release. </p>
<p>As usual for a lot of games now, the 1.0 release is not the end of the road. They're working on addressing feedback and a 1.1 "Quality of Life &amp; UX update" is planned, along with a further 1.2 update to expand the interactions and relationship you have with the giant creature named Onbu.</p>
<p>For the 1.0 release they made a sweet animated trailer:</p>

      <title>Old School Rally gets hit with a DMCA and taken down from Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how tough game dev can be for smaller teams and solo devs, Old School Rally has been hit with a DMCA and the Steam store page is gone. This is hopefully only a temporary situation, while the developer of the game works through the issue.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2824660/discussions/0/590651049589629945/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> the developer noted how they sourced certain car models from Sketchfab, a website where people can share and buy 3D models. The game developer said they spoke to the original uploader to verify approval for use in the game. All of that was agreed, so the game developer continued using the models and released the game with them. Unfortunately, a week ago the game developer received a claim of ownership over the car models from someone else. The original uploader of the car models maintained they own them, and the game developer reached out to the claimant to explore solutions. Sadly, "on Monday Old School Rally was abruptly issued with a DMCA takedown notice, prompting Steam to temporarily remove the game from the store as per their policies (which is standard practice)".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So for now the game store page is just gone. The game developer is planning to update the game to lock the models and note they will return, as they're working on "all-original car model designs that still show resemblances to the classic legendary rally cars that we all love as replacements in waves".</p>
<p>What a sticky situation. Dev grabs models with the author's permission, and it turns out they might not actually own those models. Just goes to show how difficult it can be for game devs sourcing art from elsewhere. And, with the rise of AI generation, that might only get more troublesome.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 2.3 is out with new vehicles, auto drive, AMD FSR 4, Intel XeSS 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED have released the latest major free update for Cyberpunk 2077 today, bringing with it new content and graphics enhancements. It's quite a big one too, with a lot more than I expected them to add in after the last update. Nice to see them still continue to expand it though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qPcPBaWhny4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64a924f4b2cf93127f147f1ca37d22cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qPcPBaWhny4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Vehicles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:
	<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Hunt and The Beast In Me). An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</li>
<li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search and Destroy)."</li>
<li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...). If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</li>
<li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong> Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introducing AutoDrive! This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map). If you have no set destination, it will take you on a leisurely ride through the streets of Night City. Simply hop in any of your vehicles, make sure you're on a road, and hold H (PC) / Left Stick (consoles) to activate. This feature is disabled when you enter combat or when your vehicle is heavily damaged.</li>
<li>Implemented Cinematic Camera for AutoDrive. Hold Q (PC) / D-Pad Right (consoles) to activate. Sit back and enjoy cinematic views of Night City as you cruise toward your destination.</li>

<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ is now available for vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles. Additionally, the infamous hacker known as Cosmetic_Troll exploited a vulnerability and created a cracked version of Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology for lower-end vehicles. Please note, however, that some models do not support the technology, such as heavily modded nomad vehicles and job-related vehicles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color schemes did not work properly on the Mizutani Shion MZ1 and MZ2.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA 570.172.08 released for Linux as the main stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA are continuing to make us guess what's included in their updates with the NVIDIA driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/249205/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.172.08</a> release today.</p>
<p>This is part of their Recommended/Certified driver series, their main stable series that updates a bit slower with new features compared with the New Feature Branch. Much like NVIDIA did with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent driver 575.64.03 release</a>, they're being rather vague as they channel mobile app store changelog energy with this.</p>
<p>The entire changelog is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. And unlike the 575.64.03 release, they haven't stealthily added RTX 5050 support to it as that's not currently listed in the supported products for this driver.</p>
<p>At this point I can only speculate, as it's not even listed yet on the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub to sleuth through. Perhaps we <em>might</em> see some more security issues get revealed in a few weeks / month, which would make some sense on why they're being repeatedly vague with these latest two driver updates as to not give anything away but get people updated and prepared. Potentially related to <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5671" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rowhammer</a> that they recently put up a security bulletin on. It could also be nothing of the sort - we just don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Update at 16:50 UTC</strong> - now that it's actually up on the open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub, we <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/commit/4d6c416e7fd20dba9b24e6b1d352284473af7812" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">can see</a> they did in fact tag RTX 5050 as supported with this release, despite the models missing from the driver update page.</p>
<p><em>I've emailed NVIDIA this time to see if we can get some clearer details.</em></p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is set to arrive sometime soon, and they've ensured it works well on Steam Deck as it's Verified ahead of release. They're not giving the release date out for Early Access yet, but the publisher has already sent a key for GamingOnLinux testing.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's time to conquer the world of extreme sports. This is Descenders Next. Grab your snowboard and tackle the steep, snowy slopes, or tear up the harsh, lush terrain with your mountainboard! Feel like taking on the challenge with a squad? Match up with your friends and Descenders players all around the world, and take on the tracks together! The mountain is calling - will you master it?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155816311752758559gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Sharing the Steam Deck news in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/535481986904490066" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said "One of the main things we wanted to make sure is that Descenders Next runs great on Steam Deck, so we're super glad we can give you the ultimate experience!". The status isn't live yet, but developers do get notified before the Steam Deck notice goes live.</p>
<p>It was originally due to launch April 9th, but it was delayed in March to give it a little more time to cook. During Early Access they plan to add in more sports, more game modes - more everything.</p>
<p>They have more news to come on Descenders Day, July 21st.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is a free and open source RTS game that saw a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/open-source-rts-0-a-d-alpha-27-released-bringing-a-new-vulkan-renderer-new-maps-amd-fsr-and-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first release in years back in January</a>, now an important bug fix patch is out now. This aims to clean up the most pressing issues, as part of their new workflow to get releases out much quicker.</p>

<p>See the previous update trailer for some footage on it:</p>

      <title>felix86 emulator for Linux for x86 and x86-64 apps on RISC-V can now run Steam and major games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can now play some major games on RISC-V systems running Linux, thanks to the felix86 emulator that's really coming along. <em>I covered the felix86 project initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/felix86-is-a-new-open-source-linux-emulator-to-run-x86-64-linux-programs-on-risc-v-processors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in May</a>.</em></p>
<p>With RISC-V slowly and steadily growing in the background, it's great to see projects like this for gaming on more hardware. One of the developers emailed in to note they've "made quite a bit of progress since May" and that "Now, felix86 can run Windows titles like Crysis and Witcher 3 on RISC-V". Additionally, "we even got the Linux Steam client working, which means games that have Steam DRM can be played on RISC-V with felix86".</p>
<p>They sent along a screenshot of Steam running on their RISC-V board too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14847659061752748516gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14847659061752748516gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The latest release from June 30th implemented a lot of what was missing to get to this stage, which they covered in a fresh <a href="https://felix86.com/AAA-Games/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Amazing work by all the developers involved.</p>

      <title>Make-A-Wish UK launches the Wish 200 Week Charity Sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Help make some dreams come true for critically ill children in the Wish 200 Week Charity Sale that's now live on Steam.</p>
<p>During this event a bunch of games are going on sale, with each game donating a percentage of sales to Make-A-Wish UK. Your chance to grab some new games and feel good about it at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19443750341752748038gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release, Jason Suckley, Chief Executive of Make-A-Wish UK says: ​ </p>
<p>"We’re thrilled to see the Wish 200 Week campaign return in 2025 for its fifth year. One of the highlights is the Make-A-Wish UK Charity Sale, which will directly support in helping to make more life-changing wishes come true. </p>
<p>For many critically ill children, gaming is a lifeline. It provides a social outlet during long treatment cycles when they can’t attend school or clubs with friends; it offers respite and distraction from daily challenges, and it opens the door to a welcoming community where they can be themselves again. </p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible generosity of our supporters, we hope to raise vital funds that will bring hope, joy, and strength to even more children when they need it most.  </p>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped make this charity sale a reality. Thank you."</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45565804/sale/Wish200WeekCharitySale" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full charity sale on Steam</a>. It runs through July 20th.</p>

      <title>Battlesmiths: Blade &amp; Forge announced Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battlesmiths: Blade &amp; Forge is a tactical RPG where every piece of gear is forged by you, and there's also some town-building involved too.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really fun mixture of genres here and it's nice to see the developer getting dedicated Steam Deck testing in early. As they said in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2583940/view/527600687561834544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the game is a while away but "Our testing shows great results with launching and playing Battlesmiths on Steam Deck (in fact, some of our developers now prefer it to any other platform)".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N7NIzg1azVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8249d912549e25f9f1c07a7a44fa11c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N7NIzg1azVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they said "We can safely say that Battlesmiths is already fully playable on Steam Deck via the already available touch screen control options and will be compatible with Steam Deck upon Steam release".</p>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Crafting that matters</h4>
<p>In <em>Battlesmiths</em>, gear isn’t loot — it’s the result of your labor.<br/>
Weapons and armor are crafted by you and directly affect how your heroes look and fight. Add runes to weapons for powerful abilities. Enchant armor to customize your squad. Customize the appearances of every hero the way you like.</p>
<h4>Rebuild a broken town</h4>
<p>Upgrade blacksmiths, alchemists, miners and more. Each building adds new systems, from resource production to advanced gear recipes. Your town is the heart of your progress.</p>
<h4>Tactical, squad-based combat</h4>
<p>Command a team of up to four heroes in strategic semi-auto battles.<br/>
Choose gear carefully: classes are defined by weapon types, and every loadout impacts movement, damage, and attack speed.</p>
<h4>Multiple game modes</h4>
<p>Whether you love PvE or PvP, there’s always something to conquer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: story-driven solo missions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arena</strong>: fight other players and prove you're the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labyrinth</strong>: test your build in a brutal survival mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tower of Trials</strong>: scaling challenges with high rewards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clan boss</strong>: cooperate to bring down a massive foe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adventure</strong>: limited-time missions and side quests</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth announced with swappable magnetic ABXY</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't need another controller, at this point I have 7 but another couldn't hurt right? The 8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth with swappable magnetic ABXY looks lovely.</p>
<p>Compatible with SteamOS / Steam Deck too, with 8BitDo saying "all of its inputs have been optimized to fully work with Steam". This has me quite excited actually. It's a fully featured controller too with a charging dock, 2.4G wireless in addition to Bluetooth, Hall Effect Triggers &amp; Mode Switching, TMR Joysticks and of course there's the fancy magnetic ABXY so you can play it in the standard or Nintendo layout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828702481752745040gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828702481752745040gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It also has extra remappable Fast Bumpers (R4 and L4 buttons) that doesn't require any software, a refined D-pad, back buttons and wear resistant joystick rings. Sounds like an excellent update over the Pro 2 Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless is my all-time favourite</a> controller but I do love the look of this.</p>
<p>It will release August 12, 2025 for the US at $69.99, but no exact date for the UK or EU yet.</p>

      <title>Umamusume: Pretty Derby now Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible and works on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another game with anti-cheat that released on Steam recently is Umamusume: Pretty Derby. Valve just rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>What is it? This Anime gacha game is all about magical girl horse racing. You recruit various characters for your team, get them training and compete in races. In between there's lots of visual-novel style animated chatter, with plenty of voice acting too. It's a thoroughly weird concept but as an Anime fan, I've seen a <em>lot</em> stranger than this. It also looks surprisingly…good?</p>
<p>Clearly popular too with a peak player count of 48,266 in the last 24 hours and a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>It uses "CrackProof" kernel-level anti-cheat so it's pleasing to see the developer Cygames, Inc. has enabled it for Linux platforms. Valve tested it with the latest stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> for their verification and the only thing holding it back from being Verified according to Valve is that some text can be a bit small on the Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p>As usual for GamingOnLinux, I like to first-hand verify everything I possibly can that I report on. And despite complete information <em>overload</em> when going through all the tutorials, it works with no problems on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17297084901752673458gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17297084901752673458gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19221286731752673459gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19221286731752673459gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Umamusume: Pretty Derby on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Testing it myself also on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 9.0-4, it also worked completely out of the box. No launch options needed, no changes to the Proton version. Just completely click and play with the defaults which is really great to see.</p>

<p>Just be aware if you decide to try it that once it's downloaded and launched, it then needs to do an additional in-game download before you can actually play it.</p>

<p>Even if this style of game is not your personal go-to, it's important to see as many of these working as possible. It only takes one or two games not working to prevent someone being comfortable using Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Nice to see more games with anti-cheat get enabled like this along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lost-ark-from-amazon-games-appears-to-have-enabled-the-anti-cheat-for-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lost Ark</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/wuthering-waves-now-steam-deck-playable-and-works-on-desktop-linux-with-one-tweak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wuthering Waves</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/blue-archive-from-nexon-arrives-on-steam-and-works-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blue Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-finals-is-getting-new-kernel-based-anti-cheat-likely-to-break-it-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Finals</a> getting confirmed to continue support.

      <title>Silence of the Siren renames to Heroes of Science and Fiction to pull in more HoMM fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Science and Fiction is the new name for Silence of the Siren from Oxymoron Games, as they try to pull in more fans of Heroes of Might and Magic. <em>The name change came along with a major update to the game.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A turn-based strategy game where several different space-faring civilisations fight over control of a distant star system. Explore what's left on the planets and secure resources to build mighty cities. Raise powerful armies and defeat your opponents on the battlefield. Overall, it's a pretty great take on modernised HoMM-styled strategy and it has a Very Positive rating from players on Steam.</p>
<p>Explaining why they changed the name they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To address the elephant in the room first though, your eyes are not misleading you - after carefully considering this step for months, we decided to change the name of the game from Silence of the Siren to the long-term working title, Heroes of Science and Fiction. You're no doubt curious why, so here are the main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was really easy to mix up the name with other games in the genre, and we saw too many cases of for example Youtubers struggling to remember the name.</li>
<li>The new name should make it much more obvious to HoMM fans that this game is in the same genre as the beloved classic, which is really important when players see it on any list on Steam and decide whether to have a closer look.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The new update includes a full Map Editor, Steam Workshop integration and quite a lot of new content. There's a whole new planet with a 6-phase day-night cycle, 7 new maps, new neutral units, a Beta version of a map generator and various smaller changes.</p>
<p>A new mini trailer was released to highlight the features in the update:</p>

      <title>Lost Ark from Amazon Games appears to have enabled the anti-cheat for Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lost Ark is a free to play MMO from Smilegate RPG and Amazon Games that was previously blocked on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck but now works.</p>
<p>Originally launched February 2022, there's been one or two times in the past where the anti-cheat very briefly let people in and then continued blocking shortly after. But not it appears it might actually be here to stay. The developer did not make any announcement on this I can find anywhere, but their Easy Anti-Cheat system appears to have been enabled for at least a full two weeks now.</p>

<em>Pictured - Lost Ark on Kubuntu 25.04</em></p>
<p>Using the current main stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>, the game was completely click and play for me. Nothing special needed, no launch options — it just worked. Nice to see another online game working on Linux platforms! Shame it took so long on this one.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Linux anti-cheat compatibility page</a> has been updated.</p>

      <title>Avowed from Obsidian and Xbox now Steam Deck Verified with Update 1.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avowed from Obsidian Entertainment / Xbox Game Studios is now fully Steam Deck Verified with the big new 1.5 update.</p>
<p>You have to hand it to games published by Xbox Game Studios (Microsoft), they've been some of the most open AAA games that have ensured they work well on Linux platforms with Proton like SteamOS. Along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gears-of-war-reloaded-is-officially-steam-deck-verified-and-steamos-compatible/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enabling anti-cheat</a> in their games too where <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many other publishers do not</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1660988641752660953gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice how being Steam Deck Verified is right at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/510711823303967381" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">list</a> of changes. Not just that though the update adds in new abilities and passives for the Ranger and Fighter, new items, there's an update to enemy combat behaviour, TAA will now actually be off if upscaling is off, there's a new 40FPS limit option (likely for Steam Deck), custom map markers were added in lots more.</p>

      <title>Blender 4.5 LTS arrives with Vulkan fully supported and lots of performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big day in Blender land with the arrival of Blender 4.5 LTS, finally bringing Vulkan up to full supported status with it matching OpenGL. This will ensure Blender can continue building up advanced graphical features with good performance.</p>
<p>Blender is easily one of the most important open source projects out there, and it's great to see more and more game devs pick it up. Along with other industries. In case you missed it the Blender Studio team recently released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/dogwalk-is-a-free-casual-game-from-the-blender-studio-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DOGWALK made with Godot</a>.</p>
<p>There's absolutely masses of new features, and plenty of features were tweaked to improve their performance for this release too. So the app should start up faster and remains smoother. A lot of UI work again went into this release to polish it up, make it more intuitive and accessible.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPhA0imjvVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b58e666bb974a42c664f898a2df05ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPhA0imjvVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Specifically on Linux they also added large cursors for hi-DPI monitors and support for the Hyper modifier key.</p>
<p>Check out all the changes on the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Blender website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam adds Trade Protected Items starting with Counter-Strike 2, along with a bit of Half-Life fan trolling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Counter-Strike 2 has begun a new season, and Valve added a new feature called Trade Protected Items and they're poking fun at Half-Life fans too.</p>
<p>Firstly the funny bit. This is <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/529852487375519751" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Season 3 of Counter-Strike 2</a>, and we all know the joke about how Valve "can't count to 3" right? How Half-Life 3 is this mythical beast that will never arrive. And, even if / when Valve do a new Half-Life many expect it not to be called Half-Life 3 just to avoid it. Well, Valve called Season 3 of Counter-Strike 2 "Season Two: Episode One" just to rub it in that little bit more.</p>
<p>A nice bit of self-awareness. Amusing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3846304721752659117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A new feature has also been added to Steam starting with Counter-Strike 2 called Trade Protected Items. Allowing you to reverse all CS2 trades from the last 7 days, which could help in the unlikely event you lose control of your Steam account or were the target of a scam.

      <title>Valve gets pressured by payment processors with a new rule for game devs and various adult games removed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17/07/25 21:44 UTC</strong> - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux with this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks. As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam.</p>
<p>We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Valve have added a new rule to the Onboarding guide for game developers, noting that payment processors get a say in what stays on Steam.</p>
<p>Recently, a number of people noticed and posted across various Reddits that PayPal has been unavailable for days, so it's possible this is all coming from PayPal but nothing has been confirmed on that.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steamworks</a> the new rule is noted under the "What you shouldn’t publish on Steam" heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SteamDB noticed this, and also noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> thread how numerous incest games had been removed:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8499127041752665425gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That's a very specific type of game removal but could only be the beginning of a wider crackdown on the types of adult content allowed on Steam.</p>
<p>Valve certainly aren't the first to have this happen. Patreon has also seen issues with payment processors like PayPal in the past with adult content. So, it's not really a surprise that this has happened, the surprise to me is that payment processors haven't come down on Valve sooner for all these types of games because they really don't like their services being used for it. It's not like Valve have a choice in this either, they could fight it but it would probably be a lot more costly than it's worth to them.</p>
<p>I've asked Valve to provide a comment and will update if they reply but it's unlikely they will in cases like this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The upcoming skate. from EA will be unsupported on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>skate. is an upcoming next-generation skateboarding game and it's now confirmed it will not support Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to anti-cheat.</p>
<p>This should perhaps be no surprise since it's an EA (Electronic Arts) published title. They've been gradually moving over older games to their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newer EA Javelin Anticheat</a> that completely blocks Linux platforms. Plus, how they also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blocked Apex Legends too</a> which uses Easy Anti-Cheat. And with skate. being an online game with no offline mode, it was a given that it would have anti-cheat and now it's fully confirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7495807271752616244gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - skate., credit: EA</em></p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3354750/view/636812613495292422" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> on Steam, these two key FAQ points should be noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How will we make sure players have all the appropriate safety/privacy controls? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At EA and Full Circle, we believe in the power of Positive Play. In skate, we want to ensure everyone has a great time, but if something goes sideways, it’s important to empower players to let us know quickly. We have EA Javelin anti-cheat monitoring for any unfair gameplay issues and in-game reporting for other issues like griefing. There are also numerous privacy options (blocking teleporting, spectating, and disabling the ability of others to move your Build Kit items).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will skate. be available for Mac OS, Steam OS, Proton/Linux systems (handle held PCs like the Steam Deck) for Early Access? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We want to bring skate. to as many platforms as possible and will continue to listen to feedback and look at the feasibility of adding new platforms in the future, but for Early Access launch, MacOS, SteamOS, Proton/Linux will not be supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really do hope Valve keep pushing SteamOS <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">so this anti-cheat problem can eventually be solved</a> as I wrote about before here on GamingOnLinux. It's such a thorn in the side of Linux gaming, one of the last true major hurdles for it to overcome.</p>
<p>At this point, it's also worth reminding people that any upcoming Windows kernel changes will mean nothing for Linux / SteamOS gaming. I wrote about it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in September 2024</a> due to various clickbait articles elsewhere. It's come up <em>again</em> recently due to another Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/26/the-windows-resiliency-initiative-building-resilience-for-a-future-ready-enterprise/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, which talks about new security solutions that work outside of the kernel (for people who don't read it - developers "can" use it, they're not being forced), but everything I wrote before remains the same. If developers want to block Linux, they will continue to do so.</p>

      <title>Popular free online shooter STRAFTAT just got a big content expansion with 4 player support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STRAFTAT is a free to play arena shooter that's quite popular, and it just had a big content expansion with support for 4 players. It has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>Originally a 1v1 frag-fest, it now supports teams along with free for all up to 4 players total. This can be a mixture of 2v2, 1v2, 1v3 and so on. While there's a lot of online shooters, STRAFTAT sets itself apart from the back-to-basics arena gameplay with each round being a completely different environment with a different set of weapons. It's complete chaos in the best of ways.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-F7PsHqJh_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d8ab54aa20d3bf523c824d016109f2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-F7PsHqJh_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Gamemodes : Teams, FFA (both : up to 4 players).</li>
<li>New lobby settings (Friendly fire, mid match joining, player outline).</li>
<li>Reworked and improved Main Menu interface.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements on Logs in killfeed.</li>
<li>Added 4 Player Spawn Points to each map.</li>
<li>Weapon Randomizer Improvements (Customize weapon pool, spawn rate…).</li>
<li>Native Map Playlists.</li>
<li>Added Speedometer (Enable in Graphics Options).</li>
<li>Map Playlists export/import (easy to share your playlists online).</li>
<li>Killcam improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair revenue model too for a free game. There's a DLC with more maps, weapons and cosmetics. The maps and weapons are enabled for any players as long as the host owns it. There's also a new supporter edition DLC with this update that adds more cosmetics.</p>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition has arrived and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition is now here from Aspyr Media, updating the classic from 2006. It arrives after multiple leaks rated by Valve as Steam Deck Verified, SteamOS Compatible and should work fine on Desktop Linux with the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Nice to see another oldie revived with a number of enhancements, but will it be enough to pull in some fresh players?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2N_7XaKuFLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/796b88cec525a9e1e2a6ec7c3536b965.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2N_7XaKuFLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gather Your Party</strong>: Assemble a team of your friends across any and all platforms with fully supported crossplay. Together, embark on an epic journey governed by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 ruleset.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Legend</strong>: Make your mark on the Realms as you play your way through over 100 hours of immersive gameplay and four unique campaigns, each as expansive as the Bag of Holding.</li>
<li><strong>Or a Dungeon Master</strong>: Bring your pen-and-paper campaign to life! Craft your own solo or multiplayer D&amp;D adventures or explore the creations of others.</li>
<li><strong>A Relic, Restored</strong>: Everything you loved about Neverwinter Nights 2 has been preserved. Enjoy smoother gameplay with refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not really nostalgic for the Neverwinter Nights series, so it's one frankly I'm skipping over entirely.</p>
<p>Are you going to be picking it up? Aspyr are doing a lot of these remasters now, so hopefully it's a good one. If not, hopefully they will get some updates out to solve any lingering issues.</p>

      <title>Wuthering Waves now Steam Deck Playable, and works on Desktop Linux with one tweak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Wuthering Waves launched on Steam, it was left broken on all Linux platforms including SteamOS and Steam Deck but now it works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/wuthering-waves-arrives-on-steam-another-with-anti-cheat-problems-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer noted on their Steam page</a> after release how they were working on it, and it seems they've recently updated their version of Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) to allow it all to work.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck / SteamOS, Valve have today <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3513350/history/?changeid=30069803" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">officially</a> bumped it up from Unsupported to Playable with Valve's testing using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>. I've launched it on my Steam Deck LCD, and it does indeed load up fine now and you can get in-game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7610375921752592512gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7610375921752592512gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Valve note a couple of issues though, preventing it being fully Verified:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This game's launcher/setup tool may require the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or have difficult to read text.</li>
<li>Some functionality is not accessible when using the default controller configuration, requiring use of the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or a community configuration.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does have an Unreal Engine 4 prerequisites installer that needs the touch-screen or emulated mouse input on Steam Deck. Same with agreeing to their terms of service on the initial first run. Then you get to the login, and agreeing to other terms of services. After that, gamepad controls works fine.</p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux, we saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/ge-proton-10-8-brings-fixes-for-doom-eternal-wuthering-waves-and-wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updates to GE-Proton</a> only recently that enabled it to work too. Currently, Proton 9 and Proton Experimental do not work for it out of the box. However, Proton Experimental <em>will</em> allow you to get in if you set this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamOS=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Otherwise, you can use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/ge-proton-10-9-released-with-ntsync-and-fsr4-upgrade-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest GE-Proton 10-9</a> that does it for you. <em>See my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full guide to installing GE-Proton for help</a>.</em></p>

<p>Since it's not supported on Desktop Linux, it could potentially break again. But it works for now. Check out more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page for Linux systems</a>.</p>

      <title>Shark Dentist looks a bit silly, tense, gruesome and I need to play it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't know who thought that it was a good idea to be a Shark Dentist, in what looks like a set from a cheap horror movie - but now I have to try it.</p>
<p>Coming from Alice Games who previously made two VR games Monster Rampage VR, Santa’s Letters VR and the non-VR Broventure: The Wild Co-op. Frankly, I had never heard of any of those until now. Perhaps this silly idea might be their first proper hit. They say it will appeal to "horror fans, streamers, and lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw". I just recently watched The Meg and The Meg 2 as well, so it's rather timely. I do love a bit of dumb monster horror like this.</p>
<p>Your main enemies in it will be: Shark Stress, bringing it ever-closer to waking up and snacking on you; Limited Resources, so don't use too much anaesthetic; and Random Event, where your equipment might fail on you and various "other surprises".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B7HjJipvOxk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6ac7b86ad6fc2c9831e50af553a4c39.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B7HjJipvOxk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Intense Gameplay: Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</li>
<li>Roguelike Mechanics: Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</li>
<li>Multitasking: Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</li>
<li>Realistic Tool Interaction: Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</li>
<li>Organic Balance: Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the press release the dev was inspired by viral sensations like Buckshot Roulette, with it blending dark humour and roguelike mechanics wrapped up in a creepy aesthetic.</p>

      <title>The Alters gets patched to replace AI generated bits, fix a Steam Deck crash and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Alters from 11 bit studios appears to be doing very well, apart from the controversy over the AI generated bits. A new patch is out to fix it up.</p>
<p>Back in June, there was a lot going around about players discovering some AI generated assets in the game, which were not disclosed on store pages like Steam. Not a lot, but enough that it caused a bit of an uproar. The developer posted on social media (like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) with a statement to clear it up noting that they were meant as placeholders. There were also some AI translations for a few licensed in-game movies in the social area that were done due to "extreme time constraints" they had planned to replace.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="965Km7t6KwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/363c3b32c727fb63b37c93538bb3a17a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/965Km7t6KwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/555747819912167772" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch 1.1.0</a>, this should all be cleared up now, as noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Localization and VOs: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple missing and wrong translations.</li>
<li>Occasional missing voiceovers.</li>
<li>Replaced LLM generated text on Command Center asset.</li>
<li>Replaced machine translated subtitles in Social Room movies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair amount of bug fixes came with this update too like a Steam Deck crash when progressing onto a new chapter. Nice to see direct fixes like that.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">The developer also recently revealed that less than a month after release it sold over 280,000 copies as well.</span></p>

      <title>RimWorld – Odyssey expansion is out now along with update 1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld has expanded in a massive way with the Odyssey expansion and the 1.6 update, now available for all players.</p>
<p>This is the fifth expansion to the hit sci-fi colony building sim. Pushing beyond a single map to allow your colonists to build a flying home and travel across the planet and even into space. With new biomes that introduce diverse landmarks and exotic wildlife, and dynamic quests include hunting alpha thrumbos and raiding ancient cryosleep bunker. And when you're done on land you can head into space where you'll find space stations, asteroids and something stirring in the dark.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FutmQwQ-O2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa8dae10770bd166202cd51e00f76a58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FutmQwQ-O2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The game has always created a whole world beyond the colony, but it was hard to get out there and actually explore it,” said Tynan Sylvester, founder of Ludeon Studios. “Turning the whole colony into a giant movable ship unlocks all that latent story potential. And once we did that I figured hell, why not go to orbit as well?”</p>
<p>With the new biomes there's distinct hazards and new opportunities, along with a new landmarks system that transforms the world generation. Giving you many new options to build colonies, there's also a lot of new animal species to find, fishing mechanics were added, multi-part story quests and then list of what's new goes on and on. With all of it coming to a new late-game threat with the machine hive mind.</p>
<p>The expansion also includes a whole new album from Alistair Lindsay, composer of the RimWorld soundtrack.</p>

      <title>Try the big demo upgrade for Demon Tides, an impressive looking open-world 3D platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An open world platformer where you express yourself with different movements, Demon Tides looks like a lot of fun and it just had a huge demo upgrade. It's in development by Fabraz. A name perhaps you might recognise from Slime-san and Demon Turf.</p>
<p>You navigate the open seas to find distant structures, which you then explore with a diverse set of moves. Beat challenges, find chests and go collecting. Some trinkets you find can even modify and expand you abilities and outfits. Looks really cool, check out the original reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BOqwY4H1d0Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/111598e28247bcef261298c0081c75b4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BOqwY4H1d0Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A big 2.0 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585890/view/505080786253254544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demo update</a> just went live that includes a whole lot of performance improvements, especially nice for devices like the Steam Deck. It's a long list of what's changed, including lots of gameplay updates and bug fixes. Well worth a go now and should work fine with Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A deeply expressive platforming move-set that enables you to travel through the world in countless unique ways. Express yourself through your schmovement and get lost in the flow!</li>
<li>Travel the seamless, open ocean and reach any point of interest at blazing speeds! Explore each locale and figure out creative ways to beat challenges or reach certain areas!</li>

<li>Acquire a ton of unique head gear, outfits and hair dyes to change up your appearance! With over 50,000 possible combinations there’s no shortage of drip.</li>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition to release August 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Relic Entertainment have announced that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition is set for release on August 14th. Hopefully it will see a better reception than the recently released Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition, which is currently on Mostly Negative on the Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>At release it will cost $29.99, with a 30% discount if you own the Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pY_JzB0WxSA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d251e766aac3d585242b205b2964c4fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer has mentioned there will be no new content or post-launch DLC, as their focus is on "delivering the ultimate Dawn of War experience" to have everything from the original. As for multiplayer, they're aiming to keep everything mostly the same there apart from "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs that should help improve the multiplayer experience". However, they've also said "not all legacy bugs will be addressed for launch" and they're already planned updates at release.</p>
<p>They also have a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dawnofwar.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky account</a> you can follow too.</p>
<p>Will you be buying it?</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling Frame Gen gets a Decky Loader Steam Deck plugin but there&#39;s drama</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 14/07/2025 at 17:50 UTC - the developer of lsfg-vk, "Pancake", issued a new statement about the situation. This was <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1394368550583668736" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> into the Lossless Scaling Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update on Deck Wizard's video and the Decky plugin</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone! I'd like to clear up some things after the previous announcement, which caused way too much unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I've been talking to both Deck Wizard and Kurt (xXJSONDeruloXx on GitHub), who is the creator of the Decky plugin. The situation we got into was caused purely by poor communication, so we sat down and discussed the future of the plugin together.</p>
<p>Let's get into the news then.<br/>
The Decky plugin will remain unofficial and unsupported in this discord, not as a means to discourage using it, but rather to keep the growing load of support away from me, as I have barely anything to do with the plugin. Together with Kurt and Deck Wizard we've fixed the major labeling issues in the plugin, as well as created an update video on Deck Wizard's channel that you can watch here:<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhkCev9M6lM<br/>
Future support with the Decky plugin will happen in the Discord server linked in the video description and depending on which category your issue falls into, you may be forwarded to this discord instead.</p>
<p>In the future, some pretty big changes will be coming to lsfg-vk which will likely require a portion of the plugin to adapt. I will be working with Kurt to get the changes into the plugin as quickly as possible, however this warrants a whole other announcement and I can't promise any timeframe (it could be hours, days or weeks).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>There's some drama in Steam Deck land with a Decky Loader plugin, that works with Lossless Scaling Frame Generation from the new lsfg-vk project for Linux.</p>
<p>The lsfg-vk project itself was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lsfg-vk-aims-to-bring-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-to-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first covered here on GamingOnLinux on July 7th</a>, and the developer has recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scalings-frame-generation-for-linux-gets-upgraded-to-the-latest-v3-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">managed to upgrade it</a> with the help of the original Lossless Scaling developer. It's still a work in progress and a little rough but it does work.</p>
<p>Since there was a lot of excitement around it, a <em>different</em> developer decided to make a Decky Loader (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-set-up-decky-loader-on-steam-deck-steamos-for-easy-plugins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my Decky Loader guide</a>) plugin (<a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/decky-lossless-scaling-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) to make it easier to work with it on SteamOS / Steam Deck. It was then showcased by the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KCXxhD-Y8s" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deck Wizard</a> but now onto the drama…</p>
<p>The creator of lsfg-vk, "Pancake", <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1394103380787593277" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> this to the Lossless Scaling Discord server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important information regarding the Decky plugin and Deck Wizard's video</strong></p>
<p>A couple of hours ago Deck Wizard has made a video on Lossless Scaling in which they present a new Decky plugin for lsfg-vk.<br/>
On Reddit, the creator of that plugin claimed they had collaborated with me to create this, however this is incorrect and was likely the result of a language barrier.</p>
<p>I was asked to collaborate, but I instead requested them to wait with the plugin until the new configuration system was written, as otherwise a large portion of the plugin would have to be rewritten to account for it. They did not listen and pushed the plugin out without communicating with me beforehand.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the plugin already has many issues such as incorrect labeling of options and misleading descriptions of other options. Likely in collateral, the video created by Deck Wizard further spreads these wrong explanations. I want to clear up these things.<br/>
First of all, the settings recommended by Deck Wizard are 30% flow scale and no performance mode. I can not state enough how terrible these options are. With 30% flow scale, internal calculations are happening in 96x54 images with some going down to 2x1, producing extremely inaccurate results.<br/>
Instead, it is recommended to keep flow scale at 85-100% with performance mode enabled, as this gives a much larger performance boost while retaining immensely higher quality.</p>
<p>Clearly all of this is simply a result of poor communication and as such I will not support the Decky plugin. Do not ask about help with lsfg-vk when using the Decky plugin. Perhaps in the future an official lsfg-vk Decky plugin can be made in actual collaboration with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all seems a bit <em>dramatic</em>. But I don't blame the developer of the original Linux tool wanting things to be correct and ready for it to not be disappointing for users, and not to overwhelm them.</p>
<p>Hopefully this situation will have a happy ending.</p>

      <title>Open source Medal of Honor: Allied Assault adds better bots and a new master server for online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy some Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on modern systems with online play? OpenMoHAA is what you need to check out. Covered here initially on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/medal-of-honor-allied-assault-open-source-remake-gets-a-first-beta-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in November 2024</a>, the community project is quickly coming along with a whole lot of big improvements in the latest v0.82.0-beta release.</p>
<p>Some highlights of this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The navigation system has drastically improved for bots thanks to the Recast Navigation library. The mp-navigation pk3 file is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Docs have been reorganized and clarified. There is a new website for the documentation: <a href="https://docs.openmohaa.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.openmohaa.org/</a>.</li>
<li>On Windows there is now a setup file (MSI) to install OpenMoHAA.</li>
<li>Multiplayer server list has evolved!</li>
<li>Lot of fixes... Including some that address bugs present in the original game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bots are now a lot smarter and can navigate more difficult paths properly including those requiring jumping, falling or climbing ladders and navigating around obstacles. The most exciting addition though is the new master server powered by <a href="https://333networks.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">333networks</a>. With this update OpenMoHAA also now supports multiple master servers, and queries them all together to build the server list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9603253361752486752gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9603253361752486752gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMoHAA multiplayer on Linux</em></p>
<p>OpenMoHAA supports the full original game (including the campaigns) with support for modern systems. Along with plenty of modern enhancements.</p>
<p>You need the original game to work with it that you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy from GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>Running it on Linux is really easy. You can use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a> to download the game from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, then drop the release files from the OpenMoHAA GitHub into the installed folder and launch it.</p>

      <title>Split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS adds support for multiple keyboards and mice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PartyDeck is a free and open source split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS, and the latest release sounds great. I mentioned it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/partydeck-is-a-split-screen-game-launcher-for-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous GamingOnLinux article back in May</a>.</p>
<p>It allows you to run up to 4 instances of a game, supporting both Native Linux and Windows games via Proton. It sets it all up for you, with sandboxing to ensure each instance only sees the control inputs assigned to it and positions the game windows around your screen for you.</p>
<p>Pretty clever stuff, and now with the 0.5.0 release even supports multiple keyboards and mice. You can also now add multiple devices per instance, and there's been a few UI adjustments.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights from the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs up to 4 instances of a game at a time and automatically fits each game window onto the screen.</li>
<li>Supports native Linux games as well as Windows games through Proton.</li>
<li>Handler system that tells the launcher how to handle game files, meaning very little manual setup is required.</li>
<li>Steam multiplayer API is emulated, allowing for multiple instances of Steam games.</li>
<li>Works with most game controllers without any additional setup, drivers, or third-party software.</li>
<li>Now works with multiple keyboards and mice!</li>
<li>Uses sandboxing software to mask out controllers so that each game instance only detects the controller assigned to it, preventing input interference.</li>
<li>Profile support allows each player to have their own persistent save data, settings, and stats for games.</li>
<li>Works out of the box on SteamOS.</li>
</ul>

      <title>System76 reveal the new Adder WS laptop, their &#34;most affordable&#34; powerhouse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux hardware vendor and Pop!_OS Linux distribution developer System76 have revealed the Adder WS laptop, and it's quite powerful. If you're in need of new hardware and need something that has quite a kick, perhaps this may be what you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2981974521752484019gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's their "most affordable power-graphic's unit" but still with quite a cost attached at $2,099. Their press release noted it's a "light workstation laptop".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As standard it comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>15.6" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5050 (2560 CUDA Cores). Other options include:
	<ul>
<li>15.6" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5060 (3328 CUDA Cores).</li>
<li>17.3" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5060 (3328 CUDA Cores).</li>
<li>17.3" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5070 (4608 CUDA Cores).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, up to 5.4 GHz - 36MB cache - 36 TOPS - 24 total cores.</li>
<li>16 GB DDR5 5600 MHz.</li>
<li>1 TB PCIe4 (up to 5,000 MB/s read, 3,600 MB/s write).</li>
<li>WiFi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4.</li>
<li>Built-in Webcam &amp; Microphone.</li>
<li>1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type A), 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 (Type A), 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type C).</li>
<li>1x HDMI, 2x DisplayPort 2.1 over USB-C.</li>
<li>4 cell Polymer battery pack 73WH.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also made a rather silly Infomercial like the classics:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-9 released with NTSYNC and FSR4 upgrade support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 10-9 is out now with some exciting sounding new features like NTSYNC and FSR4 upgrade support for gamers on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is the community-made compatibility layer, not supported by Valve. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to install GE-Proton</a> for more.</p>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added ntsync support:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Enable with PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1</code></p>
<p>NOTES:<br/>
1. Your kernel must be patched with ntsync patches. If your system does not have /dev/ntsync then your kernel does not have the patches required to use ntsync.<br/>
2. Some applications, mostly 32 bit, may also need PROTON_USE_WOW64=1 when using ntsync</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added FSR4 upgrade support via PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=1 (auto upgrades from amd directly <a href="https://download.amd.com/dir/bin/amdxcffx64.dll" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://download.amd.com/dir/bin/amdxcffx64.dll</a>).</li>
<li>Added fixes from upstream for flicker/rendering issue when using wine-wayland.</li>
<li>Refactored a lot of the patches section and cleaned up outdated or merged patches.</li>
<li>Update wine-wayland patches.</li>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git.</li>
<li>Imported all upstream proton changes.</li>
<li>protonfixes: added a fix for winetricks wget gnutls failing inside fex.</li>
<li>protonfixes: add fix for sifu freeze (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10087377661752482846gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sifu</em></p>
<p>Before getting too excited about NTSYNC though, do note what Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned that I included in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux kernel 6.14 release post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already include fsync, which should be as fast or faster as ntsync. We developed ntsync as a general solution that'd be acceptable in upstream Wine, but there's no urgency in including it in the Deck / SteamOS kernel.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.12 brings EGL backend in the X11 driver, support for Bluetooth Low Energy services</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.12 is out now as the latest development release towards Wine 11, bringing new features and bug fixes for running Windows apps / games on Linux. <em>Wine is also a major part of Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as the highlights of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional EGL backend in the X11 driver.</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth Low Energy services.</li>
<li>More support for generating Windows Runtime metadata in WIDL.</li>
<li>ARM64 builds enabled in Gitlab CI.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a pretty old memory leak <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19561" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug</a> that was checked off with this release, from way back in 2009. Looks like it was actually fixed quite a few years ago. A fair amount of bugs that are noted with each Wine release aren't necessarily fixed with this specific version, it's just what bug reports they've gone over to see if they still happen. There's probably quite a lot of these older reports that still need checking given the size of the Wine project.</p>

<p>The Blender Studio team have now released DOGWALK, a free casual game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. A showcase of what's possible with free and open source tools.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://studio.blender.org/projects/dogwalk/production-logs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, their team put up various development logs you can read over to see how they got on with Godot. Originally they said "The goal of this project is to create a pipeline between Blender and Godot to make the asset and level creation process as seamless as possible".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore - You are let loose to roam camping grounds, forest paths, idyllic creeks and a frozen pond in this miniature open world.</li>
<li>Bound together - Guide or drag around your little kid owner that you have in tow. Help each other out, be a menace or be a good boy.</li>
<li>Play your way - Dive straight in and have the game react to your play-style and choices. There are no fail states. Only player driven moments.</li>
<li>A paper craft world - Traverse an environment made of real-life paper crafted models, scanned and recreated to be played with.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code and various assets it's made with are also available, but you need to subscribe to Blender Studio to access all of it. The game itself is completely free though. You can also buy the Supporter Pack on Steam for the source code.</p>

      <title>Limbo and Inside are getting delisted from GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/limbo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/inside" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Inside</a> from studio Playdead are being delisted, so you might want to grab them while you can.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/delisting_limbo_and_inside/post1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> GOG made didn't go into details and just said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to inform you that Limbo and Inside will be removed from our store on July 17th, 2025, 3 PM CEST.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have any information on discounts yet.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could have better news for you, but grab it while it's still here!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? We can only speculate at this point but it's likely related to the ongoing legal spat between Playdead and co-founder Dino Patti.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5451388291752481194gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Inside from Playdead</em></p>
<p>Back in March, Patti <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dinopatti_dino-we-made-it-thats-what-he-told-activity-7303723474152230913-QJ9G/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on LinkedIn to note "My old partner has threatened me with an IP lawsuit because I used a publicly available picture, in a linkedin post 3 months ago, of the game LIMBO that we created at Playdead together" and that Patti would make it public if it continued (which it obviously did). The post showed the latest legal threat letter that Patti had received.</p>
<p>According to an article from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-playdead-has-filed-a-lawsuit-against-its-co-founder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>, Playdead followed up with an actual lawsuit against Patti in June.</p>
<p>No word if the games will be removed from other stores but it's entirely possible.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated to fix the Epic Games Store and a few games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out a small update to Proton Experimental to begin the weekend, with fixes for the Epic Games Store and a few games for Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all the changes below for the July 11th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed experimental regressions:
	<ul>
<li>RiME should no longer exhibit weird windowing behavior when Alt+Tabbing on certain setups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed intro video in Warhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron - Flyboyz Edition having no audio.</li>
<li>Fixed Warrior Maiden Lecia and the Lost Fortress hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fixed video playback in Roboquest.</li>
<li>Fixed sending feedback not working in Cosmoteer: Starship Architect &amp; Commander.</li>
<li>Fixed Teardown hanging when publishing a mod to the workshop.</li>
<li>Fixed a recent update causing Epic Games Store not launching under Proton.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a></em></p>
<p>For anyone confused why Epic Games Store is noted it's because <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can install it using Proton inside of Steam</a>. I mentioned to Proton developers while working on that linked guide that it was broken, and it was fixed in the bleeding-edge Beta only a day later and now it's in Proton Experimental proper.</p>

      <title>Try having a shotgun for an arm in the demo for Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation is an upcoming retro-styled completely over the top FPS, it looks awesome and a demo is now live.</p>
<p>One I missed that was shown off during THE MIX event earlier this year. The game as a whole just sounds completely nuts. The developers own explanation of it is just ridiculous too. As they explain: "The hot pink-wearing, fish-chomping, cigar-huffing Captain Wayne refuses to let anything stand between him and his gory conquest to rob and humiliate every rich asshole around the globe."</p>
<p>You're also missing an arm, chomped away by a legendary "Vampire Whale" and so you replaced it for a shotgun. Now you're marooned, with your ship stolen and so off you set "annihilating everyone responsible".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3tNdGudqdCk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a9ca927e791002b2b3c9d6dba90df4e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3tNdGudqdCk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's actually using GZDoom, so you can most likely get it running in the Linux version of GZDoom. Otherwise, Proton is an option to try if you love your retro-fuelled shooters.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Witness an elaborately hand-drawn, action-packed epic inspired by the FPS greats!</li>
<li>Make use of the many devastating weapons in Wayne’s arsenal and achieve maximum destruction!</li>
<li>Explore dangerous locales through 8 humongous areas all across Orca Isle!</li>
<li>HALF GAME, HALF CARTOON! Delight in the Captain’s depth-defying tale in CAMPAIGN MODE as you view tons of animated cutscenes exploring his adventure.</li>
<li>Experience a high-octane soundtrack that emphasizes AGGRESSION and CHAOS!</li>
<li>Go for the gold in our ENDLESS MODE–how long can you survive the onslaught?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo is live on Steam now.</p>

      <title>SuperWEIRD is a co-op mixture of automation, tower defense and adventuring</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SuperWEIRD is the next planned game from developers Luden.io, merging together a few different genres into something thoroughly odd.</p>
<p>Even the developer is confused about it. As they said: "We want to cross tower-defense gameplay with co-op and automation, and see what comes out of this mix. You find yourself in a place that's obviously broken. The local store is closed, the robots are malfunctioning, and there are occasional golem attacks in the wilderness. This all sounds SuperWEIRD, so... Good luck?"</p>
<p>In the game you will open up your own store, and then gather resources to craft goods to sell to the locals. While also fending off thieving robots. The developer previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">while True: learn()</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1724140/Craftomation_101/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Craftomation 101</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150090/Learning_Factory/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Learning Factory</a> so of course there's a little programming involved with helper bots (but all simple - no coding skills required they say).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwIWbkia6V0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8012af773e8809f52ea034e232f81d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwIWbkia6V0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use flags to mark paths for an endless stream of mindless robots.</li>
<li>Make them harvest resources and craft stuff for you.</li>
<li>Arm your robots, or even better: make robots arm other robots.</li>
<li>Build and optimize huge and complex systems of robots.</li>
<li>Play with friends in co-op mode to make things better… or much worse.</li>
<li>Outsmart the madness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly educational too. It's being developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.carina.fund/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Carina Initiatives</a>, a nonprofit philanthropic foundation working on building a deep and connected math talent ecosystem.</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation for Linux gets upgraded to the latest v3.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The dev of the popular Lossless Scaling app has been helping the lsfg-vk project that brings Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation to Linux to get it upgraded.

<p>Writing in the official Discord for Lossless Scaling, the developer behind the lsfg-vk project noted how they've had help from the original Lossless Scaling developer THS behind the scenes. Thanks to their help lsfg-vk has now been updated to support LSFG 3.1 (the latest version of LSFG).</p>
<p>As developer Pancake said on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1393003249224777858" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update to LSFG 3.1</strong></p>
<p>As promised the new version of lsfg-vk is updated to use LSFG 3.1, making it both faster and better!<br/>
When updating, make sure you change the branch on Steam back to the normal release branch.</p>
<p>This new release also brings with it the <code class="inline-code">LSFG_FLOW_SCALE</code> property, which can be used to override the flow scale from 1.0 (100%) down to 0.25 (25%). If you're encountering performance issues, you might want to consider lowering this option. Performance mode not yet supported unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the updates there's now a new LSFG 3.1 Benchmark you can use with instructions added to <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki/Configuring-lsfg%E2%80%90vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Installing it should be a little bit easier now too, as the developer also announced they've enabled a GitHub workflow to build binaries constantly. However, it builds on Arch Linux so will only work on Arch-based systems. They've also made an installation script too but it still needs further testing and expanding to support more distributions.</p>
<p>Over time, as more people use it and help with it, I expect it to get a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>You can get it on <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for Linux but you do need to own Lossless Scaling on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Craft-and-thrive adventure Squirreled Away tweaks the graphics for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Squirreled Away is a cute casual craft-and-thrive adventure that you can play solo or with friends, and now it should work great out of the box on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Checking off the last thing on the list to get it bumped up from Playable to Verified, the developers have implemented new graphics options with a default for the Steam Deck to perform better. Manually configuring it was why Valve gave it a Playable rating, so it's likely now it can be Steam Deck Verified with a big green tick. It's also SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>The developers also "significantly" lowered the CPU and GPU usage while in the main menu. As for content there's also some new stuff in this update. They added in the "Telly-porter", a TV that allows you to transport between places which sounds pretty great.</p>
<p>Not seen it before? It's super cute. Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Rotate and unfold the world in the wonderful 3D platformer PaperKlay - now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible! PaperKlay is a gorgeous 3D platformer collect-a-thon with a world made of paper, cardboard and clay.</p>
<p>There's so many great games releasing that I miss quite a lot of them. But, sifting through Steam Deck announcements helps me surface some real gems like this. It features a catchy soundtrack with tracks from composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee) and Steven Melin (Dark Dice, Moonlighter) along with a surprising voice cast. Some of the voices you might recognise from the likes of Sly Cooper, Five Nights at Freddy's, Attack on Titan &amp; more.</p>
<p>After the May 27th release, the developer WhyKev put out a bunch of patches and thanks to all the work it has been rated Verified by Valve as of July 8th.</p>

      <title>Stress-testing app OCCT switches to Vulkan by default dropping DirectX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular stress-testing app OCCT <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/stress-testing-toolkit-occt-arrives-on-steam-with-linux-and-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently landed on Steam</a>, and the first major update here swaps DirectX for Vulkan by default.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Explaining their reasoning they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3515100/announcements/detail/499451286721140342" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why?<br/>
- On Linux, OpenCL support is optional, and finding which OpenCL adapter corresponds to which in DirectX is particularly challenging, making it hard to tell which adapter from one API matches the one reported by another.<br/>
- On Windows, maintaining a separate DirectX rendering path added unnecessary complexity.<br/>
<br/>
And Vulkan gives us:<br/>
- A unified GPU detection algorithm across platforms<br/>
- A simpler, more robust codebase<br/>
- Slightly better performance and even more accurate results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like it makes sense for them, simplifies things overall since Vulkan supports both platforms they currently support. Nice to see Vulkan making inroads with more developers and not just in games. They explain a bit more in the video below:</p>

      <title>Unrailed! gets fixed for Steam Deck and an update for controllers on Linux / macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unrailed! from Indoor Astronaut is a great co-op multiplayer game that's good fun with friends, and now works properly on Steam Deck / Linux again.</p>
<p>Specifically, they fixed up the Native Linux version of the game, which was having problems crashing with the latest SteamOS release. Valve actually rated the game Verified with the Native version being the default. They've also updated the version of SDL they use which they said "should solve several issues where controllers could not get recognized".</p>
<p>I did a play-through only recently with family, and had to end up using Proton as the Native version just wouldn't work. Nice to see it properly fixed out of the box now. While it's good that the option was there it's still quite annoying to see a Verified game just suddenly broken like that. Once again, Proton saved the day. At least in this case, the Native version is still actively supported by the developer.</p>

      <title>First-person horror platformer Blessed Burden adds Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First-person platforming with a dose of horror? Sounds interesting! Blessed Burden recently added Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>In the game you play as the "last priest" as you descend deeper into "the deepest depths to destroy the very essence of evil" as you avoid traps, lava and fear itself. There's no need to rush in this one, how you play it is entirely up to you. You can go fast and aggressive or slow and steady while you take in the atmosphere and lore. With a skill upgrade system, you'll gradually get access to improve various movement skills.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LOQAs0XKFo0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0d8e23264b010ae914bbdc3cae046fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LOQAs0XKFo0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Originally released on June 18th, the Linux and Steam Deck support came in with the July 9th update. This update also added Steam Input support, the ability to race against your own ghost character and various quality of life improvements.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>10 levels – from mushroom caves to brutalist megastructures.</li>
<li>1.5 hours for a first playthrough.</li>
<li>Horror-infused religious atmosphere.</li>
<li>Deconstructivist, brutalist, and infernal architecture.</li>
<li>Retro visuals with a modern flair.</li>
<li>Unique soundtrack – a fusion of church choirs, ritual percussion, and industrial sound.</li>
<li>Devil’s suspenseful monologues.</li>
<li>Movement skill upgrade system.</li>

      <title>Raid an abandoned Soviet R&amp;D Institute in the single-player extraction shooter Red Light</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With intense action, Red Light is a single-player extraction shooter not to be missed if you love your retro-styled shooters. It originally launched back in June which I missed and just recently had an update that should improve the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: "You are Max, on a mission to find your missing brother. Your only lead takes you to an old Soviet R&amp;D Institute, now taken over by mercenaries and creepy results of human experiments. Fight your way through enemies, complete quests, and go deeper underground with each level. The more you explore, the more secrets you uncover about what really happened here. Gear up, stay sharp, and get ready for a dangerous journey into the unknown."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fight against monsters, mercenaries and bosses as you head into an abandoned mega structure.</li>
<li>Search every corner for useful gear, supplies, and valuables. Everything you find can help you survive — or be sold later for profit.</li>
<li>Stock up on food, water, ammo, and meds. Once you are inside, you are on your own until exits open. Complete tasks, find better gear and upgrade your stats to improve your chances for the next raid.</li>
<li>Make it to the exfil point to keep your loot — or die and lose everything you found and brought with you.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Plant, grow and harvest in the farming roguelite deckbuilder Cropdeck - sign up the Playtest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending two very different ideas together, Cropdeck brings farming to deckbuilders and it's actually really good. I highlighted this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/cropdeck-blends-farming-and-deckbuilders-together-to-make-a-wonderful-looking-mix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously on GamingOnLinux back in February</a>.</p>
<p>The developer sent over advanced access to the upcoming Steam Playtest, which you can apply for now to begin on July 17th. If you like a challenge and deckbuilders, this is one you're likely to find really interesting. The developer is planning full Native Linux and Steam Deck support too (which already worked great in my testing).</p>
<p>More about it: "Clear your fields, plant crops strategically, and protect them from wild weather. Combine quirky scarecrows and their powerful passive effects to create satisfying combos. Build your deck of plants — and don’t forget to pay taxes, because Sir Landlord always comes for his share! All wrapped in a wholesome and charming package."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VkmWH1ypkzY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2f2fc10ed47b221af0cec58558ce34ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VkmWH1ypkzY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What to expect in the Playtest? A small but "juicy slice" of what's planned for the full game. The developer said to expect about 2 hour of gameplay.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go to the Steam page and tap the "Request Access" button when logged in.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madheadbump.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow the developer on Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Oblivion Remastered v1.2 gets a Beta with lots of fixes and optimisations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is getting quite a big update soon, with version 1.2 now in Beta on Steam.</p>
<p>As usual for a Bethesda game, it came with lots of issues but with their partners at Virtuos they've been clearly busy trying to make it a worthy game to fully play through. The majority of the update is fixing up bugs players have encountered, along with adding in some additional difficulty settings to tweak your experience. However, they've also done various optimisations to improve performance too - so perhaps it might actually deserve that Steam Deck Verified rating eventually.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6040624611752149542gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Try the big demo update for Dicey Bugs, a turn-based deckbuilder where you control both sides</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dicey Bugs is a roguelike, turn-based deckbuilder where you control both sides of the battles. A new demo is live now woth support for Linux and Windows. In the 2.0 demo update the developer has added in the ability to save, new content and various fixes but it only scratches the surface of what will be in the full release due out later this year.</p>
<p>I like the mixture of features this one has that blends genres together. It's a deck-builder, but your deck is built up from creatures that you can collect from the battles.</p>
<p>Check out their initial trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T3YD_Dest9U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30c5a040d6177c0bb06a574ec331b440.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T3YD_Dest9U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it, some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take command of turn-based battles by strategically deciding when to play both your dice and your enemy’s, shaping the outcome of each turn.</li>
<li>Capture weakened foes during battle to recruit them into your current party or save them for future runs.</li>
<li>Build your party from recruited units and modify your starting dice for countless strategic possibilities.</li>
<li>Optimize your party's effectiveness by chaining abilities and using complementary equipment.</li>
<li>Upgrade your units and customize your dice by unlocking rewards and spending coins at the shop.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Chilled dino ranching game Paleo Pines is crowdfunding for a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paleo Pines released back in September 2023 and it's set for a big free update, but the developer is gathering the needed funds on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Speaking about why they needed a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paleopines/paleo-pines-players-choice" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund it they said that while it has been a success in terms of reception and reach, the reality is that the financial benefits have "primarily gone to our publishers" — ouch. Most of their funding to keep going has been via merchandise like plushies. They go on to note how funding for "independent developers have been drying up at an alarming rate", with no other publishers jumping in to boost it.</p>
<p>And so they're trying a Kickstarter for the update. Seems it was a good idea with it hitting £101,143 at time of writing against their original £75,000 goal. So the free update is funded for all players of the game, with extra funding now going towards even more new features to come.</p>
<p>See the original launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pKD9XKRkiMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/060eb9d7540648ecdb8de410bccc6613.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pKD9XKRkiMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What will the update actually add in? They plan to add the Spinosaurus, more dream stones, a new shooting stars system and significant performance optimisations at a minimum. With other additions if they manage to pull in even more funding like a big new swamp biome. </p>
<p>The base game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Simple GOG client for Linux, Minigalaxy version 1.4 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minigalaxy is a simple and to the point <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> game downloader for Linux, with a brand new release in version 1.4 now available. It might not have all the bells and whistles that the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic and Lutris</a> have, but it's still a nice option if GOG is your main store of choice.</p>
<p>A lot of this update is general improvements to how the apps works, especially with downloads and installs so a lot more should work as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14887000771752066723gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Minigalaxy client on Linux showing the games list" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14887000771752066723gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>STEEL HUNTERS is another live service casualty as it&#39;s shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STEEL HUNTERS from Wargaming Group only arrived on Steam in April, and it's already going to be shut down by the developers.</p>
<p>The Early Access title from the developers of World of Warships and World of Tanks just didn't hit the mark. Looking at player counts on Steam, it dropped pretty rapidly after the initial release to well below 1,000 concurrent players in that same month. Its all-time peak was only 4,479, so for such a game it never really lived.</p>
<p>Writing in Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the servers will remain only for 90 days along with adding custom game support for the remaining time. They said it's simply "not sustainable" to continue developing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2517395081752057321gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They had some stiff competition with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/mecha-break-is-out-now-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-blocks-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mecha BREAK</a>, which sadly doesn't work on Desktop Linux but does on Steam Deck due to the annoying <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>.</p>
<p>STEEL HUNTERS was rated Steam Deck Playable and worked on Desktop Linux with Proton. </p>

      <title>MR FARMBOY is like Stardew Valley but with automation and optimization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming to Early Access later in July, MR FARMBOY blends elements of Stardew Valley with automation and optimisation. Sounds like it could be a fun idea and you can try this early too as there's a demo available.</p>
<p>It has all the usual elements you would expect from a more casual farming game like resource gathering, planting and selling crops, animal husbandry, constructing various buildings and more. Where it differs from others in the genre are the automation systems. You can hire workers to automate various tasks, as you build bigger and expand and eventually attempt to optimise and automate everything.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="45zSAIe7p0I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7326de35ad9ca42909dc0ea44f21e419.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/45zSAIe7p0I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Could be an interesting one.</p>
<p>The Steam release is currently planned for July 23rd to begin Early Access. According to what the developer said it will only be in there for a few months while they add some more content including more buildings, new crops, new resources, objectives and so on.</p>

      <title>Operation Octo is an upcoming frantic aquatic Tower Defense with big boss fights</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a fresh Tower Defense game to try out? Here's another tip for you! Operation Octo arrives in September with a chance to try it early.</p>
<p>One that should perhaps be a bit on the different side as the developer explained: "It is a Tower Defense Game that incorporates Bullet Hell and Plants vs. Zombies in terms of gameplay and aesthetics". You fend off hordes of skeletons by placing down sea creatures to fight them off. Over time your defense line may fall, resulting in turning into a game of survival when you're running for your life.</p>
<p>It just had a big demo update over the weekend too. Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oQ-3gOKMqNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bad5d06c3b91da8faa416c52b3d1d2c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oQ-3gOKMqNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock Turrets: Your arsenal is filled with mechanized sea lives! Those cool inventions (such as Pistol Shrimp, Navy Seal, and Death Ray) will handle the fight. You’ll discover new turret types one after another - Figure out how best to utilize each of ‘em!</li>
<li>Skeleton Enemies: Did you know that most humans who ever lived are dead? Tons of skeletons end up in the ocean, and are terrorizing local ecosystems. Fight sword-swinging pirates, poison-wielding chemists, and even skeletal dragons… Those skeletons are sure to shake up your playstyle at every turn!</li>
<li>Unique Biomes: As you adventure the seven seas, you’ll add more creatures into your turret collection, and face new and exciting dangers. Adapting to changing environments is key to survival: Don’t misstep into a toxic brine pool, or forget your light in the darkness of the deep sea.</li>
<li>Turret Upgrades: Skeletons will sometimes drop a variety of Elixirs. Use them to boost turrets into different forms! Will you turn a turret into a frosty ice machine, a powerful mutant, or a shadowy stealth weapon?</li>
<li>Boss Fights: Special levels featuring larger-than-life boss enemies with formidable abilities!</li>
<li>Awesome Upbeat Soundtrack: Seriously, the composers are amazing</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer mentioned they've mostly made it solo too while in College.</p>

      <title>Vehicle No. 4 has you build your own vehicle in this horde survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo live on Steam, Vehicle No. 4 could be one to watch if you love your horde survival games with you building your own vehicle. So it's perhaps a little like a top-down 2D version of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/terratech-legion-could-be-the-best-survivor-like-ever-with-vehicle-building/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TerraTech Legion</a>.</p>
<p>You get to freely place weapons and upgrade them with unique models as you face ever-increasing challenges. There's no points for style in this one, it's all about building the ultimate horde-smashing machine. Nice to see more slightly unique takes on this whole genre explosion thanks to Vampire Survivors. With the smaller areas, it looks much more like an arena-battler like Brotato too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i_BYd_VKbks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ce67f11f0267040e68be33485a28bde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i_BYd_VKbks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Vehicle No. 4  is coming sometime soon in August to Early Access.</p>
<p>I'll be keeping an eye on it for the Early Access release as I continue my quest to play everything in this horde smashing genre. Something about it has me hooked, much like Pokemon I have to <s>catch</s> play them all.</p>

      <title>In Silence Waits is an upcoming modern take on classic graphical adventures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Older readers might be interested in this one. Silent Shoals Software announced In Silence Waits, a modern take on classic graphical adventures.</p>
<p>They previously released The Aching back in 2023. With this being a follow-up in the same setting. With the game driven by a combination of arrow keys and parser input, In Silence Waits continues The Aching‘s "precedent of a methodical approach to adventure games".</p>
<p>More about it: "Having been dropped off before a forgotten landmark in the midst of a sheltered canyon, you’ll guide this bard through dangers untold as he searches for a passage to this rare city of peace. You’ll meet several creatures along the way, both friendly and fearsome: some looking for kinship, others for a quick meal. So be wary, traveler! Aid comes in all shapes and sizes, but so does danger. In this world, not all monsters must be feared, and not all friendly faces should be trusted."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5312396201752052205gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This isn't just a retro looking adventure, it's built to be retro too but with some modern touches. Talking about the software behind it they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine behind <em>In Silence Waits</em>, first developed for <em>The Aching</em>, is 100% backwards compatible with PCs all the way back to the original IBM 5160 and the Tandy 1000, with optional support for CGA 4-color graphics, VGA 256 color graphics, and a variety of era appropriate audio devices including the Roland MT-32, General MIDI, and even the Sound Blaster and Adlib sound cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the PC release (with Linux support) they noted it's using DOSBox Staging.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered gets a new way to play - chronologically</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the developers of The Last of Us Part II Remastered still suggest you play it the original way, now you can play it chronologically.</p>
<p>Originally and as the default, the game is told in a non-linear way with it mixing together various flashbacks and present-day story-lines. They said the structure of it is "very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II’s themes and narrative beats to impact players". This new mode instead sticks it all along a linear timeline so it flows a bit more naturally together that they believe "players will gain even deeper insight into Part II's narrative".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20580189071752051457gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Available as a free update there's also UNCHARTED-themed skins of Joel and Tommy added as well, which you can unlock by playing the new Chronological mode.</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the new Chronological mode.</li>
<li>Introduced UNCHARTED-themed skins for Joel and Tommy as reward for completing Chronological mode.</li>
<li>Implemented achievements and trophies related to Chronological mode.</li>
<li>Dynamic blood drips now appear as expected for higher framerates up to 160 FPS.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where dynamic blood drips would stop appearing upon restarting an encounter.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that stopped dynamic blood drips to appear when disabling the Full Screen Effects setting.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where animations of some gore effects were missing when using a finishing melee attack on human enemies.</li>
<li>Hair and cloth movement physics now also function correctly at framerates above 100 FPS.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the weapon HUD would occasionally not appear at a framerate of 80 FPS or higher.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused players to be unable to shoot with a bow on their first attempt after clicking "Restart Checkpoint" with the mouse.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Permadeath Completion or Speedrun Recap to not appear after completing the Story in Permadeath Mode or Speedrun Mode.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where the boat’s haptic feedback was missing during a cinematic of ‘The Island’ chapter.</li>
<li>Added a new credits sequence specific to PC release.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes related to ultrawide cinematics.</li>
<li>Various localization text related updates and corrections.</li>
<li>Various accessibility bug fixes.</li>
<li>Stability improvements.</li>
<li>Performance optimizations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam now has a UI scaling slider and accessibility menu on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Valve continue updating Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-update-brings-accessibility-settings-and-proton-enabled-by-default-to-make-linux-gaming-simpler/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with better accessibility options</a>, the latest Beta makes it super easy to make Steam bigger (or smaller). The single change for the July 8th Steam Desktop Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545613182900637815" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> it "Added a UI scale slider to desktop accessibility settings".</p>
<p>Nice to see for those who need to adjust the Steam UI:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7965105351752049696gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's still some quirks they need to work out. One I found is that when you increase the UI size, the settings page window pictured above expands to fit all the text. But when you reduce the size, the window <em>stays</em> bigger. Minor issue I'm sure they'll solve soon.</p>
<p>A day before on July 7th, that Accessibility menu on Steam Desktop was added as part of a slightly larger set of fixes and improvements for the desktop client. A lot of it focusing on the new In-Game Overlay that doesn't have proper Linux support yet (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you should use MangoHud</a>).</p>
<p>July 7th <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545613182900637419" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added an accessibility settings menu to desktop, featuring high contrast and reduced motion settings.</li>
<li>Added accessibility annotations to many UI components.</li>
</ul>
<strong>In-Game Overlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed fonts and UI in the overlay being somewhat fuzzy, aligned unevenly, or appearing over anti-aliased for users with Display Scale (DPI) &gt; 100%.</li>
<li>Implement DPI scaling of Performance Monitor display (if you have &gt; 100% display scale, your size will change on update and you may need to adjust it again, this should be a one time inconvenience).</li>
<li>Fixed a case where FPS vs DLSS numbers could be incorrect in some games loading DLSS modules.</li>
<li>Fix some cases where numeric labels in the Performance Monitor display could cut off their last digit when drawing.</li>
<li>Fixed Performance Monitor hot-key changes while in-game not immediately taking effect.</li>
<li>Performance improvement for Vulkan overlay rendering (most obvious when Performance Monitor FPS chart rendering).</li>
<li>Performance improvement for Open GL overlay rendering in games using the Open GL shader pipeline (again most obvious when Performance Monitor FPS chart rendering, this fix doesn't impact old games using the Open GL fixed function pipeline).</li>
<li>Fixed Performance Monitor rendering on macOS if certain fonts are not available.</li>
<li>Fixed overlay background not extending to full game window dimensions at some aspect ratios.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed 8BitDo controller guide button showing the Xbox logo.</li>
<li>Fixed page shift when scrolling through link buttons on game details page.</li>
<li>Fixed achievement presentation in app activity feed and post-game summary panels.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added support for analog activators on d-pad modes for joysticks and trackpads.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced stutter when a Remote Play client with many shortcuts becomes available for streaming.</li>
</ul>
<strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix game info panel not animating open on game details page.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For SteamOS / Steam Deck these are the latest updates across the two Betas:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added accessibility annotations to many UI components.</li>
<li>Show screen reader shortcut in accessibility settings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>

      <title>AMD CPU Transient Scheduler Attacks security flaw revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made public today is a fresh round of security issues, this time for AMD CPUs with Transient Scheduler Attacks. It affects quite a lot of processors including desktop, mobile and data centre.</p>
<p>From AMD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD discovered several transient scheduler attacks related to the execution timing of instructions under specific microarchitectural conditions while investigating a Microsoft report titled "<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/enter-exit-page-fault-leak-testing-isolation-boundaries-for-microarchitectural-leaks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Enter, Exit, Page Fault, Leak: Testing Isolation Boundaries for Microarchitectural Leaks</a>".</p>
<p>AMD has debugged these patterns and identified a speculative side channel affecting AMD CPUs . In some cases, an attacker may be able to use this timing information to infer data from other contexts, resulting in information leakage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some CPUs will not be getting updates for any of the issues or only for some, as AMD note some issues do "not result in leakage of sensitive information" but that depends on the exact processor series.</p>
<p>The CVEs are noted below:</p>

      <title>Rhythm of Resistance is the &#34;world&#39;s first&#34; rhythm metroidvania</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not entirely sure if their announcement of it being the "world's first" truly holds up, but I can't say I've seen anything like Rhythm of Resistance.</p>
<p>The game is expected to arrive sometime in 2026 so it's a while away but the trailer grabbed my firm attention. The way you use the tunes as your weapon to change your surroundings, enemy behaviour, reveal hidden paths and solve puzzles certainly sounds like music to my ears.</p>
<p>With music being the key feature here they've pulled in the Swedish bands ABU NEIN along with Underground Fire. With more to be announced as the game development goes on. Joel Fjällsby, Founder &amp; Creative Director at Nethermoon Game Studio said, "I wanted the music to be real songs with lyrics and everything. Like an old track you could actually find on a forgotten cassette tape. With this in mind, I reached out to bands that felt like a great fit — and everyone so far has fallen in love with the project."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1KshKvp_vhc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dbadee32e545eb4125bd36f701a6e1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1KshKvp_vhc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Joel Fjällsby, Founder &amp; Creative Director at NetherMoon Game Studio said, "I’ve always been drawn to dark music, dystopian worlds, and of course Metroidvanias — so this project is the perfect fusion of everything I love. Honestly, I’m surprised no one’s made a game like this before. It’s a massive undertaking, especially for a new studio, but I love every hour of it. Seeing this dark, mysterious world come alive is incredibly rewarding."</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>World’s first rhythm based Metroidvania where every beat defies the void, and your playlist is your weapon! </li>
<li>Wield the force of music to unlock exciting features and abilities.</li>
<li>Discover 20+ forbidden cassette tapes,each one distorting reality in strange and surprising ways while dynamically changing your game experience</li>
<li>Choose your tracks wisely to alter enemy behaviour, reveal hidden paths, and solve musical puzzles.</li>
<li>Stay on the beat to stay alive! Attack, parry, dodge, and unleash powerful abilities in sync with the dark pulse of your chosen song.</li>
<li>Traverse a vast interlinked world of cathedrals, catacombs and factories to uncover clues of a long-forgotten past.</li>
<li>Collect spare parts to upgrade your music player and unlock new abilities.</li>
<li>Featuring a haunting gothic darkwave soundtrack from a range of underground artists.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The big Diplomacy Update for X4: Foundations is now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Diplomacy Update for X4: Foundations is now in Beta bringing some huge new features to the popular space sim. It's an opt-in Beta with a password, details on accessing it are available on <a href="https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=192&amp;t=405397" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their forum</a>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Diplomacy is the biggest feature addition in this upcoming release. You get a whole new Embassy Room to deal with various faction diplomats. There's also the new Agents class of NPCs to hire to help with negotiation or espionage that you can send off on a range of operations. Starting off with two agents, they have their own experience system to level up and specialise.</p>
<p>Egosoft say the biggest most game-changing addition is that you can "now trigger and influence dynamic diplomatic standing between NPC factions" which can have an "extraordinary impact on the galaxy, as alliances, trade partners and supply chains shift".</p>
<p>Sounds like a sweet update.</p>

      <title>Bazzite gets a new app store, newly supported devices, improved WiFi and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular Linux gaming image Bazzite has a July 2025 update out with some interesting new features and expanded device support.</p>
<p>For new devices the ASUS ROG Z13 2025 is now fully supported along with the ONEXPLAYER X1 Mini Pro too. There's also a Linux kernel version bump to 6.15.4, with a few of their own fixes added in for hardware support.</p>
<p>One addition that sounds quite interesting is the new WiFi service IWD (iNet Wireless Daemon) from Intel, which can solve various issues they listed including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodic WIFI scanning causing latency jumps/freezes while streaming games (e.g., Sunshine).</li>
<li>Slower WIFI compared to Windows on mesh networks.</li>
<li>Network dropouts in busy areas or under dense mesh networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not enabled by default though.</p>
<p>A big change for Bazzite's Desktop Mode is the new app store named Bazaar. It has a pure focus on Flatpak, so it's a good fit for projects like Bazzite. They said it allows them to directly curate recommendations too, it has better performance than other app stores and they've tweaked it to remove certain Flatpaks like Steam that would cause problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20114925781751967960gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20114925781751967960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>I definitely need to personally get Bazzite installed on something soon. I've been planning to build a living room SteamOS box for a while, I just need to push myself to actually do it.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31.1.0 released with Multitrack Video for Linux, explicit sync support for PipeWire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio 31.1.0 is out now with various new features and improvements, and it's a nice release for Linux users too.</p>
<p>This release finally includes support for Multitrack Video on Linux, otherwise known as Enhanced Broadcasting on Twitch. This feature enables you to send multiple video qualities to your streaming platform, since they don't guarantee they will do it for you to give viewers different quality options.</p>
<p>For Linux this release also adds explicit sync support for PipeWire Screen Capture, this should ensure all graphics drivers get good capture performance and accuracy. There's more goodies for Linux to like a hardware accelerated browser source (not supported on NVIDIA yet) and a few bug fixes.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.14 Beta brings wake-on-bluetooth back to the Steam Deck LCD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released SteamOS 3.7.14 Beta, which for Steam Deck LCD owners is probably going to be popular as it brings back wake-on-bluetooth. This is still experimental though, after it was entirely disabled in the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steamos-3-7-13-update-gets-fixes-for-more-handhelds-fixes-wifi-regression-on-steam-deck-oled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7.13 release</a> following from being enabled in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial SteamOS 3.7 release</a>.</p>
<p>That is the only change for this SteamOS Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD, including support for LE peripherals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/529850584204840829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve</a></p>
<p>To try it out you need to be in the Beta or Preview channel. You can opt in via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3628861261751918948gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Even Valve appear to be getting confused by their own version numbers at this point too. As we had the SteamOS 3.17.3 stable release and the SteamOS 3.7.13 Beta that were somehow separate, but now we're up to SteamOS 3.7.14 so back to normal.</p>
<p>My LCD Steam Deck since the 3.7.13 Beta has also been doing the repeating issue of showing me the same update available again, which Valve were <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-deck-steamos-will-now-stop-bugging-you-to-install-updates-multiple-times/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supposed to have solved</a> previously. Hopefully with the 3.7.14 Beta it will stop doing it again.</p>

      <title>Adorable Adventures is a gorgeous upcoming adventure featuring a mischievous baby boar</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aww. Adorable Adventures is just the kind of game I needed to see today, one that's going right up on my wishlist. From French developer Wild Sheep Studio, who previously worked on the VR orchestra conducting rhythm game Maestro.</p>
<p>More about it: "Adorable Adventures is a cozy third-person exploration game where you play as Boris, a curious baby boar who has to learn how to use his nose to reunite his family after a forest fire. From peaceful forest meadows, rocky highlands, dark caves to sun-dappled paths, use your nose to follow trails, uncover secrets, make friends and expand your library of smells."</p>
<p>Reminds me a bit of the Shelter series. Check out the announce trailer below:</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is aiming for the 1.0 update in November with a new game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is a wonderfully chilled factory building sim that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/chilled-factory-builder-shapez-2-gets-a-massive-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a huge upgrade</a>, and hopefully in November it will be ready for the full release.</p>
<p>The developer put out a new devlog going over some plans which includes an aim for the 1.0 release in November, but they're not currently guaranteeing that date. That 1.0 update is planned to have achievements and modding support, along with a new game mode that might replace the current default.</p>
<p>For the new game mode they're aiming to address a common player complaint - needing to tear things down that are no longer needed. Their focus with the new mode is to make things more permanent, where the early building still has a place in the later stages of the game. Even when this gets added, the original mode will still be there but possibly renamed "Classic".</p>

<p>Even when the hit the 1.0 and leave Early Access, updates won't stop. They "already have a lot of plans and ideas for post 1.0".</p>

      <title>Palworld is now Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the latest updates to the popular Palworld, Valve have now bumped it up to Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>The rating has been a bit up and down with it going <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/while-palworld-enjoys-a-resurgence-valve-dropped-the-rating-to-steam-deck-unsupported/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsupported in January</a>, and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-set-palworld-back-as-steam-deck-playable-but-with-multiple-listed-problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back to Playable</a> a day later. Now that it's rated Verified, Valve appear satisfied it no longer has any of these problems below that they listed previously:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some functionality is not accessible when using the default controller configuration, requiring use of the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or a community configuration.</li>
<li>This game sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
<li>Some in-game text is small and may be difficult to read.</li>
<li>This game requires manual configuration of graphics settings to perform well on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>This game does not default to external Bluetooth/USB controllers on Deck, and may require manually switching the active controller via the Quick Access Menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they do note one issue it still has, which is that it doesn't default to external controllers on Steam Deck so you need to change the controller order from the Quick Access menu. Apart from that, it should now work well since the huge <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/palworld-tides-of-terraria-crossover-update-is-out-with-fishing-new-islands-a-new-pal-trust-mechanic-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palworld - Tides of Terraria crossover update</a>.</p>
