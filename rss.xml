      <title>It just keeps getting worse - Firefox to &#34;evolve into a modern AI browser&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/please-make-it-stop-google-chrome-to-be-reimagined-with-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Just like Google plan with Chrome</a>, Mozilla aren't sitting still on expanding Firefox into something resembling a web browser but with more AI.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> today on the Mozilla blog, they've got a new CEO with Anthony Enzor-DeMeo. Here's a short but important excerpt on the future of Firefox from the post (emphasis ours):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides how we build and how we grow. It means three things.</p>
<ul>
<li>First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.</li>
<li>Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.</li>
<li>Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. <strong>It will evolve into a modern AI browser</strong> and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>You should read the full post to form your own opinion on it, but regular readers will know my thoughts on AI quite well by now. Companies everywhere are scrambling to force AI into where it isn't needed, or wanted, and all it ends up doing is causing the complete enshittification of whatever it is.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to give us privacy and agency in how we use it, they would give us a very <em>simple</em> opt-out for all AI features. But like other companies and organisations - they won't, because they need to force people into it to make numbers go up. They say we should be able to easily turn it off, but I'll believe that when I see it as a clear option to disable it all.</p>

      <title>Vampire Crawlers from the Vampire Survivors dev gets a fun new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am seriously stoked by Vampire Crawlers that adds to the world of Vampire Survivors with a fast-paced deck-builder from developer poncle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/vampire-survivors-gets-turned-officially-into-a-crazy-deck-builder-with-vampire-crawlers-from-poncle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced back in November</a>, it's more of a casual deck-builder set in the same world as Vampire Survivors and will no doubt be another success for poncle. They've just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265700/view/583907108616931531" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> it already has amassed over 170K wishlists on Steam and they said: "So far we have published only what is effectively a hype trailer to try to convey how it feels to play Vampire Crawlers, with a few sneak peeks at many of the game features and options to snowball into unhinged chaos. So, for a first update, we are showing a new gameplay trailer and some simple and unedited gameplay footage of the very first dungeon floor, focused on basic gameplay. This should let you see what is at the core of Vampire Crawlers: have fun playing satisfying abilities in turbo turn-based battles, at whatever speed you prefer."</p>
<p>See it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SARs48njusw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/860044c220900d3baa68d058804de545.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SARs48njusw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</li>
<li><strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</li>
<li><strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really do love the look of this. Taking the pure chaos of Vampire Survivors and tuning into in a spin-off with a dungeon crawling deck-building focus. Excellent.</p>

      <title>Tingus Goose is completely absurd and possibly 2025&#39;s strangest game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tingus Goose has released recently and after being mystified by the demo, I took a look at the full game and I honestly still have no idea what is going on.</p>
<p>It's a clicker / idle game about growing a weird human-goose hybrid tree, one that spawns little babies called Tingis to help you earn money to continue growing your freak of nature towards the sky to mate with another goose. Once they've mated, your tree fully blossoms and explodes a whole bunch of new geese out into the world and you continue onto the next level.</p>
<p>It's so utterly bizarre I don't quite know how to properly explain it to you. Seeing is believing, and still wildly confusing. Not confusing in the sense of I don't know what I'm doing, the objective is clear to keep growing, I'm just confused on what goes through the mind of the creators when they thought this up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21223741571765891503gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21223741571765891503gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Tingus Goose is laughably nuts but at the same time it's weirdly captivating of your attention too, as you progress you just want to see more of it to see how batshit insane it will become in the later levels. And to appreciate all the little animations sprinkled into the game.</p>
<p>As you grow your freaky baby spawning goose tree, you get various growths (Blossoms) on the side that are various forms of geese with their own screwed up style and benefits. The key is to get the babies crawling and bouncing all over them as they fall down the goose tree to earn you more credits to keep watering that freaky goose to grow some more towards your mate up in the sky.</p>
<p>You get a sprinkle of upgrades as you go through it too. This system is also completely ridiculous. Below the ground are the roots, which get supplied with calcium from a cow. Yes, there's an underground cow hooked up to supply calcium and that's probably the least weirdest thing in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2051621061765892239gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2051621061765892239gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's here where you can spend bones to unlock permanent upgrades for you run. Like the ability to combine babies into screwed up abominations that earn you even more money to grow your goose.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a freaky doctor who will allow you to buy various extras using gems you find as you grow, that help you earn even more monies. You can buy up new types of Blossoms for your tree, DNA to upgrade your clicks on babies and more weirdness.</p>
<p>With it being an idle / clicker incremental game the main point is just to keep on going. With each chapter you start fresh with a new goose tree and the amount you need to grow gets longer, but you bring with it all the upgrades you've earned to keep things interesting and not even remotely difficult. It's a casual game that just takes time and not much else.</p>
<p>This is the good stuff right here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qZzyBRDIfds"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95dda987e676df64f19ead3a9ccfcc29.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qZzyBRDIfds" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Plant seeds in people: Pop a goose seed into a patient's torso, add water, and watch a towering goose-tree burst to life in MasterTingus's unmistakably twisted style.</li>
<li>Idle meets Rube Goldberg: Babies rain down branches, ricocheting off "Blossoms" to generate cash while "Specimens" chain wild synergies for exponential growth.</li>
<li>17 unsettling chapters, 150 plus unlockables: Every chapter introduces new modifiers, lore, Blossoms, Specimens, and Relics. All art is hand-illustrated by MasterTingus.</li>
<li>Each run offers a uniquely bizarre experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one issue running the game with Proton - there's a few brief animation videos that don't work on Linux / SteamOS where you end up seeing a <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1770843771765890818gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video test screen</a> due to the unsupported codec used by the developer. It's quite a common problem and you'll <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need to use GE-Proton</a> to solve that until the developer fixes it. Apart from that, the game appeared to run fine.</p>
<p>If you like games that try to be different, weird, unique and like nothing else but you also appreciate more chilled games — Tingus Goose is a seriously easy recommendation to pick up.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders gets a huge v1.7.0 free update with a new map condition, new event, skill tree resets and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Games have been cooking, with ARC Raiders v1.7.0 out now that brings quite a lot to the popular extraction shooter - so time for another run.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features for the game has also been added, with the ability to re-do your skill tree. You can also toggle to aim down the sights of weapons now too, useful to save a bit of finger ache. There's a cap on the amount of blue Cred you can have at any one time too, which is now actually shown in-game. We even get to customize our Raider Tool now too, they've improved Stella Montis spawns and moved the Aphelion blueprint drop from the Matriarch to Stella Montis. Also, one of my favourite changes - the Rattler is no longer completely useless with the clip size increased by default to 12.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zdGMteCqknE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b5f65ef609e01fcaf3c078c9aedd0ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zdGMteCqknE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">That's just the smaller listed above stuff as there's also:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Cold Snap map condition:
	<ul>
<li>During the Cold Snap condition, the clock is ticking. The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders - getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flickering Flames event:
	<ul>
<li>Gather Candleberries and XP during a run to progress through to earn various items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New free Raider Deck "Goalie" - coming on December 26.</li>
<li>New Quests and Items.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's lots more tweaks you can see all in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/cold-snap-patch-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Also, somehow Fanatical still have it on a discount so they're the best place to buy it.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft acquires March of Giants and the team from Amazon joining Ubisoft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon continue <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/as-amazon-cut-thousands-of-jobs-new-world-aeternum-will-see-no-more-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving further away</a> from making and publishing their own games, with them selling off the upcoming March of Giants and the team behind it to Ubisoft. The game isn't available yet, and only completed a closed alpha test earlier this year so it's likely still quite a while away.</p>
<p>What is March of Giants? An upcoming free-to-play 4v4 War MOBA where you play as a Giant, lead an army of soldiers and deploy tactical structures known as "Battleworks" on a ravaged urban battlefield.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19530500071765886202gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19530500071765886202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The terms of the deal were not disclosed but it's expect to be completed today, December 16th. From Ubisoft's own press release:</p>
<p>“March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas,” said Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and CEO, Ubisoft. “We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP.”</p>
<p>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,” said Xavier Marquis, Creative Director. “We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.”</p>
<p>Alexandre Parizeau added, “My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs.”</p>
<p>"We're proud of what our team in Montreal has built with March of Giants," said Steve Boom, VP of Audio, Twitch and Games at Amazon. "We're confident that under Ubisoft’s leadership, the talented developers in Montreal will continue to thrive and create amazing game experiences.”</p>
<p>Since the game is in development it's not clear if it will work on Linux platforms at release. It all depends on what anti-cheat they decide to use for it which has been problematic for Linux / SteamOS. Going by reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1924600" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from the previous testing, they had Linux completely blocked at that point but who knows what will happen now. You can take a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">look on our anti-cheat page</a> for more details on what games do work.</p>

      <title>Poly Bridge developer’s next game is Poly Bricks - a LEGO-like cozy, creative brick-building game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Riding the wave of more cozy games, developer Dry Cactus (Poly Bridge series) is working on their next game titled Poly Bricks that will come to Linux. They originally described it as a "cozy, creative brick-building game" that's "designed to capture the joy of building sets on your bedroom floor".</p>
<p>This was actually revealed back in June, which no doubt plenty of people missed (I certainly did). In the Steam forum in reply to a question on Linux support the developer just <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3449470/discussions/0/597408128295835601/#c842866071372416268" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this week said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Yes we do plan on having a build available for Linux (and Mac), we haven't gotten to testing other platforms yet but should be fairly easy to achieve</blockquote>
<p>See the original trailer below:</p>

<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build, design, and share — brick by brick.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assemble beautiful sets and unlock new designs as you progress through<strong> </strong>the different themes of increasing complexity.</li>
<li>Team up with friends and build together with real-time online multiplayer.</li>
<li>Let your imagination run wild with the Sandbox — design your own builds, optionally creating step-by-step instructions, and upload your creations to the Workshop.</li>
<li>Browse and download other people's creations on the Workshop.</li>
<li>Customize your library by importing custom 3d models for bricks and images for stickers to make your builds truly unique.</li>

      <title>The classic Plague Inc: Evolved gets a new free daily Outbreak Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Plague Inc: Evolved is a game about infecting the world by evolving a deadly global plague, and now there's new ways to play it.</p>
<p>A major free update just landed with the Outbreak Mode that adds in Daily Outbreaks, giving you the chance to see something new every 24 hours with different starting bonuses, origin countries and more. There's also new Unique Mutators that bring unique modifiers that will "fundamentally change both your plague and the world".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4930586371765884782gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4930586371765884782gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's such a strangely absorbing game. Just interesting to see how things spread, and cause a little chaos. Good fun if you're in the mood for a different type of strategy game.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>Features &amp; Additions</h3>

<h3>Balance Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mad Cow Disease Scenario: Reduced score requirement for 3 biohazards. Now need 50,000 Point and 30,000 for 2 Biohazards</li>
<li>Mad Cow Disease Scenario: Reduced randomness of Fish Event, allowing for more opportunity to infect islands</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>

</details>
<p>There is an odd bug in the game where a whole bunch of text may be missing which appears to be an issue with resolutions. The game started for me on the lowest resolution possible, and when switching to the correct resolution it didn't fix it. But a restart did. Something to keep in mind if you're going to jump in.</p>

      <title>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven arrives in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Massive Monster has revealed the exciting Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven DLC will arrive January 22, 2026 with a new trailer and more info. One of my favourites is about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p>
<p>Some more info they've shared about it includes the new freezing map condition requiring a mixture of special meals, décor and clothing to keep them happy. There's even a special hot tub party you can let your followers enjoy - oh my. All very seasonal with snowlambs to build, snowballs to throw and more. A bigger map too, which you'll need for all the new stuff. With the Woolhaven area you'll need to bring it back to life by clearing rubble and rebuilding shops, which will unlock ranching for your cult. There's two more dungeons to run through too and plenty more.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full DLC notes, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3><strong>Survive the Winter!</strong></h3>
With the introduction of Woolhaven, a chill will spread across the Lands of the Old Faith. The God of Winter, Yngya, will ask you to find the souls of Lambs passed, scattered across the mountain, and to return them to Woolhaven. However, with each soul returned, Yngya grows stronger - posing new challenges to your cult.

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your cult fed and warm</strong> - lest your Followers start to freeze! Special meals, decor and clothing will help.</li>
<li>You can even let your Followers enjoy a cosy little hot tub party!</li>
<li>Build snowlambs, throw snowballs, and enjoy the festive season with your Followers, who have new traits, quests and quirks to keep you entertained.</li>
<li><strong>Expand your base!</strong> There will be ample room for all the new structures and decor - like the Exorcism Altar, allowing you to reroll Follower traits, or the Work Tent allowing you to assign even more jobs to your faithful Followers!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bring Woolhaven Back to Life!</strong></h3>
As you play, you will be able to revive Woolhaven to its former glory, by returning lost souls, clearing rubble, and even rebuilding shops.

<ul>
<li>Unlock ranching - where you can ride, pet, tame and even harvest your adorable ranching animals.</li>
<li>Find and reforge legendary weapons!</li>
<li>Interact with the former residents of Woolhaven</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Explore and Conquer New Dungeons - Ewefall, and The Rot</strong></h3>
There are two new dungeons to explore in Woolhaven! <strong>Ewefall</strong> : the snowy mountain exterior, and home to Marchosias, the leader of the Free Pack.

<ul>
<li>The pack roams the freezing mountain side, determined to end all Gods (that means you).</li>
<li>Marchosias is a wolf of science, and he's found a way to harness the storms that plague the mountain to power his dark experiments. His wolves hunt as a pack, determined to end you.</li>
<li>Marchosias will <strong>never</strong> give up the mountain to a God. If you want it, <strong>you'll have to take it by force</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Rot</strong>: a grotesque mountain interior. A living, pulsing place full of vile and furious creatures.

<ul>
<li>The enemies in The Rot have been driven mad with pain and suffering. They will rip themselves apart to stop you, mutating and duplicating.</li>
<li>The Rot is a festering, burning place that corrupts all it touches - but what is it, and where did it come from?</li>
<li>Help an ancient dragon hatch her eggs, bring a monstrous garden to bloom, guide an old friend home (or take your revenge), and even lead a wayward moth to her sexy destiny.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>And in other news...</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We have been working on a brand new merch drop to go alongside Woolhaven, better than we have ever done before!</li>
</ul>
<p>Woolhaven arrives January 22nd, 2026 - and pre-orders start today!</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong to get a free expansion, Hollow Knight getting a refresh upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Cherry just revealed some huge news for both Hollow Knight: Silksong and the original Hollow Knight with some free extras on the way.</p>
<p>For the original Hollow Knight there's a refresh update coming, which is already in Beta and you can test it on Steam right now as per <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their post</a> it contains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br/>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br/>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br/>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br/>
- Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.<br/>
- Reduced Grey Prince Zote's stagger bounce height.<br/>
- Updated Sly's Great Slash collider to closer match visual.<br/>
- Salubra's Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.<br/>
- Map panning is now smoother<br/>
- Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They also note that with Proton you'll see a video test pattern, so to switch to the Native Linux version.</em></p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong meanwhile is getting a whole free expansion named Sea of Sorrow. Expect to find "New areas, bosses, tools, and more! Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year". We'll get more info closer to the release date as they want to keep plenty secret.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qDFEeeLy6ws"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b1aa22e8fc48f3d73f20bf6d12bc885.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qDFEeeLy6ws" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also revealed in <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the blog post</a> that Silksong has sold over 7 million copies. That's pretty incredible, but not unexpected given the mass hype around the game before release.</p>

      <title>GOG formally announce their GOG Patrons subscription donation system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As covered by GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gog-asking-for-more-donations-from-gamers-with-the-new-gog-patrons-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in October</a> when it silently launched, GOG have now actually properly announced the GOG Patrons subscription donation system.</p>
<p>This is a new way for super fans of <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> to directly support the DRM-free store with an optional monthly subscription. It gives you a few perks like Discord access, voting on priorities for the GOG Preservation Program, your nickname may appear on certain game pages, a special profile badge to show you supported it and behind the scenes content.</p>
<p>So this is very much like Patreon but for fans of GOG directly to help the store along.</p>
<p>To me, this only continues to show that GOG really isn't doing very well when it comes to revenue (you can see it on their <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/?report-type=periodical&amp;accounting-year=2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>). If I've read it right, GOG's net profit for the first 9 months of 2025 is only 910,000 PLN (approx $253,554 USD), for the whole of 2024 it was only 1,134,000 PLN (approx $315K USD) and that's down from 10,255,000 PLN for 2023 which for an entire store like it is really not a whole lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/page=10/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">We've seen before </a>as well how they were really struggling because the PC gaming default is very much still Steam. Earlier this year they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gog-asking-for-more-donations-from-gamers-with-the-new-gog-patrons-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">began to ask for donations when buying games</a> at the checkout too, and now this next big step.</p>
<p>Just look at Epic Games - they continue to be held up by Fortnite and even with constantly throwing out big free games they continue to burn through money because the majority shop on Steam. For two years in a row Epic Games saw a decline in purchases for third-party games (sources: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2024</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2023</a>). Other stores not only have to be different, but really need a hook to pull people in.</p>

      <title>Retro arcade-style rally racer Parking Garage Rally Circuit gets a DX edition with a lot more content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX has been revealed today, greatly expanding the content of this popular retro arcade-style rally racer.</p>
<p>Currently, the DX version is only available to play via the browser on <a href="https://wavedash.gg/walaber-entertainment/pgrc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wavedash</a>. A service that was <em>entirely</em> unknown to me until the press email came in. With Parking Garage Rally Circuit getting Parking Garage Rally Circuit <em>DX</em> as a DLC on Steam next year. I imagine most people will simply wait for the Steam DLC in 2026, rather than pay to play the game in the browser and have pretty much zero ownership at all and have an internet connection required. At least with things like GeForce NOW - the games are still <em>yours</em> (as much as the licensing argument allows me to say they're yours - you know what I mean). <em>Wavedash reminds me of the failure of Google Stadia…</em></p>
<p>What does the DX edition have? The developer said it doubles the content of the original release with a new European Tour adding 8 multistorey car parks to drift through on top of the original 8 American parking garages to make a total of 16 tracks. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visit multistory car parks in Paris (Art Car Park), York (York Castle Car Park), Turin (Car Factory), Montpellier (Double Loop), Hamburg (Concert Hall), Copenhagen (Power Plant), Geneva (Parking Tour) and Naples (Cave Park) as you drift and boost your way to victory in the single-player mode, or against other players online. These locations are all inspired by real multistorey carparks, though the odd underwater tunnel or falling stalactites may suggest a touch of artistic liberty. Do it all to a full new soundtrack from The Holophonics, the band behind the catchy tunes that graced the original game.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mnNihcf_GQ8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9cc0d3df05e39cd1fd9b6c21a8bfc7d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mnNihcf_GQ8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"What started as the idea of delivering a little more content for Parking Garage Rally Circuit has expanded into what is effectively a whole new game that doubles the size of the original,” said developer Tim ‘Walaber’ Fitzrandolph. “I’m really excited that Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX is part of the launch of a new platform in Wavedash that reduces friction and complexity for players to discover and play games like mine. I look forward to coming back next year with more news on bringing DX and the European Tour to Steam and console players.”</p>

      <title>The incredibly complex sci-fi grand strategy game Terra Invicta has a release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that created the Long War mod for XCOM, the rather complex grand strategy game Terra Invicta now has a full release date.</p>
<p>Last time I tried to play it, I was completely overwhelmed by not just all the options but how complicated the game interface felt and I just couldn't get into it. As much as I wanted too, it was a bit <em>too</em> involved in every little thing. Even so, it seemed to run really well with Valve's Proton on Linux. </p>
<p>More about it: "After aliens are detected at the fringes of the Solar System, humanity fractures into seven ideological factions, each with a unique vision of the future, each vying for power among the world’s nations. Take control of Earth’s nations, expand across the Solar System to exploit its resources, and build space-faring ships to fight in realistic tactical combat."</p>
<p>They've now set a release date for 1.0 on January 5th. This brings with it a new 2026 scenario for modern day Earth, along with support for new languages including Czech, Italian, Korean, Russian, and Ukrainian. That's on top of masses of improvements they've been adding in testing builds recently like an updated tutorial and an overhaul of the UI. Perhaps I'll actually be able to understand it now.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor gets mid-game saves and CPU optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The excellent bullet heaven Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor has Patch 3 out now which includes the much requested mid-game saving system. We finally don't have to do an entire run in one go! <em>Something that really should have been there from the start don't you think?</em></p>
<p>Now when you play through it, the game will save any time you enter the shop for you to pick it back up again later which sounds ideal. On top of that it should run smoother across all systems too as they "Optimized bullet trail rendering. This reduces the CPU load in bullet-heavy scenarios" and there's some additional levels added to the upgrades menu so you have a little more to work towards.</p>

      <title>From Ruins – A Detective Adventure looks worth keeping an eye on</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Ruins – A Detective Adventure caught my eye recently with it's interesting premise and some pretty slick looking pixel-art for point and click fans.</p>
<p>An upcoming "new-gen" adventure game that combines "deduction gameplay with a gripping story full of twists and turns". Doing a little detective work you'll be gathering clues to establish connections, and get solving a series of challenging cases. Currently in development by DigiTales Interactive who also made the positively rated Lacuna – A Sci-Fi Noir Adventure and Between Horizons – A Sci-Fi Detective Adventure.</p>
<p>Have a look at the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l6q7Ie2Vvhc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e00627d07ac29934a08644496082c1f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l6q7Ie2Vvhc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're going the self-publishing route this time too. CEO Julian Colbus said: "Even though From Ruins is somewhat similar to our previous titles, it's a major, scary step for us from a business perspective. As you may know, our previous releases were published and partially funded by German publisher Assemble Entertainment as well as additional partners for the Asian markets. This time around, we are flying completely solo, which means that all the marketing, PR, and distribution work falls on us. Like for many studios who have taken the same plunge, this might end up being a do-or-die situation. If you care about us and /or our ability to keep making games, it's more important now than ever before to help us get the word out."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Although it's a classic styled point and click adventure they say it will have:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Modern conveniences such as tight movement controls, gamepad support, and an autosave system.</li>
<li>Contemporary game design that can get tricky but is never illogical.</li>
<li>Combines high-quality pixel art with state-of-the-art VFX and sound design.</li>
<li>Tells a fast-paced story that respects your time.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The results are in - Bullet Heaven moves forward to be an official genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The results are in, game developers look to move forward to create Bullet Heaven as an official genre spawned from Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>You know it by now I'm sure — all these survivor-like reverse bullet hell games that appeared rapidly over the last few years. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a> that started it now there's the likes of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brotato</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2163330/Yet_Another_Zombie_Survivors/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Yet Another Zombie Survivors</a> (from Awesome Games Studio), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Megabonk</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2904000/The_Spell_Brigade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Spell Brigade</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922410/Achilles_Survivor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Achilles: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2066020/Soulstone_Survivors/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Soulstone Survivors</a> and no doubt <em>tons</em> you've never heard of.</p>
<p>I've covered quite a number of them by now that you can see across <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bullet-heaven/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our own Bullet Heaven article tag</a> too.</p>
<p>Well, to settle on an actual name for this genre, Awesome Games Studio <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczuipvt1qjXbUKE55K4HJUKXJo2lz-i6AXOErwle-Yj3zLnA/viewanalytics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">did a poll recently</a> and after 8,023 responses the winner was clear, it's going to be <strong>Bullet Heaven</strong>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yVjG3oCstyo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ef5da1cba13afd11bd84cd3edd9de49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yVjG3oCstyo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now they just need Valve / Steam to get on board with the idea, and give it an official category like many others on Steam have. What you can do to help settle it once and for all, is add your own Bullet Heaven Steam tag to various games, which should show Valve there's a need for it.</p>

      <title>The popular Megabonk gets a mega update with new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>New content for Megabonk? As if I needed more reasons to load it up. The absolute indie gem survivor-like bullet heaven just got even bigger.</p>
<p>What is Megabonk? Riding the wave create by Vampire Survivors, it's a roguelike survival game where you must fight your way through hordes of enemies and bosses in randomly generated maps. It feels quite a bit like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/megabonk-is-risk-of-rain-2-fused-with-vampire-survivors-and-its-glorious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Risk of Rain 2 fused with Vampire Survivors</a>.</p>
<p>The developer said that this was supposed to be a Halloween update and is still named the "Spooky Update", but oops - they made it bigger and it took longer. So you can expect to see a new map, a new character, a new weapon, new items, new enemies and bosses and new challenges too. A whole lot to play through.</p>

<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">

<li>New Character</li>
<li>New Weapon</li>
<li>New Items</li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses</li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li>
<li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Balancing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.</li>
<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -&gt; 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -&gt; 1.5%</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Console</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>
<li>Type "help" in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free 3-16 player party shooter of teamwork and betrayal, Klaus Veen&#39;s Treason added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for the holiday period, Klaus Veen's Treason is a fun looking 3-16 player party shooter of teamwork and betrayal that now has Native Linux support. It's also free to play, so you can have a great time without spending a penny on it.</p>
<p>A social deduction shooter which seems like a really interesting idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Treason, the Don has been murdered! Innocents must find Clues to identify the Traitors before they strike again.</p>
<p>Each round, a small group of players become Traitors who must eliminate all Innocents. Meanwhile, Innocents work with the Detective and Doctor to expose the killers using the Clue Processing Unit.</p>
<p>Choose your class (Slim, Medium, or Heavy), master unique abilities and gadgets, and survive the betrayal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>The Linux version came with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1786950/view/523110495538905788" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> released December 12th, with the developer noting "The highlight of this update is native Linux support. We have ported Treason to Linux, which was quite more complicated than just hitting "compile" on the source code". The rest of the update was dealing with community feedback with fixing up issues reported.</p>

      <title>If you need a new retro boomer shooter check out Ctesiphon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released in November, Ctesiphon puts you in the role of a Galactic Bounty Hunter extraordinaire in a fresh retro styled futuristic boomer shooter.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this one was built entirely on Linux. The solo developer mentioned they built it over a decade using "C/C++, OpenGL, and open-source Quake mapping tools" with a custom game engine. Some more about the Linux development and support on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Made in bits and pieces over the course of nearly a decade by a single developer on Linux using C/C++, OpenGL, and open-source Quake mapping tools, Ctesiphon's custom engine allows for the game to run reliably on low-spec systems. It's built to withstand large firefights with dozens of enemies, hundreds of blood spatter and bullet impact decals, and piles of giblets and scrap as you blow the enemies apart into clouds of particles and debris.</p>
<p>Ctesiphon has been developed on Linux first and supports virtually all controllers connected to it. On Windows only XInput-compatible controllers are supported natively, but others will work fine with SteamInput enabled. The big exception is for the Steam Deck and Steam Controllers, these won't be natively supported on Linux/SteamOS until after release but in the meantime they should work fine if you play the Windows build by setting compatibility to any version of Proton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9156153651765795485gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's also Steam Deck Verified, although it uses Proton by default on Steam Deck due to controller issues with the Native Version that the developer mentioned some info about it in a previous Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3808730/view/501717042106204534" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA have discontinued Quake II RTX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quake II RTX released back in 2019, with NVIDIA using it to show off more ray tracing effects for their RTX GPUs but now they're done with it. It's still free on Steam and the project behind it is open source, but NVIDIA aren't doing any more with it now.</p>
<p>Noted on the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page is a message that it has been discontinued, and the GitHub repository has been archived. They did one small final release version 1.8.1 with a few fixes but that's it now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20260743471765795145gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it: "Quake II RTX builds on the work of Christoph Schied and the team at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who added ray tracing to Quake II to create Q2VKPT (in turn building upon the Q2PRO code base). NVIDIA has introduced new path-traced visual effects, has improved texturing, and has made dozens of other changes and improvements, resulting in an experience that rivals games created today, and pushes your RTX hardware to the limit."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terminator 2D: NO FATE from Bitmap Bureau / Reef Entertainment has released today to give you some retro themed action-platformer goodness.</p>

      <title>Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7 on Linux, D7VK has a 1.0 release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing more classic gaming goodies with the Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7, D7VK 1.0 is out now for Linux.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page: "A Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7, which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine. It uses DXVK's D3D9 backend as well as Wine's DDraw implementation (or the windows native DDraw) and acts as a proxy between the two, providing a minimal D3D7-on-D3D9 implementation."</p>
<p>In the release <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/releases/tag/v1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned how they consider it "production ready" but not everything on it is quite finished, but it's good enough to run a whole bunch of games properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19351272901765541763gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19351272901765541763gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured -  Clive Barker's Undying</em></p>
<p>Some notes from the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Why bother with D7VK at all?</h3>
<h4>The good (vs WineD3D):</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anti-aliasing / <code class="inline-code">D3DRENDERSTATE_ANTIALIAS</code> support (you can also optionally force enable it)</li>
<li>targeted performance fixes for bad behaving games (looking at you, 1NSANE)</li>
<li>built-in frame caps for games known to break at high frame rates, or simply over 60 FPS (which is, sadly, quite common in D3D7)</li>
</ul>
<h4>The bad:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A few missing D3D7 features, that I'll most likely add at some point in the future</li>
<li>General WSI wonkiness on Wayland</li>
</ul>
<h4>The ugly:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quite a few remaining bugs</li>
<li>A cursed design that by some miracle happens to work well enough in most cases</li>
</ul>
<h3>You'll still need to use WineD3D for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Earlier D3D and DDraw</li>
<li>Games that make use of cursed legacy DDraw &lt;-&gt; D3D7 interop (thankfully, it didn't turn out to be entirely all <em>that</em> common)</li>
<li>Its excellent general compatibility and feature coverage</li>
<li>GPUs that don't support Vulkan 1.3</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing to see what the open source community comes up with. </p>

      <title>Over 19,000 games have released on Steam in 2025, with nearly half seeing fewer than 10 reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how insane it is to be a game developer right now, we've hit an all-time high for game releases on Steam in 2025 and not many get seen.</p>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, we can see from their data that there's been 19,008 games for 2025. That is a <em>lot</em> of games to be launching in a single year, which is up from 18,558 games in 2024 and 14,111 in 2023. This is a reminder that developers are not just competing with new releases when launching a game, but <em>everything</em> on Steam with many older titles remaining incredibly popular.</p>
<p>Showing just how difficult it can be to actually get a game in front of an audience, of the 19,008 from this year, a whopping 9,269 games have 10 or fewer reviews. There is a slight silver lining here though, as it appears the number of games receiving at least 100 reviews have been growing over the years since 2020. It's a bit lower than 2024 right now, but that will likely even-out before the end of 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10867522751765534775gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It doesn't take a whole lot to launch a game on Steam. A little bit of know-how along with paying the Steam Direct fee which is about $100 / £73.99. After that, if you're approved, it's mostly down to developers and publishers to actually find a way to market their games and cut through the noise of hundreds releasing constantly.</p>
<p>As someone who follows the constant stream of releases, there really is a lot of pure junk getting released onto Steam. And, with the increase use of generative AI, that release counter is only going to continue increasing. I expect 2026 will be another explosive year on Steam. I even just recently had a press release enter the GamingOnLinux mailbox that proudly mentioned the game was "100% AI", which went quickly into the bin.</p>
<p>Leaving a review for a game you enjoyed is still one of the best boosts for a game developer. So something to keep in mind.</p>

      <title>Aspyr have indefinitely delayed Deus Ex Remastered</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After revealing the Deus Ex Remastered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/deus-ex-remastered-announced-and-arrives-in-february-2026/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September</a>, Aspyr faced a fair amount of backlash on the style of it and now it has been delayed. There's no date being shared for when it might release now.</p>
<p>They posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3131640/view/618811986201804985" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and across social media to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered.</p>
<p>We've listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes.</p>
<p>All existing preorders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we hear any more about a new date, we'll let you know. <em>That's if it doesn't get cancelled.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully they'll be able to bring it up to a standard that Deus Ex fans will love, as it would be great to see it done properly and bring new players into the Deus Ex universe with it. Perhaps they need to take a look at what Nightdive Studios have been doing with their many highly successful updates of older games.</p>
<p>The original trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the COSMIC Desktop Environment is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have today finally released Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the newly launched COSMIC Desktop Environment. Giving the team at System76 their own foundation to build upon and help make their hardware more tailored and unique, it will be interesting to see the wider reception for the COSMIC desktop.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not expecting perfection from the first proper release of COSMIC, but from the time I've spent playing around with it - I am quite impressed with what they've done. The way everything flows is quite nice. Although, I really don't like the big thick borders by default.</p>

      <title>Kitten Space Agency is the spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitten Space Agency is an in-development spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program from RocketWerkz that you can try right now for free.</p>
<p>It's using a crowdfunding model to pull in supporters via <a href="https://ahwoo.com/store/KPbAA1Au/kitten-space-agency" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ahwoo</a>, which allows you to try the game completely free without paying a penny and it's your choice to donate after if you feel it's worth it. With what happened to Kerbal Space Program 2 where we still don't entirely know what's going on but the game is basically dead, another developer picking up the torch seems like an interesting idea for fans of the original.</p>
<p>More about it: Kitten Space Agency is a space-flight game that turns real aerospace concepts into something you can learn, test, and explore. Built in Auckland, New Zealand by RocketWerkz, the project aims to inspire future explorers while giving players deep control over engineering, mission planning, and flight execution. KSA is powered by RocketWerkz's new BRUTAL development framework, designed to enable moddability, high performance, and long-term scalability. </p>
<p>A popular idea it seems even this early-on, with the developer recently announcing their campaign has crossed over $100K in funding from people. The project is led by DayZ and ICARUS creator Dean Hall, joined by Felipe Falanghe (HarvestR), original creator of Kerbal Space Program, and Stefan Moluf, former SpaceX flight software engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15911984681765477268gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15911984681765477268gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>"The support for Kitten Space Agency has been incredibly encouraging. We set out to try a more open way of building games and it’s clear people want to be part of that mission. Contributions through Ahwoo help us keep developing the project, but so does playing our other games like Stationeers or Icarus which help fund the work behind Kitten Space Agency. However people choose to support us, we’re grateful. It all helps us keep pushing this mission forward."  — Dean Hall, CEO of RocketWerkz.</p>
<p>The game in the current development build appears to work on Linux. I tested it adding the installer directly into Steam, and setting it to use Proton Experimental and it loaded without an issue.</p>
<p>One to keep an eye on if you love your simulation games.</p>

      <title>The huge Project Zomboid build 42 finally gets multiplayer just in time for the holidays</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow - that sure took a while! A year since the first part of build 42 released and just in time for the holidays, Project Zomboid build 42 finally goes online. You'll now be able to play with friends, or others online but the developers recommend only playing on whitelisted servers or in Steam co-op. However, the build is labelled as "unstable" still, you need to opt into the Beta for it.</p>
<p>The list of what has changed for build 42.13.0 that includes multiplayer is long, <a href="https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/88501-build-42130-unstable-multiplayer-released/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">really long</a>. That's not taking into account all the main features added for build 42 originally (which at this point is years in the making) that was basically more of everything and huge improvements across every part of the survival game. <em>Saves made before 42.13.0 are also not compatible.</em></p>
<p>Here's their little celebration video for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lYKS02PYF7E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4933dbfd4c5109e0735c6c00dfa71b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lYKS02PYF7E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the Linux side, Project Zomboid will do native Wayland support now too if available. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The Linux version will use Wayland if available and the -Dzomboid.wayland=1 JVM option is used.<br/>
  -- This required moving keyboard initialisation until after window creation, only when Wayland is used.<br/>
  -- Known issues: While testing Wayland, it does not seem to be enabled by default on Linux using Wayland. It is also not possible to enable it through any Steam commands, since the “Dzomboid” flag is only a jvm command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This build is Steam-only for now, they will put it up on GOG when it's ready.</p>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder with huge battles Songs of Syx gets a major upgrade with a focus on war</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rated Overwhelmingly Positive from users on Steam, war is the focus of a major upgrade that just arrived for fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx.</p>
<p>What actually is it? Taking inspiration from the likes of Rome: Total War, Caesar, and RimWorld with the solo developer aiming to create the most ambitious city state sim ever. You start off with nothing and build up from a tiny village into a huge sprawling city and eventually a whole empire.</p>
<p>Version 70 is quite the game-changing upgrade for the battles in the game with the introduction of spearmen and cavalry, and the AI has been improved to be a fair bit smarter too so a little more planning is going to be needed. The scale of this one is seriously impressive!</p>
<p>They also have a brand new trailer to accompany the release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ci4_cFT7yaQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bee9eef018bb80849e7a3f05b692de3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ci4_cFT7yaQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And additionally the developer update video to go over it:</p>

<p>The main update highlights condensed:</p>

      <title>Dog merging roguelike deckbuilder Dogpile is out now and it&#39;s wonderful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dogpile was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/merge-dogs-to-make-bigger-dogs-in-the-roguelike-deckbuilder-dogpile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of my absolute favourites</a> during Steam Next Fest in October, and as a surprise it released yesterday. Note: the developer provided a key to GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>This is the first collaboration between the co-developers Studio Folly and Toot Games, the audio design team A Shell in the Pit, and the co-publishing team at WINGS. A deck-builder where you drop dogs on top of dogs and they'll merge into bigger dogs. It's pretty clever how they've merged elements of Suika Game bouncy physics, with elements of Balatro and deck-builders into something unique. I just love all the tiny little animations on the different dogs, really helps bring it to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888640981765473608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888640981765473608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You play dogs, get a little money when you combine them and keep progressing to customize them with special traits and figure out game-breaking combinations. It can get pretty funny with the different traits on the dogs, especially when things get a little bouncy with the physics system.</p>
<p>Check out the developer feature below that went with the surprise release:</p>

<p>The game works great on Linux with Proton. Wonderful stuff and easily worth a purchase if you love your more chilled-out styled games. A lovely casual deck-builder.</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds is set for some big performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a recent showcase video, Capcom revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds is set for multiple patches that should bring some decent performance boosts. </p>
<p>Performance seems to be a constant problem for the game, even on a high-end PC it has been full of issues. Perhaps these upgrades might even make it just a bit closer to playable on Steam Deck too. As shown in the Monster Hunter Showcase December 2025 showcase video, a screen capture of their plans is below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16373718431765463979gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16373718431765463979gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Title Update 4 is due out December 16, so it will be interesting to see just how far those listed upgrades will push the game. However, Title Update 4 is the "final large-scale update" for the game outside of a few technical patches they have planned as noted in the image above. So they'll be mostly moving onto other games.</p>
<p>All that and more in the video you can view below:</p>

      <title>Paradox have hopefully fixed the Vulkan performance in Crusader Kings III</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the release of the Crusader Kings III: All Under Heaven expansion and free update, the Linux and macOS versions were problematic but it should now be fixed.</p>
<p>There were many reports of it, and it seemed specifically to do with the Vulkan API and it affected Windows too. As of the latest update with version 1.18.2 released today, the issue should hopefully now be solved. Noted under the tech improvements part of the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We now support Apple Silicon CPUs natively (ARM architecture) and that should give a nice performance boost for people using M1/M2/M3/M4 chips.</li>
<li><strong>Graphical performance of Vulkan under Linux and Mac is brought back to roughly before-update levels.</strong></li>
<li>Map graphics shader performance has been fine tuned and improved, which will help out mid-range graphics cards the most.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A whole lot more came with this update too including three hit musical tracks from CK2 Jade Dragon for everyone, and various new features and various other bits of free content including: new events, special buildings, Steam Rich Presence for All Under Heaven features, UI improvements and so on.</p>
<p>It's a surprisingly big patch for the game. See all in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/594042189388972086" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Talking point - what have you been playing lately?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome back, dear readers, to another community article for us all to have a little chat about what we've been playing recently. It's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/talking-point-what-have-you-been-playing-lately/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">about a month</a> since we last did this, so it's time to see how you're all doing.</p>
<p>Last time I was completely hooked on ARC Raiders, clocking up a current total of 135 hours. I'm at a point where I feel like I've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer, and so I've taken a bit of a break from it for a while to see how it evolves across a few updates. Very enjoyable though, as long as you don't mind the PvP where you end up losing your good stuff constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4227499901765462380gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4227499901765462380gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823858711765462379gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9823858711765462379gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now that I've kicked the ARC habit, I've been jumping into a few other games including the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sektori-is-absolutely-one-of-the-best-modern-twin-stick-shooters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truly excellent Sektori</a>. Mixed in with some Overwatch 2 for the new season and winter events, because family members love it. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/overwatch-2-with-season-20-has-some-very-annoying-crash-bugs-on-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Despite a brief hiccup</a> with the latest season, it continues running great on Linux.</p>
<p>I also properly tried to get into Fallout 76 with the partner recently too, but something about it just feels a bit off. I can't quite put my finger on why. I think, perhaps, I just enjoyed Fallout 3 and New Vegas too much that it doesn't do it for me as an MMO? More time needed to see for sure. Am I really missing too much if I skip over F76?</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments - what have you been playing lately?</p>

      <title>Open source XR runtime Monado 25.1.0 released with expanded hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monado is an impressive open source XR runtime that aims to support a whole lot of hardware, with a focus on great Linux support and version 25.1.0 is out now. If you're a true XR enthusiast this is one for you to check out, as you might see some hardware you have working quite well with it.</p>
<p>What's new in this release? Quite a lot! Highlights courtesy of Collabora:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Hand-tracking enhancements</h4>
<p>This release introduces support for the XR_EXT_hand_tracking_data_source extension, enabling Monado to distinguish between unobstructed and conforming hand-tracking modes, an important step for better controller-aware tracking and more robust multi-source input. Alongside this work, several drivers were updated to leverage the new roles, and long-standing quirks in hand-pose selection and orientation were fixed.</p>
<h4>Asynchronous OpenXR calls</h4>
<p>Another major milestone is the introduction of Monado's xrt_future system and support for the XR_EXT_future extension. This new async plumbing code prepares Monado for the next generation of OpenXR features that rely on asynchronous operations.</p>
<h4>More device support</h4>
<p>Device support also expands significantly in this release with new drivers for the Blubur S1, Rift DK2, and SolarXR IPC, plus improvements for the Razer Hydra, Vive Pro 2, Xreal Air 2 Ultra, and Fujitsu headset. The compositor sees important enhancements as well, including per-scanline timewarp for rolling-scanout displays and more robust swapchain setup. On Android, users can now scan and store Cardboard calibration QR codes directly from the Monado main application page.</p>
<p>Overall, Monado 25.1.0 focuses on improving reliability, modernizing internal infrastructure, and broadening hardware compatibility. All these enhancements continue the project’s mission to make open XR technology more capable, flexible, and widely accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See more in the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/monado-25-1-0-enabling-tomorrows-openxr-experiences.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/releases/v25.1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>I'll admit I haven't actually tried anything with Monado yet, but from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamvr-2-13-brings-a-whole-lot-of-bug-fixes/?comment_id=285480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous comments</a> on GamingOnLinux, you could see a good experience with it. Hopefully Valve will continue to improve SteamVR directly on Linux too, especially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Steam Frame</a> that uses SteamOS.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR Redstone arrives with AMD FSR SDK 2.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD today properly revealed and released AMD FSR Redstone with the AMD FSR SDK 2.1, bringing many enhancements to their upscaling tech. Currently though, there's no direct support for Linux. Most likely, we'll have to wait and see how Valve's Proton / Wine can handle the new tech.</p>
<p>They're only officially supporting Windows 10 and Windows 11 with DirectX 12, that and the main highlight features are still just for AMD RDNA 4 (AMD Radeon RX 9000 series) but they do say there's "analytical fallback modes for select features support RDNA 3.5 architecture and earlier graphics". With this they're also doing a minor rebrand to cut down on all the long names so instead of things like "AMD FidelityFX" it's now just all going under the "AMD FSR" branding.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new for this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Frame Generation</strong> - an advanced frame-generating solution that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate high-quality intermediate frames from two consecutive source images, interpolating the motion of pixels between the start and end images. The neural approach significantly reduces artifacts common in analytical interpolation such as ghosting and motion discontinuities.</li>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Ray Regeneration</strong> - a standalone, machine learning-powered real-time denoiser that integrates seamlessly with any game engine, enabling high-quality visuals by denoising inputs from ray-traced workloads. Requiring AMD RDNA 4 architecture graphics, it works best when combined with other AMD FSR “Redstone” technologies to transforming noisy outputs from ray tracing into a clean, coherent image.</li>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Radiance Caching</strong> - a state-of-the-art illumination cache designed to work in tandem with Monte Carlo path tracing to boost rendering performance. At its core is an online machine learning model that continuously trains on complex, multi-bounce global illumination (GI) on-device and in real-time. The result is richer, more immersive lighting environments that respond dynamically without the need for pre-computation or baking.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Factorio mod developer and Hooded Horse reveal new automation game Substructure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is going to be horrible for my free time. Substructure sounds like a real interesting entry into the factory building automation genre. Coming from the developer of the popular Factorio mod Ultracube, now going by Dubious Design and publisher Hooded Horse. With vertical layers, it's set to add some interesting design choices.</p>
<p>More about it: "Set on a rogue planet that appears at the far reaches of the solar system, players will be tasked with leading an expedition to uncover the mysteries of this interstellar interloper. Establish complex automated factories and production chains on the lush surface of this alien world, all to support further exploration below the crust. Players can also work alone or with friends as they build around intricate caverns, and exploit alien resources hidden beneath the surface, driving the light of industrialization to the very depths. What mysteries will awaken and what dangerous threats will emerge remain to be seen…"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwV_0_25zh8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adde8c5946758e2d24190d48da6b0b60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwV_0_25zh8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Dubious Design is building something that goes far beyond the usual factory-builder,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “Between the vertical layers, intricate logistics, and day one support for modding and co-op, this will be the last factory game you’ll ever play.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be happier to (finally) announce we’re working with Hooded Horse,” says Dubious Design CEO Michael Donoghue. “It was clear from the outset that we had a shared passion for these types of experiences, and together we’ll be able to make Substructure truly great. We could not have hoped for a better partner.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Industry &amp; Agriculture – Resource extraction and management, from humble crops to vital building materials, to rare minerals.</li>
<li>Factory-oh! – Automation mechanics that will let the fires of industry burn bright!</li>
<li>Multi-level – build programmable elevator shafts to explore beneath the surface, and adapt production chains to account for resources coming from other layers.</li>
<li>Constant Innovation – use the materials found below the ground to improve processes on the surface. </li>
<li>Multiplayer – play solo or with friends in co-op! </li>
<li>Mod Support – From day one, add new resources, buildings, or just balance the game as desired! This game is built by modders, for modders.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Social stealth narrative game Better Than Us is all about creating a web of lies to steal from the ultra-rich</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><!-- squire -->A political social stealth narrative game about lying and stealing from the ultra-wealthy? Better Than Us certainly sounds like a game for the times. Sitting somewhere between a point and click adventure and a visual novel, it has a really great style to it.</p>
<p>Developed by Little Bat Games, who made the BAFTA-nominated Vampire Therapist it's going to feature an all-star voice cast to keep you hooked in. Here's a little more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->Set in the year 2200, Better Than Us depicts a (not entirely absurd) future directly inspired by humanity’s past and present. The wealthiest people in centuries have created floating cities to insulate themselves from a worldwide climate apocalypse of their own creation, not to own mansions and sports cars, but to buy moral authority itself. And surprise, surprise: extreme wealth doesn't afford anyone a greater sense of morality.</p>
<p><!-- squire -->They might have stolen our future, but in <strong><em>Better Than Us</em></strong> the spoils of past plundering and pillaging can be stolen from them. Players will take on the role of a master thief and manipulator (and her rodent pal), infiltrating exclusive parties thrown by the ultra-wealthy in their floating fortresses. Rather than stealth or violence, players will use charm and deception to develop key relationships with a cast of bizarre characters corrupted by their own wealth. They’ll need to remember which lies were told to which people, weaving an ever-growing web of deceit that even an all-powerful oligarchy will struggle to see through. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LVUF2QlTa04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f2235f8dca1a559be58c62330e39f759.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LVUF2QlTa04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Looking to the past is a helpful way of examining modern issues. Not only is the historical record inspiring, but dead people are less able to sue small game studios," said Cyrus Nemati, creative director at Little Bat Games. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell Lies, Remember Lies</strong> - It doesn't matter what you say. It matters that you remember what you said, and to whom. Track your deceptions or watch them collapse around you.</li>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Voice Acting -</strong><em> Better Than Us</em> will include an all-star cast led by Sarah Grayson (<em>Hades II, Vampire Therapist, Gone Home),</em> joined by Cyrus Nemati (<em>Hades II, Vampire Therapist, Duck Detective)</em> and more.</li>
<li><strong>Sneak Queen </strong>- Navigate lavish parties in an opulent post-apocalyptic world, sneak into places you don't belong, and steal what the wealthy value most: their stupid expensive crap.</li>
<li><strong>History Echoes Forward</strong> - Developed in consultation with historians from Oxford, UC Davis, and the University of Florida, Better Than Us is directly inspired by the consequences of extreme wealth inequality through the past and present.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer confirmed it will launch with support for Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 2025 fundraising has been a huge success</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Absolutely smashing their goals, the KDE team have managed to have a huge success for the <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2025 fundraiser</a> that's currently ongoing. 70% of KDE funding comes directly from users, so it's essential to help fund the free and open source software that you love.</p>
<p>The current total at time of writing has managed to hit a nice <strong>€272,256.5</strong>. Going by a <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/12/06/this-week-in-plasma-better-hardware-support/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from developer Nate Graham, a whole lot of it came directly from the KDE Plasma pop-up that they added to remind people to support development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donate to <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KDE’s 2025 fundraiser</a>! It really makes a big difference. Believe it or not, the fundraiser has topped €100,000! And that’s just for the fundraiser itself; the yearly donation pop-up has also raised another €100k in just the past five days (!!!).</p>
<p>It’s kind of amazing. This money will help keep KDE strong and independent for years to come, and I’m just in awe of the generosity of the KDE community and userbase. Thank you all for helping KDE to grow and prosper!</p>
<p>If money is tight, you can help KDE by directly <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">getting involved</a>. Donating time is actually more impactful than donating money. Each contributor makes a huge difference in KDE — you are not a number or a cog in a machine! You don’t have to be a programmer, either; many other opportunities exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see this. I hope that 2026 will see KDE and the Plasma desktop continue to reach new heights. And with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a> launching next year with SteamOS Linux and the Plasma desktop mode - it's going to be a great year for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>I donated to KDE this year, did you?</p>

      <title>Get ready for another adventure with The Darkside Detective: Backside of the Moon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The lovely Darkside Detective series is set to expand with a new announcement of The Darkside Detective: Backside of the Moon. Coming from Irish developer Spooky Doorway and published by Akupara Games, there's no release date for it yet but most likely next year.</p>
<p>It was shown off during the 2025 Unity Awards Showcase earlier this month. Here's a bit more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detective McQueen and Officer Dooley are back from their sabbatical, and although they miss their midday mimosas and suntanning on the beach, crime never sleeps, and neither does McQueen (we’re prescribing him Melatonin, god help us it works).</p>
<p>Follow six never before seen cases, where our dream(y) team is back and more ready than ever to put the zing in Van Helsing although… this time around, there are no vampire stories... that we know of. Still, our heroes swore a vow to serve and protect so they will explore, gather, combine, point AND click their way through whatever comes their way. Keep an eye out for werewolves, cursed items, rituals, treasure hunts, and perhaps the most terrifying monster of all - rich people!</p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 with Season 20 has some very annoying crash-bugs on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 10/12/25 08:42 AM UTC - Blizzard actually fixed it directly in the game. Really great to see actual direct support like this. From the Overwatch <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/proton-support-is-broken-game-crashes-on-esc-chats-etc/992546/79" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> from developer Bee:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Hi all, apologies for this issue. We have released a patch that we believe resolves this crash. Thanks!" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2732921411765356111gol1.jpg"/></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Overwatch 2 has launched the big Season 20 update but unfortunately for Linux / SteamOS fans, it comes with some really annoying crash bugs.</p>
<p>Such is the way with live-service type games, where Linux clearly isn't a tested platform before updates are rolled out. Something that may cause issues over time with Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new upcoming Steam Machine</a>. However, as long as you <em>don't</em> do a few things you should be okay. The issue is that certain menu interactions will just completely crash the game. We'll have to wait for Valve developers to get a fix into Proton for the game to work properly again.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the bug report on Valve's Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7033#issuecomment-3634156013" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> the game will crash and quit if you do any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the chat and close it or press enter with it open (confirmed myself).</li>
<li>Clicking on a prestige tier in the new battle pass (confirmed myself).</li>
<li>Potentially pressing ESC during a match (didn't happen for me).</li>
<li>Clicking around in the Missions section of the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, stay off the chat entirely during matches and you should still be able to play. As annoying as that may be. I've played quite a few rounds and it will reliably crash if you try to interact with the chat box. There's also posts on the Steam forum about it crashing on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2357570/discussions/0/689743495770993552/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Linux PCs</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2357570/discussions/0/689743495770990967/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> too.</p>

<p>Hopefully we'll see a fix soon!</p>

      <title>Total War: MEDIEVAL III announced by Creative Assembly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creative Assembly recently held their 25th Anniversary Showcase for the Total War series, with Total War: MEDIEVAL III being announced. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/four-total-war-classics-join-gog-in-their-preservation-program-with-more-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG also recently expanded their Preservation Program</a> with some classic Total War titles and more are coming to GOG too.</p>
<p>As for Total War: MEDIEVAL III, it's quite some time away as it's only in the "opening stages" and sounds like it's going to be a <em>big</em> thing for Creative Assembly as a developer. Their full announcement on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been waiting a long time to say this: Total War is going back to the medieval era.</p>
<p>We’re in the opening stages of Total War: MEDIEVAL III’s development – pre-production, to be precise, meaning we’re still years from release. But this isn’t just another game for us, it’s the realisation of something we’ve dreamed about for almost 20 years. The Medieval series is one of the most cherished chapters in Total War’s history, and creating a true successor is a goal we’ve held close for a long time. Now, we finally have the chance to make it happen.</p>
<p>This next chapter will be both a tribute to its predecessors and a bold revolution for what historical Total War can be. The team’s vision is clear: to create the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox featuring our signature blend of grand strategy and tactical real-time battles. A game that lets you shape your realms, rewrite history, and immerse yourself in the drama and intrigue of the Middle Ages like never before.</p>
<p>Some of you might be asking why we’ve revealed it this early, and the answer is quite simple: we want you to come on this development journey with us. At certain points throughout the year, we’ll share behind-the-scenes insights and give you a closer look at how the game is taking shape, so you can see it evolve with us – and in some cases influence its direction.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a sequel; it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of this, they're also completely overhauling their game engine "Warcore". They said it is the most advanced game engine in the history of the franchise that will empower their developers "with powerful tools to make gameplay more immersive, dynamic, and responsive than ever before". They said this new game engine also opens up the possibility for console releases too, so hopefully this means some big gamepad improvements for future titles on PC as well (which could be great for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's new Steam Machine</a>).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qFKhUJTnC-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/195f3611e905bdaff02c2ff217e8aa26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While Feral Interactive have previously done Native Linux ports of their games, it's far too early to tell if they will continue to do so, as Feral seem to be mostly out of doing Linux ports now. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/total-war-pharaoh-announced-linux-port-from-feral-interactive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back when Total War: PHARAOH was announced</a>, Creative Assembly incorrectly listed Feral as doing a Linux port with Feral later confirming it was only doing macOS for it. I'm going to presume you'll need Proton to continue playing the Total War series on Linux at this point, especially if you want cross-platform multiplayer.</p>

      <title>War Thunder is getting infantry combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no, it's going to pull me back in isn't it? War Thunder is finally adding infantry combat to its roster of war games in a future update. Testing is due to begin this month, being spread across stages for an eventual full roll-out during next year as the mode is still under development.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they're taking some elements from another game they publish called Enlisted, with you controlling a squad. They said you control a single soldier, but you have "full tactical control over the entire squad" and they will automatically follow you and assist in all combat situations.</p>
<p>It will come with a new location that mixes infantry, ground vehicles and aircraft set in Eastern Europe. During the closed beta there will only be a Domination mode, with soldiers and vehicles battling for control over a few specific points. There will also be specific set squads to pick during the beta. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VMFy3GKtfVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc3fd0ecae6772d2b4f919ff965ea689.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VMFy3GKtfVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said the beta will be supported across "Windows, Linux and Mac, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles".</p>

      <title>Classic roguelike top-down shooter Nuclear Throne major update 100 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A lovely blast from the past of 2015, Nuclear Throne from the revived Vlambeer has update #100 out now with some major additions and improvements. Originally founded by Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman, nowadays Nijman owns 100% of the company after Ismail sold their part in it back in 2024.</p>
<p>Going back 10 years ago, Nuclear Throne was easily one of the most popular games in its genre. To this day, it's easily still one of the best too. Valve have also now given it a re-test and they've given it the green tick of Steam Deck Verified approval. It does have a Native Linux version, but Valve set it to use Proton 10.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11870694471765280170gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11870694471765280170gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights of it include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A thirteenth character: <strong>Cuz </strong>is not afraid to show his emotions, with a Cry ability that tears through enemies and projectiles alike. Oh, and he gets to carry 3 (three) weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Custom mode,</strong> allowing you to modify Nuclear Throne to your liking, create unique runs and challenges, and to get to know the game better than ever before.</li>
<li>New unlockable <strong>C-skins</strong> for every character (and new achievements for these).</li>
<li>Localization for <strong>15 languages</strong>: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, BR Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Turkish, &amp; Dutch. Tell your friends around the world!</li>
<li>The game now supports up to <strong>4 player local co-op</strong>.</li>
<li>Co-op reviving has been reworked and now works with Revive Chests.</li>
<li>Co-op Ultra Mutations have been slightly changed to work with 2-4 characters.</li>
<li>Reworked and re-organized the settings menu.</li>
<li>The game now runs at <strong>60+ fps</strong> (but 30 is still supported for the true believers).</li>
<li><strong>Widescreen</strong> support.</li>
<li>New side art and a new cursor.</li>
<li>Open Mind has been buffed a little.</li>
<li>Mutations and weapons in the HUD now show information on hover.</li>
<li>The GO button in the menu has been replaced with a cool little icon. This was done <s>to save money on localization</s> so that we could fit Cuz in!</li>
<li>We are now Steam Deck™ Verified.</li>
<li>Updates Mac build to run on 64-bit devices including Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Gamepads should work better, especially on computers with a bunch of them connected.</li>
<li>Community leaderboards site <a class="Focusable Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthronebutt.com%2Fdaily" target="_blank">Thronebutt</a> has gotten a beautiful overhaul!</li>
<li>Many more little fixes and quality of life changes that you might already know from the beta branch. Full changelog can be found <a class="Focusable Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYAL-Game-Tools%2Fbits-of-nuclear-throne%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FChangelog.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>We forgot to add any secrets. Sorry.</li>

      <title>Discord gets improvements for video on Linux PCs and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer team at Discord released a new engineering <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-december-8-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> yesterday (December 8th) detailing lots of fixes, along with some Linux improvements. As one of the most popular chat apps in the world, it's good to see their support of Linux continue to get better over time.</p>
<p>Scanning over the long multi-list of changes here's some improvements for us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue that caused Linux clients to display two titlebars.</li>
<li>Discord now supports hardware accelerated video encoding for AMD graphics cards on Linux through VAAPI, yielding almost twice the quality using less resources.</li>
<li>Go Live on Steamdeck is now faster with zero-copy encoding from Gamescope, making it possible to share the action with your friends without burning up your Steamdeck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest is mostly just a long separated list of bug fixes, along with an upgrade on Desktop to use Electron 37. Along with some other main highlights their team noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We've refactored our media upload client code with improved retry logic and added support for file upload resumption, so large uploads can continue if interrupted. The new retry logic is written in Rust and delivered significant latency improvements—around 15% overall, with mobile platforms seeing the biggest gains (21% faster on iOS, 10% faster on Android). </li>
<li>We’ve shipped a redesign of our Desktop User Settings. The goal of the redesign was to improve user’s ability to find what they’re looking for by improving the design language. Our metrics indicate this was successful, but please reach out if you have feedback.</li>
<li>We invested in some CDN configuration changes that dramatically improved video embed startup times. P90 latency improved 54% from 600ms to 275ms, and p95 latency improved 47% from 1,250ms to 658ms. This also fixed certain aberrant cases where videos could take as long as 40 seconds to play. Enjoy the consistent, speedy loads of video content.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Hytale will run on Linux PCs via Flatpak but Steam Deck will require more work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the first release of Hytale finally approaching, the developers are still working through getting it running on Linux and macOS. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/hytale-devs-confirm-they-are-working-to-bring-it-to-linux-and-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As covered on GamingOnLinux previously</a>, the developers did confirm they were working on both versions officially now.</p>
<p>At least now we know how you'll be getting it, with the developer doing it via a Flatpak which means you should be able to install it across many different distributions.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/1998020881499513243" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X/Twitter from Kevin Carstens, the Co-Founder and Tech Director for Hytale, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="RE: Mac &amp; Linux Support  We have finally removed the last library that was causing trouble for Mac and Linux support.  We are able to build for Linux now using flatpak. Mac builds are work in progress. There is more work on the CICD pipeline to host the files required for flatpak.  This is still NO CONFIRMATION for Linux / Mac support at launch but we are getting closer to that becoming a reality.  More in-depth testing remains, will keep updating as we move forward." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17979898501765278486gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And for those wanting to play it on Steam Deck, it may technically work since it will have a Linux version but may not feel very good right now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Thats a different story. Steamdeck may be technically possible but you still have the small screen size, gamepad controls and battery optimizations. We treat Steamdeck as a seperate platform in terms of development. We won't prevent you from installing it and trying but we need to do more work to really support it." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12592249441765278485gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's also no gamepad support at launch, but it's next up on the accessibility roadmap.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic becomes Team Fortress 2 Classified and arrives January 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer team EMINOMA have officially rebranded Team Fortress 2 Classic into Team Fortress 2 Classified, and they've set a release date for January 30th.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/team-fortress-2-classic-scrap-their-open-beta-and-new-valve-rules-likely-mean-they-have-to-change-the-name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in October</a> they had issues running a playtest demo that had to be scrapped due to technical stuff on Steam, and alluded to changing the name due to new rules from Valve. This was confirmed in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/512976676069574040" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> to announce the new Team Fortress 2 Classified name. Turns out sorting a new name when you're based on a Valve game is not a particularly easy or quick process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8399888661765276662gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thankfully, it's all sorted and should be out for everyone to play for free on January 30th.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>NEW-OLD FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode.</li>
<li>Use TF2 pre-release inspired weapons like the Nail Gun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.</li>
<li>Go on a rampage in Multi-Team maps, where GRN and YLW bring their unique (yet strangely identical) brand of violence to Arena, King of the Hill, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h4>NEW-NEW FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
<li>A chicken, or so we're led to believe.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's nice to see another company put their money where their mouth is. Lots of companies talk about openness and the like, but many don't bother to support all the projects they make use of. For Framework, it seems perfectly fitting for them to get on board with more open source with the nature of their modular open hardware.</p>

      <title>POSTAL: Bullet Paradise gets cancelled over generative AI with Goonswarm Games shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh dear. Goonswarm Games are shutting down after Running With Scissors cancelled POSTAL: Bullet Paradise due to the use of generative AI. <em>It's a bit of a saga this one.</em></p>
<p>I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/survivor-like-bullet-heavens-are-going-first-person-postal-with-postal-bullet-paradise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the initial announcement</a>, along with a follow-up update in there where Running With Scissors attempted to defend the developer. The backlash only continued, and eventually RWS cancelled it as per the statement GamingOnLinux was sent on December 5th via Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.</p>
<p>We’ve always been, and will always be, transparent with our community. Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don’t).</p>
<p>Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we’ve always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the POSTAL franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can’t wait to share more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a fresh follow-up statement on December 8th from Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following our statement on Friday, Running With Scissors would like to share an update. While we needed to cut ties with Goonswarm Games on Friday and state the reason for doing so, our broken trust, we still wanted to give Goonswarm the time and space to be transparent about what had occured.</p>
<p>After sharing <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a tweet</a> on Friday that got more than 8.5 million views which denied they had used generative A.I. and were closing the studio, on Saturday, Goonswarm Games issued a <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow-up tweet</a> acknowledging the use of generative A.I. and apologizing. We wish them all the best as we both move forward in our seperate ways.</p>
<p>Running With Scissors has always operated with an unwavering commitment to the truth and transparency. We look forward to continuing to support our fans and expand on the <em>POSTAL</em> universe played by millions.</p>

      <title>Netflix want to acquire Warner Bros. but they have to fight off Paramount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While I was off running around the woods for the weekend, Netflix announced their intention to acquire Warner Bros. but now Paramount want to fight.</p>
<p>In the original press release from <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Netflix</a> they said it will be for a total value of around $82.7 billion at $27.75 per WBD share. This deal would include its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO, and their game studios too. What it wouldn't include is WBD’s Global Networks division, which was due to be spun off into its own thing. The deal is not actually done, as it has to go through all the usual regulator approvals.</p>
<p>Another wonderful bit of consolidation isn't it? Well, perhaps, but not if Paramount get their way. As they've <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">launched</a> a rival bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. <em>including</em> the Global Networks segment. They're offering more too at $30.00 per share in cash which they said is "$18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration".</p>
<p>Interestingly, Paramount say they actually submitted six proposal over the course of 12 weeks but "WBD never engaged meaningfully" and so Paramount has "taken its offer directly to WBD shareholders and its Board of Directors to ensure they have the opportunity to pursue this clearly superior alternative".</p>
<p>Time to get your popcorn out.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-26 released with FEX included, improvements for DLSS and game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Windows compatibility layer GE-Proton 10-26 has released with a bunch of technical improvements, along with various game fixes too. Check out <a class="gol140 gol149 gol576 gol691 gol902" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and <a class="gol146 gol383 gol519 gol578 gol921" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. <em>You generally only need it for very specific games as it's best to stick with Valve's official Proton.</em></p>
<p>Here's everything that's new and improved for GE-Proton 10-26</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes imported for upstream proton</li>
<li>changes imported for upstream build environment</li>
<li>changes imported for upstream lsteamclient</li>
<li>changes imported for upstream steamvr</li>

<li>ffxvi (16) crash with wayland enabled fixed</li>
<li>DLSS Scaling now available</li>
<li>add PROTON_DLSS_INDICATOR to enable DLSS hud</li>

<li>docs: Update Readme for scaling _UPGRADE variables:</li>
</ul>
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
<blockquote>
<p>fsr4 PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE Automatically download amdxcffx64.dll and upgrade games with FSR 3.1 to use FSR 4. Version to download can be specified by supplying it as a value, like so PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE="4.0.1", instead of 1. Downloads version 4.0.2 of the required DLL by default. This option also disables AMD Anti-Lag 2 currently due to various issues.</p>
<p>fsr4hud PROTON_FSR4_INDICATOR Enable the FSR4 watermark at the top left portion of the screen.</p>
<p>fsr4rdna3 PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE Identical to PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE but for RDNA3 GPUs. Enables some required compatibility options and downloads version 4.0.0 of the DLL by default.</p>
<p>fsr3 PROTON_FSR3_UPGRADE </p>
<p>dlss PROTON_DLSS_UPGRADE Automatically download and use newer versions of nvngx_dlss(d|g).dll DLLs. Version to download can be specified by supplying it as a value, like so PROTON_DLSS_UPGRADE="310.2", instead of 1, to download version 310.2.1.0. This option also sets DXVK_NVAPI_DRS_SETTINGS to use the latest preset. If you provide your own config for it through this environment variable, your configuration is going to be applied..</p>
<p>dlsshud PROTON_DLSS_INDICATOR Enable the DLSS overlay at the bottom left portion of the screen. This is exactly the same as FSR4_WATERMARK=1</p>
<p>xess PROTON_XESS_UPGRADE</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 11 gets a first Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're on the road to the release of Wine 11 early next year with the first Release Candidate now available for the Windows compatibility layer. This is what Valve's Proton is originally based on, and so eventually next year we'll see Proton 11 too.</p>
<p>Now that this release is out, they will move onto a feature-freeze to focus on fixing up bugs.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The highlights of this <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-11.0-rc1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine 11 RC 1</a> release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 10.4.0.</li>
<li>Locale data updated to Unicode CLDR 48.</li>
<li>TWAINDSM module for scanner support on 64-bit.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-48-byzantine-labyrinthine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 48: Byzantine Labrythine</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Candy Cruncher</em> stands as an interesting piece of Linux gaming convergence, with it pulling on almost all of the major threads that defined the industry up to that point. The lead developer of the game was Brian Hook, who is best known for being one of the key architects behind the Glide API for 3dfx, but he would also find success working on both <em>Quake II</em> and <em>Quake III Arena</em> at id Software; founding Pyrogon was his attempt at a slower pace after being at the top of his field for so very long.</p>
<p>The Linux port was crafted by Ryan "icculus" Gordon, not long removed from his initial freelance work on <em>Serious Sam</em>, with the game also being one of the first titles to be picked up by Linux Game Publishing. Founded by retailer Michael Simms in 2001, LGP was an attempt to carry the torch dropped by Loki Software, and thus extend the shelf life of his Tux Games online store. So many people's hopes were tied up in this otherwise unassuming product, making it a shame it was but a mixed success.</p>
<p>Helping to set this tone early on is the CD-ROM, with the installer not having the right executable permissions set. To install the game you should instead download the candycruncher_new_installer.sh from the archived Linux Game Publishing website, as this will pull all of the relevant files off the disc as well as provide you with additional patches. A free <em>Candy Cruncher</em> demo can also be found through there, although for some reason it would never let me enter my name into the high score table.</p>
<p>The full version sidesteps this by just grabbing the name from your user account, but <em>Candy Cruncher</em> would still sometimes fail to initalize and then hang before reaching full screen mode. These hitches would prove to be sporadic for me however, with the port otherwise demonstrating itself to be solid. What bothered me more was how the demo lied to me by claiming you will get to choose your starting level; instead, you can choose from starting blocks of about four levels each capped at level 22.</p>
<p>This forces you to replay levels that you have already solved over and over, and only seems to be done as means to artificially increase the game's difficulty. Casual games can be challenging, but they should not be frustrating, and it feels like Brian Hook was not far enough removed from <em>Quake</em> to realize this. In fairness he was always hesitant about the implementation of a time limit, but the blaring alarms in the game are far from relaxing, even if you can turn the sound effect itself off in the options.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11853055291765272153gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11853055291765272153gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9309219731765272154gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9309219731765272154gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Candy Cruncher</em> is at its best then when you treat it like Solitaire; just something you can launch to kill a few idle minutes before inevitably finding yourself stuck with a bum hand. When playing from the starting stage I usually make it to about level 19 before becoming boxed in, although when I was playing the game more studiously with the level select I did manage to achieve a high score of 769019 after coming close to solving level 27, which is about as far into the game as I think I am going to get.</p>
<p>There are a purported fifteen different candy types in total, so I have yet to encounter all of them, but the only real difference is in their appearance and in the points awarded. What differentiates <em>Candy Cruncher</em> from similar match-three games, other than the obvious fact that you match six here, is that you do not actually move the candy pieces themselves. Instead, you drag about the blank space found on the board, and use that to nudge the candies into line.</p>
<p>Wrapping your head around this is critical to mastering the click and drag technique required to get through the higher levels. While the game does support both mouse and keyboard controls, <em>Candy Cruncher</em> is optimized to be played with the mouse, and for a very specific technique in particular involving holding down and dragging the cursor that the developers themselves admit to being unintuitive at first in the supporting documentation.</p>
<p>The only real way forward is through trial and error, with there being enough randomness to the board layouts to make solving a stage often become a coin toss. The main strategies involved are recognizing when you have enough candies of the same type to complete a line, and navigating around the dreaded black jelly beans, fixed pieces that cannot be matched and exist solely to block your columns or rows. Candy canes can break these, or be used to match with any other candy type.</p>
<p>What promised to be sweet often proved sour, but Pyrogon was able to release one more title, <em>NingPo MahJong</em>, through LGP for Linux before closing up shop in 2003. The next installment will be the 50th part in this series, and with this in mind, I needed to choose a game that was both big enough and historically important enough to warrant that distinction. To that end, I present to you a true Linux gaming milestone: what may very well be the first big boxed Linux game to ever hit retail store shelves.</p>

      <title>Epic and Steam banned it but HORSES is out now on other stores</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Andrea Lucco Borlera / Santa Ragione, HORSES has proven to be a highly controversial title with both Epic Games and Steam banning its release. However GOG, Humble Store and itch.io have all decided to keep it. <em>Although, Humble Store briefly decided to stop the release they did actually put it up.</em></p>
<p>What actually is the game? Their explanation from the press details: "HORSES is a 3-hour first-person horror adventure set over fourteen days on a rural farm, where you work as a summer hand under a cryptic farmer and follow “a few rules” that unravel into increasingly surreal, unsettling tasks. As the sun sets and the facade of tranquility crumbles, you decide whether to keep to the safe path or venture into the farm’s hidden depths. The game blends interactive scenes with live-action intermissions, monochrome visuals, and silent-cinema title cards, with unique gameplay events each day. It's a game about the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility."</p>
<p>The situation with it is a quite confusing, and to explain it a fair bit the developer has put up a lengthy <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official statement</a> and FAQ. So far it seems both Valve and Epic Games have refused to actually clarify exactly why they have chosen to ban the game on their stores, making it all the more puzzling. Like many other games and media, it has some subjects in that some may find uncomfortable but there's plenty of games with <em>far</em> worse out there and live and Steam too.</p>
<p>The launch trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JYewjNYxV-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa72369cae1cf4bd50aadffd169a49bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JYewjNYxV-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is another case of issues with Steam keys too, as Santa Ragione say they were hoping to include their previous game Saturnalia in a game bundle. However, according to them, Valve have placed new rules on key requests too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam has recently begun refusing to grant developers keys for their own games. In the absence of clear rules or guidance, Valve led developers for years to believe they could request keys as needed, building communities and businesses outside Steam while still creating value for Steam users. It now withholds keys from indie developers who do not meet undisclosed sales thresholds. Our multiple requests for keys for our previous game, Saturnalia, were denied without any specific criteria we could work toward to resolve it. As a result, we have been unable to include the game in bundles we had planned to help recoup development costs for our next project, HORSES. This policy shift was never communicated and has been applied retroactively to existing titles. Developers and partners are understandably reluctant to speak publicly or challenge Steam, since as a de facto monopoly it holds disproportionate control over our business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not entirely clear what recent rule change they mean, as Valve publicly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3645136992388208760" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a> the rules way back in 2023 where you can see what changed via <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/bfa8ed111edc0ba6b963a0bb35f0c2de07d8cd58" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> to place certain limits.</p>
<p>Santa Ragione believe the removal from Epic Games and Steam, along with the above issue resulting in funding issues, may cause their studio to close. Hopefully it will find success on the other stores where HORSES is now available.</p>

      <title>Get some great Raw Fury games like Kathy Rain, Sable and more in a new Humble Bundle</title>

      <title>Guild Wars Reforged has arrived on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ArenaNet have released Guild Wars Reforged bringing together the Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns together along with various improvements. However the Guild Wars: Eye of the North expansion and the Bonus Mission Pack are still paid DLC.</p>
<p>Originally, they were aiming for it to be Steam Deck Verified, but that was quickly <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/29720/history/?changeid=U:70035202" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">removed</a> from the Steam description. It's rated Steam Deck Playable, but that seems mainly as Valve have yet to re-check it as the last test was back in 2022 for the game. So hopefully at some point Valve will retest it.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jXM-GkTvwnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43d92ac7176a72a093db0659b5d2c317.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jXM-GkTvwnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Stephen Clarke-Willson, the game director for Guild Wars, said, "The positive reception to the 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection reinforced our drive to keep this classic MMO thriving. As new players joined and experienced players rejoined the community, we discovered that people were playing on big-screen TVs and Steam Deck and other handheld devices, and so we decided to lean into supporting these playstyles fully with deep integration of controller support and big-screen TV support. Controller support has been a tough nut to crack for MMOs, and I think we dialed it in."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the original announcement of what's new and improved:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>The Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless mouse is a great reasonably priced pick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I decided to upgrade my mouse from a cheap unbranded USB wired to the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless, so here's my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>I've gone through multiple from Razer, a few from VAXEE and various other random brands including at one point being a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/im-now-a-true-convert-after-using-a-vertical-mouse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vertical mouse convert</a>. The problem - my old mouse was starting to come apart. I seem to have this same issue with any mouse I buy. The thumb grip on it was loose, it looked cheap and it started creaking too. All very annoying, so I thought it was actually time for something just a little bit better.</p>
<p>Here's the thing — I've felt like I've been just massively spoilt by wireless tech. I use the Steam Deck for gaming often right in my hands, with no wires apart from when it needs some battery juice, and if I'm docking it or gaming at my Linux PC - I use an assortment of wireless controllers. I've always felt like with a USB wired mouse that at times I'm just fighting the wire, and considering just how many hours I'm sat using a mouse, it was time to cut the cord. This will also help with my permanent wrist injury with it being a bit more free for movement overall.</p>
<p>Logitech are generally a reasonably good brand, so after some searching I settled on the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless as it seemed to have a good price point between not cheap and not overly expensive either. It also seemed to be light enough even though it takes one full AA battery.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12467640971764847162gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've now been using it religiously for two and half weeks and their claim of 250 hours battery life so far seems to hold up quite well. That's with me using it every single day, often forgetting to turn it off with the switch on the bottom at night and so far - I've not needed to change the battery. So I am genuinely quite impressed there given the vast hours it's on and in constant use.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Technical Specs from Logitech:</p>

<p>Thanks to the four solid pads on the bottom, it glides effortlessly over my mouse pad and really does feel nice to use. With a one-button click to change the DPI, by default you have a choice between 400, 800,1600 and 3200. For me 1600 is the sweet spot. Any concern with weight has gone too, even with the full sized AA battery inside there's no issues at all, I can barely feel it which is great for gaming on top of general work.</p>
<p>Noise level isn't too bad either. The left and right buttons do have a clear audible click to them, but not too loud that it's annoying. The scroll wheel is the real hero here though. Rolls nicely with your finger, with a clear bump at each level that makes things like quickly swapping weapons while gaming by scrolling effortless without accidental roll-overs.</p>
<p>As impressed as I am with it, there's <em>one</em> thing holding it back from true greatness. It's <em>too</em> smooth. Sure it looks good, and don't get me wrong it feels good. But it's just too slick, just a bit slippery perhaps even to hold. If it had a slight texture to the top and sides, holding it would pretty much be perfection.</p>
<p>When it comes to software, Logitech don't support Linux directly like a lot of vendors. But, open source to the rescue (as usual!). The <a href="https://github.com/libratbag/piper" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Piper app</a> can detect it, and configure the DPI settings on the button quite nicely!</p>
<p>At £59.99 it's reasonably priced for what you get, but it's also quite often on sale (I snagged it for £27.99). <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07CGPZ3ZQ" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a> has it right now for £34.99 or direct from <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/shop/p/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Logitech</a> for £29.99.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mining incremental inspired by Motherload, Dome Keeper and Super Mining Mechs with some added automation - Chipmatic looks like one to keep an eye on. There's a demo available on the Steam page so you can try it out early right now.</p>
<p>More about it: "Chipmatic is a factory building game where you control a mining robot on a mission to reach Earth’s core. Explore deep underground, research new tech and create the best (and only) factory on Earth! Can you discover what mysteries lie beneath the surface in this ruined planet some used to call home?"</p>
<p>Check out the demo trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6WF5Yt4wprM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34281d3345aeaf96a823ee33a4aa7b13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6WF5Yt4wprM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Go underground for coal, iron, and other useful minerals.</li>
<li>Refill your fuel manually, or by using your resources to create energy automatically.</li>
<li>Discover what happened to the beings who used to live here.</li>

      <title>Unreal Tournament 2004 is getting revived by OldUnreal with approval from Epic Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/epic-games-update-the-unreal-tournament-website-linking-to-the-free-downloads-from-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games did for the original Unreal Tournament</a>, they're giving full approval to <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 and keep it updated.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14432766771764843507gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Writing in the OldUnreal Discord, their team announced the upcoming revival of Unreal Tournament 2004. It will be available as a free download, with members of OldUnreal working to improve various parts of the game. Copied below is the original announcement from <a href="https://discord.gg/thURucxzs6" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! Some of you were probably wondering why we've been so quiet in the past couple of months. Today, we can finally reveal (part of) the answer: we've been working on a new side project!</p>
<p>With Epic's blessing and with the help of some new team members, we are bringing Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004) back. This means that we are going to publish an installer that downloads the original disc image for UT2004, installs the game, and applies patches to it. We are also going to start publishing patches that modernize the game, make it compatible with Windows Vista or later, Linux x86-64 and aarch64 (Raspberry Pi and similar), and Mac OS 10.9 or later, fix bugs, and implement quality-of-life changes.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. <strong>UT2004 will soon be available to download once again. Free of charge.</strong></p>
<p>This is a community-run effort but we’re excited to make the game easier to access and play again.</p>
<p>We have been working on this for quite some time now and have made enough progress to start inviting the first batch of testers. Highlights so far include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now natively support modern Linux and macOS systems with 64-bit Intel and ARM/Apple CPUs,</li>
<li>You can now play the game or run a server on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, albeit at a lower frame rate than on a PC!,</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions of the patch now include a fully functional UCC with an UnrealScript compiler (UCC make) and texture compression support,</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions now use SDL3 instead of SDL1,</li>
<li>D3D9Drv and fullscreen support are fully functional in the Windows 64-bit client,</li>
<li>We dealt our first (minor) blow to the editor goblin! We fixed several crash bugs, restored some broken functionality, and, most importantly, the editor will no longer freeze for several seconds when you click a viewport</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When can we expect it? Not for a little while. A public test version is planned "within the next two months" and they have some preliminary <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> up.</p>
<p>This is great. If you're not going to be doing anything with your classic games, you might as well let the community keep them alive. More companies should do this. Or, even better, just open source them - but one step at a time huh?</p>

      <title>The RAM price and availability situation is going to worsen as Micron pull their Crucial consumer business</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As RAM prices explode and availability becomes an issue thanks to AI companies, Micron announced their Crucial consumer business is no longer a thing.</p>
<p>Sent out in a <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> today Micron said they've decided to "exit the Crucial consumer business, including the sale of Crucial consumer-branded products at key retailers, e-tailers and distributors worldwide". Shipments will continue until the end of February 2026 - but after that, it's over as they will "continue to support the sale of Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial channel customers globally".</p>
<p>As for why? You probably guessed it - AI! From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,” said Sumit Sadana, EVP and Chief Business Officer at Micron Technology. “Thanks to a passionate community of consumers, the Crucial brand has become synonymous with technical leadership, quality and reliability of leading-edge memory and storage products. We would like to thank our millions of customers, hundreds of partners and all of the Micron team members who have supported the Crucial journey for the last 29 years.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucial did RAM and SSDs, so all of it will be going away from us lowly consumers.</p>

      <title>The response to s&amp;box from Facepunch going open source has been &#34;overwhelmingly positive&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open source rocks so it's pleasing to see it go well for Facepunch with s&amp;box. They've now added native Linux binaries for the dedicated server and game client. If you missed the open source news be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sandbox-from-rust-developer-facepunch-is-now-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder on what s&amp;box is — "s&amp;box is a game creation platform built on the Source 2 engine and our spiritual successor to Garry's Mod. Play, create, and share games, explore community creations, and experience endless sandbox fun with powerful modern tools."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4012086421764779748gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://sbox.game/news/update-25-12-03" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the developers noted the response has been pretty awesome. From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Open Source Response</h4>
<p>The response to us going open source has been overwhelmingly positive, in a week we've received <strong>over 3000 stars </strong>and<strong> over 80 pull requests </strong>and 30 already merged.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for contributing and being interested in the project, the pull requests have been great so far from small bug fixes to proper features. It's giving us a lot more momentum.<br/>
<br/>
We've been refining the repo sync workflows, GitHub actions now run formatting and unit tests on PRs, so any older PRs will need to update their branch to pass these tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Linux that also got a mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Open Source: Linux Binaries</h4>
<p>I've added native Linux binaries to the open source repo for enthusiasts to play around with, these are for the dedicated server and game client only. Source 2 tools don't compile for Linux.</p>
<p>These are not shipped on Steam as they're not usable yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if any proper Linux support expands from this. Fun to see though, and since it's open source anyone can try and do anything with it thanks to the permissive MIT license (<a href="http://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-public" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). But for now on Steam, you'll still need to run it with Valve's Proton compatibility layer. The game / game editor also isn't technically even released yet, it's still in developer preview while they build it up towards a proper Steam release.</p>
<p>More developers should do open source!</p>

      <title>Survivor-like bullet heavens are going first-person POSTAL with POSTAL: Bullet Paradise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 04/12/25 10:26 UTC</strong> - The developers are being accused of using AI generation for the game. There's been a lot of chatter across social media about it. In reply, the publisher Running With Scissors <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1996223528698273970" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on X/Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. We hear your concerns, and we can assure everyone the art in question contained no AI, being as real as Krotchy’s cojones. This was simply a case of misidentification. We’ve taken the step of substituting the art ahead of time to keep the focus on the new game announcement. For the curious, please see this video for the old art’s PSD layers: <a class="css-1jxf684 r-1loqt21 r-1ttztb7 r-1wvb978 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8wzEjmxRw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://youtube.com/watch?v=ed8wzEjmxRw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>2. “POSTAL: Bullet Paradise” is being developed by Goonswarm Games, a wholly talented team that we at Running With Scissors fully entrust and support as they embody the indie spirit we hold dear.</p>
<p>3. We are proud and excited to publish this upcoming bullet-heaven FPS and deliver to our longtime beloved fans a wild new entry in the POSTAL series that delves into its ever-growing multiverse!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the comments from the YouTube video ("Canceled Key Art Timeline Full Windowed") linked by RWS from the developer Goonswarm Games that's supposed to prove it's not AI, there's a lot pointing out <em>again</em> it looks to be made with AI. There's a whole lot on X/Twitter pointing out many flaws in the proof video too.</p>
<p>I've reached out directly to ask for more information on what's going on.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Ready to go POSTAL once more? This time it's in a survivor-like bullet-heaven styled setting, because obviously every developer needs to be in this genre now. Not that I am complaining, it actually reminds me of the time it felt like everyone was attempting some sort of Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Here you get to suit up and cause some chaos as one of 11 playable POSTAL Dudes from different timelines. Each with their own starting loadout and perks as you blast through hordes of enemies. And, because it's a survivor-like, you will get cards thrown at you to pick upgrades to evolve your POSTAL Dude during a run.</p>
<p>It will be playable entirely solo but you will also be able to team up in online co-op with four players max. Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t16kZLZv_5E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d47dfe9e31a3ad0b2180760c43d8b211.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t16kZLZv_5E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “POSTAL: Bullet Paradise is all about releasing the essence of POSTAL and its signature gallows humor into an over-the-top and highly replayable package,” said Artem Korovkin, CEO, Goonswarm Games. “Equal parts irreverent and action-packed, we’re thrilled to partner with Running With Scissors to bring this dystopian slice of Paradise to life.”</p>
<p>“No way in Hell Mike J is going to Heaven,” laughed Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi. “But he’s definitely gunning for POSTAL: Bullet Paradise next year.”</p>
<p>According to the press release it will have Linux, macOS and Windows support at release in Q3 2026 and will be priced at $19.99.</p>

      <title>No Players Online returns after an &#39;unfounded DMCA claim&#39; halted sales for nearly three weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing yet again that the DMCA system is not fit for purpose, No Players Online launched on Steam on November 6 and then got taken down but it's back.</p>
<p>What is it? <!-- squire -->No Players Online is an expanded now-commercial remake of the free 2019 cult-hit that's still up on <a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/no-players-online-classic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. The story goes: buried among the files on the computer is a broken multiplayer shooter that seems to have been left running for years. As you progress, you will be pulled further and further into the rotting digital world that will twist your curiosity into an obsession as new secrets about the world behind the screen are revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1805232181764776997gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What happened? After launching on November 6th, sometime around November 13th the game was abruptly hidden on Steam. Turns out, a "former friend" of the developers sent Valve a DMCA notice. Thankfully, the situation has been sorted and the game has returned but the damage to their launch has been done.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recently, No Players Online was removed from steam for nearly 3 weeks right after launch following a DMCA claim made by a former friend. they claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. NPO was made completely from scratch by our team.</p>
<p>despite trying to clarify to them the past couple months that their allegations were completely unfounded, they recklessly filed the DMCA to steam without any notice, and the game was taken down on november 13th. we immediately filed a counter-notice, and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed.</p>
<p>we spent 2 and a half years of our lives and a ton of money making this game. we also have a lot of people who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. it’s crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form, and it’s been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone i considered a dear friend.</p>
<p>we sincerely apologize to everyone who was unable to purchase or access the game during the past few weeks. this situation has had a significant impact on us, especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us. we lost out on much needed momentum and revenue right after the release of our game and we’re unsure if we will be able to recover financially from this given our already thin margins.</p>
<p>we are committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online, but at this point we are unsure about the future of our studio. any visibility on our game at this point would be crucial, so if you want to support a little indie studio please leave a review on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">steam</a> and share the game to the internet. &lt;3</p>
<p>much love,<br/>
adam pype, the beeswax team and black lantern collective.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 file-size on Steam gets massively reduced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One problem with a lot of modern games is just how big they're getting, but HELLDIVERS 2 is about to massively shrink thanks to work behind the scenes. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios noted they pulled in Nixxes to help get it sorted.</p>
<p>They were making small changes across a few patches, but now the big stuff is here and you can try it out in a Steam Beta via the "prod_slim" branch. Right click the game, go to Properties -&gt; Beta and select "prod_slim" from the drop-down box. The result should be a reduction in installation size from "~154GB to ~23GB". What an insane difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16513124621764772857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How did they do this? By "completely de-duplicating our data". They didn't do it before as they were worried about loading times for players who still have a traditional spinning HDD instead of an SSD. Something they spoke about in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previous news post</a> to explain it a little more. But as it turns out, the difference is only a few seconds.</p>
<p>This will become the default for everyone once they've gone through feedback from the Beta to allow time for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>A big new update also just rolled out with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0</a> that brought with it the fun new premium warbond that has a minigun along with lots of improvements to the game overall.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s now an AI warning notice browser plugin for itch.io as well as Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer behind the useful <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/the-useful-ai-warning-for-steam-script-has-been-turned-into-a-proper-browser-extension/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI notice browser plugin for Steam</a> has now done the same for <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, and they've made it easier to use the extensions.</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux they mentioned the itch.io version is available as a native extension for Firefox and Chrome, or as a userscript if you prefer. On itch.io developers do have to tag their games as using AI <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/itchio-store-now-requires-ai-generated-content-disclosures-for-assets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since November 2024</a>, but it appears there's no actual notice on game pages at all, not even in the "More information" bit you can expand. <em>There is a specific category for AI games with a huge 26,328 tagged.</em></p>
<p>So hopefully this plugin will help any of you that shop across itch.io too. Here's how it looks which is very similar to the Steam version:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5528752571764771859gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Now you can't miss it.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned "Both extensions can now be installed natively in Firefox for Android. This was already possible with the userscript version, but now it's easier". And, additionally, you can even add it directly into the Steam client using <a href="https://steambrew.app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Millennium</a> and <a href="https://steambrew.app/plugin?id=788ed8554492" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Extendium</a> although it's not supported and not exactly clear if it's against Steam's rules.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">You can find it via for itch.io:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ai-warning-for-itch-io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Firefox</a></li>

      <title>Valve have been funding FEX to get x86 games on Arm Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It turns out that not only are Valve using the open source <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FEX</a> for the Steam Frame but they have been funding FEX since the beginning of it.</p>
<p>What exactly is FEX? FEX allows you to run x86 applications on ARM64 Linux devices, similar to qemu-user and box64. It offers broad compatibility with both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries, and it can be used alongside Wine/Proton to play Windows games.</p>
<p>Recently, the FEX lead Ryan Houdek wrote a 7 year anniversary <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> where in it they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone! In light of the recent product announcements using FEX, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate our anniversary! On this day seven years ago (28th Nov 2018), I landed the first commit in the prototype project that would eventually become FEX-Emu! I want to thank the people from Valve for being here from the start and allowing me to kickstart this project. They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense with the Steam Frame, since it will be using a Snapdragon processor - Valve needed a way to get traditional games and apps to work on it and not just those designed for it. Much like how Proton made sure the Steam Deck was a success and has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pushed Linux overall to new heights</a>, FEX should hopefully do the same for the Steam Frame and any other future hardware using Arm.</p>
<p>Unlike Proton though, which was based on the existing Wine project with some extras they also fund like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton, Valve was there for the formation of FEX.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton is also something where you could say we started it, but because it’s a derivative of Wine, it’s less clear-cut. Whereas Fex, we were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts. We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't go expecting a Steam Phone any time soon though it sounds like they're happy with living room, handheld, and desktop. But, since FEX is open source people are already using it to get Windows games running on phones.</p>
<p>It's all about giving options and removing barriers, so that you will hopefully eventually get the same experience across x86 and Arm for gaming thanks to the likes of Proton, FEX and other open source projects that Valve fund. We all benefit from it thanks to it all being open source.</p>

      <title>Half-Life Legacy arrives December 12 but you&#39;ll need Proton on Linux due to Native Linux issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life Legacy is an enhanced fan mod of Valve's original shooter and it's releasing December 12th. The developers claim it is the "ultimate restoration for the legendary title". It comes with full controller support, achievements, speedrunning, dynamic weapon lighting, Steam Workshop support, Rich Presence for Steam &amp; Discord and much more.</p>
<p>The developers noted they've been trying to sort out a Native Linux version, but they've been facing some problems with it. As <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3619040/announcements/detail/538871739033060374" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also have important news to share regarding the <strong>Linux</strong> version of the game. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have been unable to port <em>Half-Life Legacy </em>to Linux, unlike <em>Cross Product.</em></p>
<p>Linux is a platform we've been targeting since late 2020 and one of the major reasons keeping us on it is Steam Deck playability. Sadly, due to a very strange issue we have spent many hours of our time diagnosing, we cannot release <em>Half-Life Legacy </em>with native Linux support. Despite this, the game has been tested via Proton on Linux Mint and Steam Deck (Steam OS) where it works with no major issues, so for now, Steam Play saves the day.</p>
<p>We will add native Linux support as soon as we can but this issue is not easy to solve. If you're confident with vague debugger errors and complicated issues, feel free to reach out to us via our Discord or a comment on this post, but I do warn you - it's not easy.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 44 will get improved NTSYNC enabling for Proton / Wine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NTSYNC has been available in the Linux kernel for a while, but it's taking distributions a while to actually use it - Fedora Linux 44 will make it easier.</p>
<p>What is NTSYNC? Arriving with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux kernel 6.14</a> the aim of it was mainly to help accuracy and performance for NT synchronization primitives when translating between Windows apps / games and Linux with Proton / Wine. As an eventual full and better replacement for the likes of esync and fsync. For plain Wine, it will be quite a nice boost - but Proton won't see too much of a difference in most things.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/NTSYNC-Contained" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new change</a> proposal has now been <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3510" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">accepted</a> for Fedora Linux 44 that will enable it when it detects specific packages being used - notably Wine and Steam (for Proton). NTSync has been available in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/wine-10-16-released-with-fast-synchronization-support-using-ntsync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine since version 10.16</a> but is not currently used by the official Proton (GE-Proton can use it).</p>
<p>Hopefully this will give gamers on Fedora a better overall experience with the likes of Wine.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 590.44.01 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first release of the 590 driver branch has arrived in Beta for Linux with 590.44.01 now available for those willing to give it a test. For those of you with an NVIDIA GPU that need the most stable experience, you should probably stick with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/nvidia-driver-580-105-08-out-now-for-linux-as-the-new-recommended-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">driver 580.105.08 from early November</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog provided by NVIDIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Raised the minimum supported Wayland version to 1.20.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the PowerMizer preferred mode dropdown menu in the nvidia-settings control panel from functioning correctly on Wayland.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported glibc version to 2.27.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of recreating Vulkan swapchains. This helps prevent stuttering when resizing Vulkan application windows.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.17 (video driver ABI version 19).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Dots Per Inch (DPI) to be incorrectly reported for some monitors such as the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9.</li>
<li>Fixed several problems that prevented Vulkan applications from working on Venus VirtIO virtual GPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause system freezes on PREEMPT_RT kernels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/258761/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></p>
<p>Does this Beta driver have a fix you've been waiting on? If not, what are you waiting on?</p>
<p><strong>Update 03/12/25 10:31 UTC</strong> - NVIDIA have updated their website so that Maxwell, Pascal and Volta are no longer listed in the Supported Products page for this driver. When the Beta initially released they were still listing them but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-confirm-upcoming-driver-will-be-the-last-for-maxwell-pascal-and-volta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as they previously announced</a> they're no longer supported in the 590+ series.</p>

      <title>Pixel-art RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent joins with MicroProse Software and it&#39;s now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now freshly Steam Deck Verified and with MicroProse Software backing it as publisher, TFC: The Fertile Crescent has a big upgrade out now. A pretty sweet real-time strategy game that's like a pixel-art version of Age of Empires, with an interesting food mechanic that will challenge even veterans of the genre.</p>
<p>Great to see the developer has pulled in some more support for this overlooked gem. Thanks to the new partnership update 1.3 brings translations for the game into German, French, Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Portugese (Brazil), Russian, Simplified Chinese and Spanish. On top of that the last bit needed (on-screen keyboard) was sorted to enable it to get Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s version of Android on Linux (based on Waydroid) is now called Lepton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lepton appears to be the new official name for Valve's version of Waydroid (Android in a Linux container).</p>
<p>We still don't have a whole lot of details about how this is all going to work, outside of Lepton enabling Android APKs for developers on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Frame VR kit</a>, but it's now that little bit more official with a proper name and even a logo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2808312871764672482gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>An interesting looking frog there. No doubt an in-joke from a certain Linux developer Discord server. As for the name, it seems to fit in quite well with the other compatibility layer Proton for Windows games on Linux. Seems Valve are keeping to a similar theme with their naming there.</p>
<p>Courtesy of SteamDB there's a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3029110/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">main page</a> and a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3056000/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">development version</a> with both actually having (rather blank) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202053950/https://store.steampowered.com/app/3029110/Lepton/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam pages</a>. I imagine the Steam pages will probably be hidden soon, just like Proton doesn't have an actual Steam page I doubt this will either.</p>
<p>We also saw that recently Valve added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamworks-sdk-adds-support-for-linux-arm-and-android-and-it-seems-we-know-the-first-android-game-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for Linux Arm and Android to the Steamworks SDK</a>.</p>
<p>It's definitely going to be fun to see what kinds of developers get on board with the Steam Frame, and perhaps even more exciting if we can get Lepton running directly on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS machines too. I don't really expect Valve to have it locked to the Steam Frame - but we don't know yet.</p>

      <title>Linux players on Steam hit an all-time high for November 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the statistics from the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for November 2025, which shows once again that Linux use is trending nicely upwards.</p>
<p>Slow and steady wins the race? Thanks in part due to all of Valve's work with SteamOS and Proton, and thanks to Microsoft forcing AI rubbish in Windows - more people are checking Linux out than ever before.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For November 2025 the overall operating system share is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - 94.79%</li>
<li>Linux - 3.20%</li>
<li>macOS - 2.02%</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a> is up to date for the Linux overall trend, as well as our newer distribution chart as well. Here's a snapshot from it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2143213141764660986gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2143213141764660986gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the breakdown of popular Linux distributions on Steam here's November's details:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 26.42% -0.76%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.97% -0.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.2 64 bit 7.36% +0.71%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 6.74% +0.73%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 25.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.96% +1.67%</li>
<li>Bazzite 64 bit 5.53% +1.29%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.29% -0.26%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 64 bit 3.86% +0.16%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.10% -0.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 1.96% -0.60%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 1.90% -0.03%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 1.90% -0.14%</li>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) 64 bit 1.58% +1.58%</li>
<li>
<p>Other 20.43% +2.39%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not entirely clear what Valve uses to sort the Linux list, as distributions seem to randomly flick in and out of it each month. Would be nice if we could just get a full list each month. The order has been all messed up for a few months too across various parts of the survey, hopefully Valve will eventually fix that.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 48: Byzantine Labyrinthine</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-47-before-i-was-born/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 47: Before I Was Born</a></strong></p>
<p>In my formative years it was accepted by most that the point and click adventure game was a dead genre. Sure, a handful were still being made, but more often than not these remained nostalgic takes hearkening back to the true heyday of the genre. Most devotees would instead stick to their old favourites, even in the face of mounting incompatibility challenges. These were issues that The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. would attempt to solve, starting with <em>Inherit the Earth</em> and <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em>.</p>
<p>First released for Linux in December 2004, both games were retooled to use the Simple DirectMedia Layer, but were otherwise kept as faithful ports of the originals for good or ill. For the <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> some audio improvements were made, but the only new addition was the "breadcrumbs" navigation feature that I never felt the need to use. Being built around the multimedia capabilities offered by the arrival of CD-ROM, <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> from 1993 is an arthouse first and a game second.</p>
<p>You can even play the game from the CD-ROM itself rather than installing it to your hard drive, although in either case I found I had to preload the libSDL-1.2.so.0 library included in the "common/lib" directory on the disc for it to launch. From here you are thrown straight into the game, with little chance to get your bearings. Vital tools I found for navigating the world included using the tab key to highlight interactable items as well as using the right mouse button to open your inventory screen.</p>
<p>With its age in mind I always figured I would need to consult a walkthrough, but I still gave the game an honest attempt at first; wandering through the hotel, mapping the mirror maze, and even reaching the ghost town of Revolver Springs before giving in. In the end it was the inscrutable user interface that foiled my progress, as while I did discover the drawer in the town jail which contained the brass key I required, the opened drawer then needed to be examined further to reveal the key inside.</p>
<p>The taboo of consulting the Adventurer's Guide now broken, I just went ahead and allowed it to lead me the rest of the way. The puzzles in the game are a means to an end, with the primary focus being to show off the 3D scenes and art assets created by Bradley W. Schenck. Playing <em>Freaks!</em> did show that I have an appreciation for exploring anachronistic worlds, but with only fixed images being used here to represent the four cardinal directions of any given space, I did find this harder to enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12242328631764659696gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12242328631764659696gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3581957381764659695gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3581957381764659695gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I have had some success coming back to old adventure games many years after using a walkthrough, and relying on my hazy memories to then solve them in a more organic fashion instead. Perhaps that will also be the case here, but <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> does play enough nasty tricks to make this seem a false hope. There are three separate instances where the game can be left unbeatable if you use a puzzle item too early, or if you fail to acquire a certain item before proceeding elsewhere.</p>
<p>One of these items is even hidden behind a door in such a way as to almost ensure you will miss it, with the significance of the item not being signposted in any conspicuous way. This lack of connective tissue is a real hurdle, and is the main Achilles heel of the game. While not exactly suffering from the "moon logic" that plagued so much of the genre, <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> lacks a driving purpose after Daedalus sends you on your way, with puzzle solutions holding little relation to their point of origin.</p>
<p>Keys are distributed at random, pulling levers will cause inexplicable events to happen elsewhere in the world, and your actions appear aimless without context clues to guide you; one event wherein the subway car becomes flattened even failed to happen to me as described. There are exceptions, including a clever conceit where you take advantage of the fact you have been taken outside the flow of time to alter historical events, but these highlights do little to overcome your initial bafflement.</p>
<p>None of this is helped by the smug presumption of the original developers, with them glorifying themselves in the backstory and teasing a sequel at the end. I think the game would have been better served if it was broken into discrete hubs, with more focus on the individual areas, and with the narrative being spread beyond just a handful of infodumps in a few key places. In the same vein is the soundtrack, with the music drilled into your head on an endless loop rather divided to accentuate specific spaces.</p>
<p>Much of <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> is just straight up mazes, only serving to underline the importance of the map screen; even with this aid I still failed to comprehend the surreal maze I blundered through right before the end. The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. did have plans to craft its own sequels, but have done little beside updating their initial ports for sale on digital storefronts since. The adventure genre would later advance through both ScummVM and the Indie game revival, but the timing was not right.</p>

      <title>Hytale devs confirm they are working to bring it to Linux and macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the revival of Hytale ongoing towards an Early Access release in January, we now have it confirmed that it will be coming officially to Linux and macOS.</p>
<p>Previously it was a case of them being "attempted" but a new <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> today gives us a much more firm statement with the developers saying "We are actively working to bring Hytale to Linux and Mac as soon as possible". That's great to see - official support! Hopefully it goes well.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Deck they said they don't have the ability to test it right now, and it won't be coming to Steam until "we determine our ability to comply with Steam's policies". Thankfully for the Steam Deck and other SteamOS machines, running third-party stores and software is quite easy as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a bunch of our guides will show you</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes into quite a lot of detail on the suggested system requirements for it. For the requirements it will be harder on your system for single-player, as it will run both the client and server it needs. This is what they're recommending at least for 1080p:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or equivalent)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16 GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrated:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Intel Iris Xe Graphics</li>
<li>AMD Radeon 660M</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GTX 900 Series</li>
<li>AMD Radeon 400 Series</li>
<li>Intel Arc A-Series</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deprecation notice:</strong> Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> SSD with 20 GB of free space</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 8 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more to it, I do suggest reading the full post.</p>
<p>Some previous full gameplay videos can be seen below if you missed them. Keeping in mind they are a heavy work in progress, the game isn't close to being finished after all the delays, cancellation and revival.</p>

      <title>GOG add the huge S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. as a one-click mod install</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. is a big mod for the already big standalone experience of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly and now easier to install thanks to <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>It's all getting a bit <em>complicated</em> in the Stalker world now so if you're a wee bit confused (I was) here's the basics: Anomaly is a standalone game <em>based on</em> the original series. It blurs the line between mod and fan game. <a href="https://www.stalkergamma.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gamma</a> (Gigantic Automated Modular Modpack for Anomaly) expands it even further but it can be tricky to install it all together where it works nicely. It's all free and now you can get it together in one neat package.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16390287861764608207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the Gamma website:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>A Zone That Evolves With You</h4>
<div class="section-content" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6="" data-node-id="147:101">
<p>GAMMA adapts S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly into a longer-form, higher-stakes experience. It encourages cautious exploration, smart inventory management, and tactical engagements across a world that's as deadly as it is dynamic.</p>
<p>With multiple difficulty presets, faction options, and curated progression paths, every run feels different yet always true to the heart of the Zone.</p>
<p>Thanks to its modular nature, every aspect that you want to change in G.A.M.M.A. can be easily tweaked in-game through the Mod Config Menu (MCM) or through ticking and unticking individual mods in the Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) instance it is based on. An entire discord community is ready to help you fine-tune the experience to your liking.</p>
<h4>Community-Built. Curated with Care.</h4>
<p>This isn't just a modpack, it's the result of thousands of hours of refinement and specific mods development from passionate fans. Designed to be stable, lore-respectful, and challenging, GAMMA is regularly updated and supported via dedicated Discord channels and install tools.</p>
<p>Anomaly was just the beginning. GAMMA is the test of your true stalker instincts.</p>

      <title>A retro Acorn RISC OS gem returns with Exodus: The Colonization of Space now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of gaming history returns to modern platforms with the release of Exodus: The Colonization of Space now available on Steam. Originally released all the way back in 1997 for Acorn RISC OS computers (an old British company), a name I've not heard in a long time - I'm sure we had an Acorn computer in my original primary school class.</p>
<p>Created by then-developer Artex Software as their first commcerial game, the founders of it would go onto creating Deck13, a name more of you may be familiar with as the developers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen. Artex have now returned too but as a publisher and Exodus: The Colonization of Space is just a little retro treat<em>.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZGP1Ld8u4c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4c52917bd4475c0586cb03129ded6a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZGP1Ld8u4c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pixely 256-color game focuses on founding a new civilization in space after earth was abandoned. The players colonize planets, deal with (or fight against) up to 14 computer opponents. They build up the surface of their planets, make laws for their people, trade with neighboring planets and fend off mean space pirates. There are turn-based battles, a science tree, and endless possibilities to build a pixel galaxy… or fail trying.</p>
<p>Exodus is a true retro game but has been brought into the 21st century with over 60 gameplay improvements and features like autosave and keyboard shortcuts. As it was originally released on the Acorn Archimedes, few retro gamers have ever played this little gem… Now is your chance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The re-release arrives with Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Arch-based distro EndeavourOS gets a new Ganymede release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best ways to try out a form of Arch Linux, the popular <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EndeavourOS</a> has a new release with Ganymede out now. Being careful with my wording not to attract the pitchforks from the pure Arch Linux crowd, EndeavourOS is <em>mostly</em> Arch Linux but with a simple to use installer and some packaging tweaks to make getting up and running simple with it.</p>
<p>So all the fresh upgrades you get from Arch Linux, wrapped up in an easy to use package. Now and then they release a big refresh of their ISO downloads, which bring various tweaks and now after some time waiting - their latest release Ganymede has officially arrived.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2906056391764602175gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2906056391764602175gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - EndeavourOS Ganymede</em></p>
<p>The live environment to play around with it and install it comes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Calamares 25.11.1.9-1</li>
<li>Firefox 145.0.1-1</li>
<li>Linux 6.17.8.arch1-1</li>
<li>Mesa 1:25.2.7-1</li>
<li>xorg-server 21.1.20-1 (xorg)</li>
<li>Nvidia-utils 580.105.08-4</li>
<li>KDE Plasma 6.5.3</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://endeavouros.com/news/the-long-wait-is-over-ganymede-has-arrived/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they say it has significantly improved support for NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the 50 most popular Steam Deck games for November 2025 - with Dispatch the winner</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's a fresh month and that means we can take a look and see what's been popular for players on Valve's SteamOS powered handheld the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A good chance to see not just what's popular, but also some ideas perhaps on what to pick up for your next game. Like November 2025's number 1 - Dispatch, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/i-have-finished-dispatch-and-now-im-at-a-loss-so-im-going-to-play-it-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I also thought was pretty amazing</a>. ARC Raiders is a new one this time, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which can run on Steam Deck</a> but you might find it's a bit unstable (and doesn't look very good). Another new entry is Where Winds Meet which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/where-winds-meet-devs-plan-improved-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">should be getting some Steam Deck optimisations</a> too.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi prices are rising due to RAM costs, plus a new 1GB Raspberry Pi 5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With RAM costs spiralling upwards right now, we're going to see increases to the pricing of lots of hardware - and now it's hit Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/1gb-raspberry-pi-5-now-available-at-45-and-memory-driven-price-rises/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from the Raspberry Pi team, to help soften the blow a new 1GB Raspberry Pi 5 was revealed at $45 / ~£43.20. For the prices that are increasing here's what they sent along:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Product</strong></td>
<td><strong>Density</strong></td>
<td><strong>Old price</strong></td>
<td><strong>New price</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 4</td>
<td>4GB</td>
<td>$55</td>
<td>$60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 4</td>
<td>8GB</td>
<td>$75</td>
<td>$85</td>

<tr>
<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>1GB</td>

<td>$45</td>

<td>Raspberry Pi 5</td>
<td>2GB</td>

<tr>

<td>$120</td>
<td>$145</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>They said the 16GB variant of the Compute Module 5 has also gone up by $20. However older lower-density Raspberry Pi models remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Right now the hardware industry just sucks for consumers in terms of pricing. A lot of it thanks to many companies increasing their AI workloads, sucking up all the hardware availability. You've likely seen some reports elsewhere on how 64GB of RAM is often now more expensive than an entire PlayStation 5. I checked that today and - yep, insanity. Lots of RAM completely out of stock, lots of them suggesting delivery would be in <em>multiple</em> months time.</p>

      <title>KDE Connect security advisory released due to possible authentication bypass</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Connect is a popular cross-platform app that allows you to send files across devices and more - with a security advisory being sent out due to a woops. Noted as CVE-2025-66270, that woops could allow an attacker to entirely skip proper authentication.</p>
<p>An overview of the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Versions of KDE Connect released after March 2025 implement version 8 of the KDE Connect protocol. In this version, the discovery of other devices with KDE Connect on your network involves an additional packet exchange between the two devices. While the first packet is used to determine if a device is paired or not, this additional packet is used to identify the device that is connecting.</p>
<p>The vulnerable implementations of KDE Connect were not checking that the device ID in the first packet and the device ID in the second packet were the same. This could be abused by first sending a device ID of an unpaired device which doesn't require authentication, followed by sending the device ID of a paired device in order to impersonate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vulnerable versions they list are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>KDE Connect desktop &gt;= 25.04 and &lt; 25.12</li>
<li>KDE Connect iOS &gt;= v0.5.2 and &lt; 0.5.4</li>
<li>KDE Connect Android &gt;= v1.33.0 and &lt; 1.34.4</li>
<li>GSConnect &gt;= 59 and &lt; 68</li>
<li>Valent &gt;= v1.0.0.alpha.47 and &lt; v1.0.0.alpha.49</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The KDE developers are suggesting you stop using KDE Connect until your Linux distribution releases an update for it, or to manually patch it yourself if you're able to.</p>

      <title>Piece by Piece is a sweet looking puzzle platformer where you literally connect pieces to progress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This looks absolutely wonderful! A puzzle platformer that takes things quite literally with you running, jumping and building your path from puzzle pieces. </p>
<p>Made by developer Neon Polygons with the open source cross-platform <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, it has a Native Linux demo available on Steam for you to try. I'm surprised I didn't spot this one until now, so perhaps you missed it too. There's just too many good games releasing and being teased all the time.</p>
<p>Have a little look at the demo trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ETp1hEq12Ks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16ebdabb3ceaf4c478277bedc1520cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ETp1hEq12Ks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Piece by Piece is a LITERAL puzzle-platformer where each level is fragmented into puzzle pieces for you to traverse through by stitching together the level...piece by piece. </p>

With its relaxing yet engaging vibe, Piece by Piece is perfect for puzzle enthusiasts and platformer fans looking to test out a unique take on the puzzle genre.</p>
<p>Explore unique themes that introduce new mechanics to test your logic as you progress from one puzzle box to the next. Portals, mining, rotating pieces and much more to discover!</p>
<p>Hybrid levels combine themes and mechanics into a single level, testing your mastery of each new mechanic. Can you make your way through all 100 levels? Make sure to collect the gold puzzle piece in each level!</p>

<p><em>A little confusing though, since there's also the game also called Piece by Piece coming from Gamkat / No More Robots. So one of them might want to change their name…</em></p>

      <title>UZDoom the successor to GZDoom has a first proper release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What will now be the main modern feature centric port for all Doom engine games, UZDoom has a first proper release out to take over from GZDoom. If you're confused on what happened with GZDoom - be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the previous GamingOnLinux article</a> covering the drama.</p>
<p>For people making mod packs and standalone games, UZDoom is probably what you want to be using going forwards. This small release is to get the ball rolling, while bigger changes are queued up for UZDoom 5 that will come later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17807159551764586566gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom 2 with UZDoom</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Changes from GZDoom 4.14.2 from the <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=81099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple security fixes. <strong>This update is being deemed as critical.</strong> It’s highly recommended to upgrade to it.</li>
<li>Anisotropic filtering is now disabled on Intel GPU devices if the texture filtering mode is set to any of the None options. This is to prevent texture filtering from being forced on when anisotropic filtering is enabled.</li>
<li>Added new game-based cursors (courtesy of Nash Muhandes and Xaser). These are much more cursor-y, and very good at pointing and clicking on things.</li>
<li>Changed defaults to be more balanced between vanilla and modern.</li>
<li>Lowered the master volume so it's less likely to blow out the system audio and become muffled (especially with things like the Plasma Rifle firing sound).</li>
<li>Added the Default option for automap colors, allowing the automap to choose based on which game is being played.</li>
<li>Added a Display option to control the render style of rocket explosions (these now default to additive instead of translucent since we felt it visually fit the other projectiles better).</li>
<li>Made the mouse less sensitive in menus when it’s been dormant for a short period. This should help reduce it accidentally shifting the selected option randomly while idle.</li>
<li>Added the <em>powerup_fade_scalar</em> cvar for controlling the strength of the fade on power ups (e.g. the Radiation Suit’s green tint).</li>
<li>Added support for the <strong>BUSY</strong> script flag for ACS.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not muting properly when the game is unfocused, causing it to build up and play back explosively in certain cases (especially for multiplayer games).</li>
<li>Fixed the master volume not properly applying to music when the game starts up.</li>
<li>Fixed weapon bobbing not disabling correctly when manually set to 0 via cvar.</li>
<li>Fixed the wrong music being played during Strife’s bad endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the opening subtitle for Strife not displaying.</li>
<li>Fixed the Iron Lich’s whirlwind blaming the wrong target for its damage dealt.</li>
<li>Fixed the textured automap being broken.</li>
<li>Fixed mid textures clipping incorrectly when skewed.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with VisualThinkers when loading from a save.</li>
<li>Fixed IQM models with decoupled animations not displaying correctly if spawned without an animation.</li>
<li>Fixed gun flashes from MBF21 weapons not displaying correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with <strong>CreateTossable</strong> where items wouldn’t be removed if their amount was 0.</li>
<li>Fixed Quat’s <strong>Conjugate</strong> and <strong>Inverse</strong> functions throwing a JIT error.</li>
<li>Fixed the BrokenLines class being unserializable.</li>
<li>Fixed level data fields e.g. Sector not being cleared properly when transitioning between levels.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Core Keeper set for a massive update in January with a new boss, automation, new weapons and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might be the most exciting update for Core Keeper yet bringing in loads of new tools and a big boss battle to the mining sandbox adventure. <em>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>You'll be able to jump in when update releases on January 28th, when it also arrives on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What's in it? A ridiculous amount by the sounds of it. They're not giving out exactly what, we'll have to wait for the patch notes at release day. Some of what they explained includes a whole new Beyond the Passage biome with a huge boss battle and brand new automation systems. Since there's new enemies, you also get new tools including: miniguns, mortars, grenades, remote detonators and even a flamethrower.</p>
<p>Loads more too so check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Hytale arrives in Early Access in January 2026 after being revived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being cancelled by Riot Games and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hytale-has-been-saved-as-hypixel-acquired-it-from-riot-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revived as an indie game again</a>, Hytale is now set for an Early Access launch in January 2026. Pre-purchasing will open December 13th, with it going live January 13th.</p>
<p>No doubt many are excited about this since it had a lot of followers watching it in previous years, thanks to its blend of a sort-of Minecraft style but more of a proper RPG. So a bit like Minecraft and Skyrim combined you might say.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer makes it clear this will be a very real <em>early</em> access, not like a lot of the early access styled stuff we see on Steam where the game is nearly finished. This will be "very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while" and they expect the "first impression will be rough". Still, it's going to be nice to finally see it out, and with the creators actually in full control.</p>
<p>Just over a week ago they also put up a nice long slice of gameplay too:</p>

<p>Are you excited for Hytale?</p>

      <title>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has another patch for Steam Deck and to improve performance for all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault from Digital Sun and 11 bit studios should run a whole lot smoother for everyone now, and feel better on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-enters-early-access-and-work-is-ongoing-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the last big patch</a>, another update has been rolled out that should be a pretty dramatic improvement to the feel of it overall. There's a fair bit more to the patch than just performance upgrades and tweak for Steam Deck but the highlights for you are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Big pass on stuttering. We’ve cleaned up a lot of unused or unnecessary data throughout the game. You should now see way less stuttering, and in many cases, virtually none at all.</li>
<li>Controls, performance, and menus are more Deck-friendly now, ie, Settings and Difficulty selection screen being easier to read and navigate.</li>
<li>Default Steam Deck graphics settings now use FSR3 – Quality instead of Balanced, for a sharper, more stable look right from the start.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again - it's great to see such dedicated support for Steam Deck / SteamOS. Always great to see, as a result it should run even better on Desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>

<p>More about it from the Steam page: "Dive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around."</p>
