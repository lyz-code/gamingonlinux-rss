      <title>Overwatch 2 becomes the worst user-reviewed game on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other developers like Larian are riding high with Baldur's Gate 3, it seems Blizzard are not doing so well with the recent Steam release of Overwatch 2 becoming the worst user-reviewed game of all time on Steam (via <a href="https://steam250.com/bottom100" target="_blank">Steam 250</a>). <em>Overwatch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/overwatch-2-out-on-steam-works-fine-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">playable on Linux and Steam Deck</a> thanks to Proton.</em></p>
<p>This hasn't stopped it pulling in plenty of players though, with it hitting an all-time high of 75,608 playing <em>just</em> on Steam 3 days ago according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. As I type this it still has 61,702 playing, so even though plenty of people are making themselves heard in Steam reviews - a lot of people are still playing it and likely enjoying their time with it. This puts it currently as the 15th most played game on Steam for peak player counts.</p>
<p>You don't have to look far into why the reaction has been so severe though. Steam gives players a real feeling of power thanks to the user review system, that certain other stores don't have, so it was expected this would happen due to the missteps Blizzard have made with Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>So what's happened?</p>
<p>Well it was supposed to be a <em>sequel</em>, but the reality is far different. Blizzard removed the original paid game, and turned into it a free to play version with the continuing live service model. Blizzard also cancelled the PvE content that was one of the bigger (biggest?) selling points of Overwatch 2. Now there is a small amount of PvE available in the Invasion update - but you have to pay extra for it.</p>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of the negative reviews are Chinese players too, since Blizzard <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/blizzard-entertainment-and-netease-suspending-game-services" target="_blank">ended</a> their agreement with NetEase which suspended their ability to play Overwatch and other titles officially. Now being on Steam though, Chinese players can make their voices heard (if they use a VPN to get onto normal Steam).</p>
<p><em>There's currently around 117,446 reviews on Steam with 106,596 being Negative.</em></p>

      <title>Check out this modern rewrite of the classic racer wipEout</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you remember the original wipEout? An absolute classic racer originally released 1995 for Sony PlayStation, DOS and later the SEGA Saturn. Now there's a modern cross-platform remake available to try out.</p>
<p>This wipEout Remaster comes thanks to developer Dominic Szablewski, who used the code leak from 2022. This does mean it's something of a legal uncertainty because leaked code could be nuked by rights holders at any time. Although, we are talking about a really <em>old</em> game no longer sold and supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12624739471692021213gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12624739471692021213gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the benefits of this remake include cross-platform support with SDL2, better memory management, better performance along with high FPS support, rewritten and upgraded physics and much more. There's still work to be done though with some features missing but it's very playable.</p>
<p>I have some really fond memories of playing the original on an actual PlayStation. Seeing it run in my browser, on a laptop is just - wow. I love how technology moves on and enables things like this, and I especially love seeing classics remade in such a way so more people can experience them and learn from them.</p>
<p>Check out the writeup from the developer <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2023/08/rewriting-wipeout" target="_blank">here</a>, the code is on <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/wipeout-rewrite" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and you can play it in your <a href="https://phoboslab.org/wipegame/" target="_blank">browser</a>.</p>

      <title>Latest trailer for Crowsworn has me desperately wanting this Hollow Knight-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowsworn looks like it's coming along nicely and fans of Hollow Knight will want to keep a close eye on it. Celebrating two years since their Kickstarter, they have a new trailer up.</p>
<p>About it: Explore a large interconnected world as you fight against hordes of monsters that roam the forsaken lands. Uncover secrets and unlock new abilities that enhance your arsenal of deadly weapons and powers. Venture forth to lift the ancient curse and unravel the mystery behind its origins, as you attempt to discover the truth and realize your salvation. Check out the new trailer below!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lwvx3ksnOQs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a21e21cac08082c53625fd9d0d06762e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lwvx3ksnOQs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not due out for quite a while though, and they won't be hitting their December 2023 plan as they posted in their latest Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mongooserodeo/crowsworn-a-dark-and-mysterious-action-packed-metroidvania/posts/3879584" target="_blank">update</a>. They said "In some of the previous updates we discussed that the game is going to be taking longer to finish than the initially planned for December 2023 release date. We shed some light on the reasons for this in the previous updates, but for posterity we'll discuss it again.</p>
<p>The delayed release is primarily a result of raising more than 10x the amount of funds we had initially planned for. This basically means need to make a game that is 10x bigger / better than what we initially planned for."</p>
<p>They're also working on a fresh demo.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614330/Crowsworn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel gets an AMD Zenbleed fix for the Steam Deck APU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One security issue I somehow missed back in July was Zenbleed, an issue with AMD CPUs that's getting patched up in the Linux kernel and now the Steam Deck is getting a kernel fix for it too.</p>
<p>Turns out the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=cfef7bbf0dca27209ea5d82d7060d4fc2c0d72ea" target="_blank">original code</a> in the Linux kernel somehow missed the Steam Deck, so now it's being pulled in urgently to ensure it's also protected as per the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/8/11/1138" target="_blank">patch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit 522b1d69219d ("x86/cpu/amd: Add a Zenbleed fix") provided a fix for the Zen2 VZEROUPPER data corruption bug affecting a range of CPU models, but the AMD Custom APU 0405 found on SteamDeck was not listed, although it is clearly affected by the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Add this CPU variant to the Zenbleed erratum list, in order to unconditionally enable the fallback fix until a proper microcode update is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we may see a SteamOS upgrade come in at some point, if Valve chooses to patch it.</p>
<p>I'm sure some people will argue against it as these fixes can come with performance penalties, because the Steam Deck is <em>primarily</em> a gaming device. But still, it has a full desktop mode it's not a traditional locked down console, you can install a browser and do basically anything with it - better to be safe than sorry. The Steam Deck is really just a handheld Linux PC.</p>
<p>More info on <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html" target="_blank">Zenbleed here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're on desktop, as always it's a good idea to ensure you regularly check for updates to patch up issues like this. Much like we <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/downfall-inception-amd-intel-security/" target="_blank">recently had for Downfall and Inception</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD RADV Ray Tracing to potentially get much faster on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some work currently pending to be pulled into Mesa, the open source AMD RADV driver could be about to get much faster with Ray Tracing which is exciting to see.</p>
<p>As noticed by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-Batch-Accel-RT" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> with the "Batch acceleration structure builds" <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24587" target="_blank">merge request</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This converts radv_CmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR to a simple shim that pushes the actual build commands to a queue, where they are accumulated and dispatched as late as possible.</p>
<p>This helps especially with games that don't do any build command batching of their own. For example, it triples the performance of Hitman 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in one of the comments from testing it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the perf uplift from this PR is huge in a few games, out of the ones I own lego builders journey gets a 2x improvement in performance. Control gets an additional ~5 fps at 1080p, Minecraft RTX (education edition) gets ~10 fps more. When paired with the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/21929" target="_blank">monolithic pipeline MR</a> it completely blows amdvlk out of water.</p>
<p>Tested on my rx6800.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if these two merge requests are pulled in, AMD GPU owners could expect to see a rather nice performance uplift in quite a number of games in later release of Mesa. So we could potentially see this in Mesa 23.3 due later on this year.</p>
<p>As a recent convert over to team AMD GPU with a Radeon 6800 XT, I'm going to be keeping a closer eye on stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: turns out this might not get merged into Mesa, as there's also an already <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/1651" target="_blank">merged upgrade</a> for VKD3D-Proton that does the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation that does some of the same as the MR noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Significantly improves Raytracing performance on RADV in a number of games, especially Hitman 3.</p>
<p>Handling WriteBufferImmediate is a bit janky as always, since we want to maintain correct command ordering with <code class="inline-code">BOTTOM</code> markers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either way, things are about to get speedy. Exciting! </p>

      <title>Heart of the Machine from Arcen Games dropping Native Linux for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcen Games developers of AI War, The Last Federation, Bionic Dues have said they're no longer doing Native Linux support for their upcoming game Heart of the Machine and will instead rely on Proton.</p>
<p>What is the game? "Heart of the Machine is a near-future sci-fi colony city-builder in reverse — you are the first sentient Machine Intelligence in an established world rather than starting from nothing. No one knows you exist (yet), and this allows you to operate from the shadows by manipulating the human population for whatever purposes your programming has in mind. The twist is that whether humans live or die does not determine your victory."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14054148691692014799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14054148691692014799gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This comes from a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001070/view/5467985516584106548?l=english" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a> posted on August 11th, where they mentioned they plan to get it Steam Deck Verified as they're routinely testing it and Chris from Arcen Games spends "about 99% of my own gaming on that platform these days. It's a priority for me".</p>
<p>So why are they dropping Native Linux and going with the Proton compatibility layer? They said they found it performs better with Proton, looks better, has better frame timings and so Valve "strongly suggested we ditch the native version in that case". Going into more detail on the problems with their Native Linux build in Unity:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Performance was 10% worse, and frametimings were less even, but it was certainly playable. This was just how Unity 3D works in Vulkan on Linux, so there was no way to solve it.</li>
<li>Certain parts of this game have geometry that is close together, and on Linux these would flicker. This is because Unity 3D does not support a reversed z-buffer on OpenGL or Vulkan (or DirectX9). This problem is not present in DirectX11+, or Metal. And it’s not present when Proton or WINE convert DX11 commands to Vulkan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, everything was the same on Linux as it is on Windows or OSX. We’ve had a native Linux build of this game for its entire life up until recently, just as all of Arcen’s titles have had a native Linux build for the last decade.</p>
<p>So this all feels very strange. But Unity 3D’s support for Linux, and in particular their implementation of Vulkan, is notably inferior to what is going on with their support for DirectX11 and Proton/WINE’s ability to bridge across.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4638641771692014805gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4638641771692014805gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They believe it's the best way right now for their games, because "If someone has an incompatibility, we can't change the engine" and that "Valve has been more on top of things than Unity".</p>
<p>It's due for release this year and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Rest in peace Dustin &#39;Crusader&#39; Reyes, a pioneer of Linux gaming news</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some sad news to share this Monday morning. A name I imagine a lot of newer readers won't actually know, Dustin “Crusader” Reyes sadly passed away (as confirmed on <a href="https://nuclearmonster.com/2023/08/dustin-crusader-reyes/" target="_blank">Nuclear Monster</a>) - someone who was a pioneer of Linux gaming news.</p>
<p>Dustin was a main contributor to the long-gone linuxgames.com website, which was one of the first proper websites around that tried to give people a place to keep up to date with Linux gaming. I was a <em>big</em> fan of the website, I read it every day so naturally I read the stuff Dustin put up often, and without people like Dustin there's a definite chance I wouldn't have continued reading and eventually start up GamingOnLinux. Even in the beginning of GamingOnLinux I contributed a bit to linuxgames.com myself, which Dustin and others would be approving and publishing.</p>
<p>From an old <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9907/01/linuxgame.idg/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> article where they spoke to Dustin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked Dustin (who sometimes goes by the name Crusader) how the Linux Games site got started. "Linux Games began as a venture of Marvin Malkowski, head of the Telefragged gaming network," he replied. "Marv had been a longtime Linux supporter, and thus thought it was only natural to add a site dedicated to providing quality news about gaming under the Linux operating system to the network. I had known Marv for a few months via IRC, and expressed an interest in being on staff. Marv also recruited Al Koskelin, and in May of 1998 the three of us took Linux Games public. Looking back, it's almost hard to fathom how far gaming under Linux has come in just over a year -- it's almost an exact microcosm of the acceptance of Linux itself by mainstream computer users."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I personally spoke with Dustin a number of times over the years, and he was always a really friendly and welcoming person to chat to.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Dustin “Crusader” Reyes, one of the Linux gaming news pioneers.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint planning new &#39;EDGE&#39; ISO, plus Linux Mint 21.3 due in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's some interesting plans ahead coming from the Linux Mint team including a new EDGE ISO for running Mint on newer hardware, info on the next Linux Mint release and their concerns with Ubuntu and Snap.</p>
<p>First up for fans of their LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition), it's still going and version 6 is code-named "Faye". With their plans to have all the features and changes from the main Linux Mint 21.2 but there's currently no ETA on when it will be available.</p>
<p>On top of that they've announced plans for a new Linux Mint EDGE ISO for Mint 21.2. The idea is to provide you with a download that has a fresher Linux kernel (6.2) for running Linux Mint on newer hardware. Seems like a sane idea, other distributions do a similar thing when refreshing their downloads. Not an entirely new thing for Mint though, they’ve done it for some previous releases.</p>
<p>Also the next main Linux Mint release 21.3 is planned for December, however they're likely to "reduce the scope" of it. While they have plenty planned they want to "prioritize some long-term aspects and dedicate some of our time to them" like updating their ISO production tools and fix secureboot. They're also doing some Wayland support investigation work. </p>
<p>Linux Mint's leader Clement "Clem" Lefebvre has also shown plenty of concern about Snap packages in Ubuntu, and it seems that issue has continued as they will be "keeping an eye on Ubuntu, their increased focus on Snap, the quality of their 24.04 package base and what this means for us going forward".</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A small update for Proton Experimental launched on August 10th for Steam Deck and desktop Linux to fix issues with two problematic games. Valve launched a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/proton-experimental-baldurs-gate-3-unreal-engine-4-intel-gpus/" target="_blank">bigger update only a day ago</a> so this is just cleaning up more issues.</p>

<li>Disabled dxvk-nvapi for Rachet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart to stop it from crashing on launch after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed Street Fighter 6 causing GPU hangs.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Celebrate QuakeCon and Quake II Remastered with this Steam Sale</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Earlier we reported about how id Software and Nightdive Studios had come together once more to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/quake-ii-remastered-shadow-dropped-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">remaster Quake II</a> for a new generation and shadow dropped it at QuakeCon. Well, that was only one part of the festivities as id and Bethesda have put a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2023" target="_blank">bunch of their hit games on sale</a> to celebrate QuakeCon, with games from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" target="_blank">Doom </a>to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/" target="_blank">Hi-Fi Rush</a> receiving discounts.</p>
<p>There's a lot to get through, so for the sake of brevity I'll just drop my recommended deals. Store links and Steam Deck status will be included to save you time:</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" target="_blank">Doom Eternal</a>: <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" target="_blank">Doom (2016)</a>: <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM_1993/" target="_blank">Doom (1993)</a>: <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported, but Valve just needs to get on re-examining that rating because it performs like it's <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/>Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/" target="_blank">Doom II</a>: <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/201810/Wolfenstein_The_New_Order/" target="_blank">Wolfenstein The New Order</a>: <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/Quake/" target="_blank">Quake Remastered</a>: <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank">Skyrim Special Edition</a>: <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/Dishonored/" target="_blank">Dishonored</a>: <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey/" target="_blank">Prey</a>: <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/" target="_blank">Fallout New Vegas</a>: <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable</p>
<p>I'd like to note my criteria for whether they'd be on this list is if I thought they were a worthwhile deal. That's why, despite being on the sale page, I didn't list either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/" target="_blank">Hi-Fi Rush</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2320/Quake_II/" target="_blank">Quake II Remastered</a>. I like both those games, but I don't think the discount was enough to overshadow the games I listed.</p>
<p>The game I'd recommend is probably <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/Dishonored/" target="_blank">Dishonored</a>, it's a meaty Arkane Classic for only 2 dollars. The runner up is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/201810/Wolfenstein_The_New_Order/" target="_blank">Wolfenstein The New Order</a>, it's the game that arguably kicked off this FPS Renaissance we're in now and is an incredible game for 5 dollars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2023" target="_blank">QuakeCon 2023 Steam Sale</a> ends August 16, so don't miss out!</p>

      <title>Survival horror deck-builder Draft of Darkness launches August 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together survival, horror, a deck builder and roguelike dungeon exploration - Draft of Darkness has a little bit of everything. Currently in Early Access the developer has now announced it will launch in full on August 23rd.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/draft-of-darkness-is-a-deckbuilder-like-nothing-else-with-a-horror-theme/" target="_blank">played a good bit</a> of the initial Early Access release and quite enjoyed it. Seems it continues to fly under the radar of most with only just over 100 Steam user reviews. It definitely deserves a whole lot more attention!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight infected creatures</strong>, government robots, and other survivors in an ammo-focused turn-based card battle system.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the post-apocalyptic city</strong> consumed by darkness. Each map is procedurally generated and unique with every run.</li>
<li><strong>Recruit a party of survivors</strong> to help you on your journey. Each has their own deck of abilities!</li>
<li>Trade to collect better equipment and cards, which you can use to strengthen your companions.</li>
<li><strong>Manage the darkness.</strong> The more enemies you slay, the darker and more dangerous the map becomes. However, Darkness brings rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Make important story-based decisions.</strong> Your choices are key to progressing the story.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has Native Linux support but there's currently no Steam Deck rating for it.</p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 out on Steam - works fine on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Overwatch 2 from Blizzard has now launched on Steam and thanks to that, it's super simple to get it working on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Although Steam Deck players will want to change the Proton version.</p>
<p>Valve updated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/proton-experimental-brings-fixes-for-gears-5-overwatch-2-phasmophobia/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental back on July 8th</a>, which included a fix for "Overwatch 2 stopping to register controller inputs after an online match has started". So a big problem on Steam Deck but not so much if you're using a mouse on desktop Linux but for best experience right now just switch to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>When loading for the first time, you will be greeted by the below screen since you do <em>need</em> a Battle.Net account. No fuss though, entering the code into a browser, and it will then link up with your Steam account. Absolutely no issue there, and no need for Battle.Net itself. Much <em>cleaner</em> than how some others are doing it like EA, Ubisoft and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20561807731691702008gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20561807731691702008gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Once you link up an account, Blizzard note you cannot link a different Steam account for 1 year.</em></p>
<p>Until Valve builds up a shader cache and has it ready to download though, expect to see plenty of stuttering which Overwatch 2 has been notorious for in the past with Proton / Wine. After a little while of playing, it will get a lot smoother on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Two shots of it running great on Steam Deck on Medium Graphics Preset (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9357935751691702887gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9357935751691702887gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3297488271691702888gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3297488271691702888gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Running just as expected on desktop Linux too (Kubuntu 23.04) on Ultra Graphics Preset:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21372200951691705236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21372200951691705236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not a whole lot extra to say really. It's not a new game, it's technically been out and playable on both desktop Linux and Steam Deck by just using the Battle.Net launcher with Wine or directly inside Steam with Proton. It works the same as before, it's just a lot easier now.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the user reviews on Steam are not looking good for it. Very quickly after release it hit a Mostly Negative score. Players haven't been happy with Overwatch 2 for some time now so that's not really a big surprise considering how Blizzard handled it with cutting planned content.</p>

      <title>Quake II Remastered shadow dropped, Playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two years ago, at Quake Con 2021, id Software and Nightdive Studios shadow dropped a remaster of the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/Quake/" target="_blank">Quake</a> which was critically acclaimed for its features and meticulous polish. Two years later, id Software and Nightdive are at it again with an enhanced version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2320/Quake_II/" target="_blank">Quake II</a>, available now for all platforms and the best part is that, if you already own Quake II on Steam, it's a free update.</p>
<p>Quake II is <em>currently</em> listed as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable on Steam Deck, although that rating is from the original version so needs Valve to re-review it.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown from <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/450N8MVDARIvpjK8nbhKlF/quake-ii-release-notes-and-faq" target="_blank">Bethesda's own launch page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes the original Quake II campaign plus both Mission Packs, The Reckoning, Ground Zero, plus the previously Nintendo 64-exclusive Quake II 64 and the brand-new Call of the Machine episode from MachineGames.</li>
<li>Improvements to gameplay, including content restored from the original development, plus visual upgrades such as dynamic shadows, improved lighting, glow maps and more.</li>
<li>Play local split-screen and online across four Multiplayer modes with crossplay functionality:
<ul>
<li>Cooperative</li>
<li>Deathmatch</li>
<li>Team Deathmatch</li>
<li>Capture the Flag</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add AI opponents in Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes, explore the id Vault, enjoy improved co-op play and much more!</li>
<li>Various accessibility additions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Additional Editor note from Liam Dawe:</em> giving it a run on Steam Deck with Proton 8 - it works out of the box. Thanks to Nightdive's upgrades it has the Vulkan API by default, and supports the Steam Deck's native 800p resolution too with controller support working perfectly. Even with the enhancements turned on appears to give really good performance too. Screenshots below:</p>

      <title>Auto-battling deck-building roguelike &#39;Hadean Tactics&#39; adds gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Allowing you to kick-back and relax a bit more, Hadean Tactics the roguelike deckbuilding game fused with an autobattler now has gamepad support. Hopefully this is another step towards bumping it up from Unsupported to Verified on Steam Deck. It does already have Native Linux support too and they said they are working on improving it for Steam Deck too!</p>
<p>The developer said it was a lot of work to add controller support in requiring a "deep dive into the game's infrastructure", and this latest update also pulled in a rework of their Compendium which has you unlock entries as you go through your journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17143284091691688516gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17143284091691688516gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recruit souls trapped in the underworld to automatically battle for you, and influence their actions with the cards you find during your run. Combine your cards and relics with their skills and alliances to guide them to victory.</li>
<li>Explore a new map on each run. Discover the different circles of the realm, and the different bosses that rule it. Experience unique events both outside and during combat.</li>
<li>Create and play with your own custom Heroes and decks. Manage their stats, combine any skill and alliance, develop and perfect your own synergies and strategies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's still in Early Access but it seems that will end soon with the 1.0 release planned to come towards the end of the month.</p>
<p>Check out their original trailer below to see what it's like:</p>

      <title>Papers, Please turns 10 and hits 5 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Papers, Please is a game about being an immigration officer in a fictional dystopian country named Arstotzka. It's quite a unique experience and clearly did well for the developer Lucas Pope.</p>
<p>On August 8th it turned 10 years old, and the <a href="https://papersplea.se/#year10" target="_blank">official site</a> notes it's now sold over 5 million copies. So that's somewhere around 500,000 copies a year. Considering this is from a solo developer, with a really simplistic graphics style it's genuinely very impressive.</p>
<p>Original trailer:</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The communist state of Arstotzka has just ended a 6-year war with neighboring Kolechia and reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin.</p>
<p>Your job as immigration inspector is to control the flow of people entering the Arstotzkan side of Grestin from Kolechia. Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists.</p>
<p>Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, the developer even made their own little webgame demake named <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/lcd-please" target="_blank">LCD, Please</a>.</p>

      <title>Broforce Forever has launched with new characters, enemies and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broforce Forever is now available as a big free upgrade for all owners, here's a little look over what's new for my favourite action-platformer.</p>
<p>This is one update where you're going to want to start an entirely fresh campaign to play through. As it offers an " expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra patriotic bros, four new new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes".</p>
<p>The new characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seth Brondle - Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Broforce Forever’s biggest bug yet! Climb on ceilings and utilise explosive teleportation as you swat evildoers like flies.</li>
<li>Xebro - Use your formidable fighting and flying Chakram skills to help those who are unable to defend themselves. Strike fear into the hearts of terrorism with your war cry, then cut them up real good with your sword.</li>
<li>Desperabro - Harness the power of music to enchant evil before blowing it away with dual sawn-off shotguns. Every man deserves one last chance to dance before he dies.</li>
<li>Broffy the Vampire Slayer - Become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!</li>
<li>Burt Brommer - Embrace freedom in the most patriotic way possible: OVERKILL. Snipe your way around the world vanquishing evil with pinpoint accuracy, or just get back to basics and ram dynamite down its throat.</li>
<li>Demolition Bro - Send a maniac to catch a maniac! With his Bouncing Bomberman Bomb and Freeze Grenade, this Bro is ready to put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8c2aYrFV9uE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ea812c7ca6708b3eb384d895161d1ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8c2aYrFV9uE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/broforce?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/broforce?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Broforce has a Native Linux version and it is also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>What the developers said about this update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's it, it's finally out!<br/>
Fun fact - getting this update out the door took longer than the entire rest of the game took to make. When we started it we thought it would be funny to call it "BROFORCE Forever", but nobody is laughing now.</p>
<p>We had various elaborate ideas for the update - including things such as procedurally generated levels, or a standalone roguelite spinoff version of the game. Unfortunately, for various reasons - mostly that the ideas were bad and the execution worse - they did not work out. However, we did manage to scavenge some playable crumbs from that desert of disappointment and combine them into a substantial update (which happens to include desert levels) that we're proud of and that we hope you'll like as well.</p>
<p>The best way to play this update, in our opinion, is to start a new game and replay the entire campaign and enjoy that nostalgic feeling you get about that time about ten years ago when we made you feel nostalgic about a time about twenty years before that. You can perhaps consider going on an elaborate recruiting mission beforehand to find all your old bros from years ago and get them back together for one last mission. Even though they said they were done and they are too old for this shit, their sense of duty to liberty, justice and freedom will compel them to save the world from Satanic terrorist aliens - just this one last time.</p>
<p>Finally, we'd like to say thanks again to everyone for the support over the years. The reception of Broforce has surpassed every hope we could have had and we are forever grateful for that. Thanks also to all our collaborators, who are too many to mention, for all the invaluable contributions over the years. We'd also like to apologise to Special Reserve and the people who preordered the physical version of the game - the delays are totally on us as we really wanted the physical version of Broforce to represent the definitive and final version of the game. We'd also like to apologise for ignoring everyone's bro suggestions and adding Seth Brondle instead.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental improves Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 launcher, Unreal Engine 4 bugs on Intel GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Proton Experimental release is now live from August 9th, there's some nice looking fixes included so here's what to expect from it for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First there's a newly playable title listed with Arthurian Legends. And then there's all the bug fixes which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Garry's Mod not working on certain systems with very long Steam Library paths.</li>
<li>Fixed Baldur's Gate 3 launcher sometimes displaying dxdiag error dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed Locoland not allowing to select resolution on Steam Deck in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fixed Age of Empires IV crashing when locale is set to Traditional/Simplified Chinese.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition that caused controller hotplug not work in some rare cases.</li>
<li>Fixed some Unreal Engine 4 games (e.g. Stray, System Shock (2023), Dead By Daylight and Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun) crashing with Intel GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed Age of Wonders 4's Paradox Launcher not working on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation DirectX 12 mode not working.</li>
<li>Improved video playback in Sea of Thieves and Romancelvania.</li>
<li>Fixed a few Proton 8.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>Have a Nice Death no longer crashes on launch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to see a little fix for the Baldur's Gate 3 launcher, although the error didn't actually affect anything. You can easily just skip the launcher on desktop Linux with this launch option: <code class="inline-code">--skip-launcher</code></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Downfall is a new &#39;severe&#39; flaw in Intel CPUs, while AMD deal with INCEPTION</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Uh oh! Another rather serious security flaw has been found in Intel CPUs named Downfall, so here's a bit of info on it. Additionally, AMD are also dealing with INCEPTION.</p>
<p><em>First up, the details on the Intel side.</em></p>
<p>Discovered by Google researcher Daniel Moghimi who put up a <a href="https://downfall.page/" target="_blank">dedicated website</a> for it, the issue affects Intel generations from Skylake to 11th gen Tiger Lake and allows attackers to target things like passwords and encryption keys which can then lead onto all sorts of problems. It's listed under <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40982" target="_blank">CVE-2022-40982</a> and Intel has <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/gather-data-sampling.html" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it and they're calling it 'Gather Data Sampling (GDS)' but Downfall sounds <em>cooler</em>.</p>
<p>As Moghimi explained in the brief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-40982, enables a user to access and steal data from other users who share the same computer. For instance, a malicious app obtained from an app store could use the Downfall attack to steal sensitive information like passwords, encryption keys, and private data such as banking details, personal emails, and messages. Similarly, in cloud computing environments, a malicious customer could exploit the Downfall vulnerability to steal data and credentials from other customers who share the same cloud computer.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is caused by memory optimization features in Intel processors that unintentionally reveal internal hardware registers to software. This allows untrusted software to access data stored by other programs, which should not be normally be accessible. I discovered that the Gather instruction, meant to speed up accessing scattered data in memory, leaks the content of the internal vector register file during speculative execution. To exploit this vulnerability, I introduced Gather Data Sampling (GDS) and Gather Value Injection (GVI) techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://downfall.page/media/downfall.pdf" target="_blank">full paper on it here</a> and a full list of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html" target="_blank">affected processors here</a>.</p>
<p>Intel said there may be a performance impact of "up to 50%" with mitigations, although they also claim the impact to "most workloads is minimal".</p>
<hr/>
<p>The other side of this is AMD with <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005.html" target="_blank">INCEPTION</a> discovered by Daniël Trujillo, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi of ETH Zurich noted as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20569" target="_blank">CVE-2023-20569</a>. The summary for this from AMD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD has received an external report titled ‘INCEPTION’, describing a new speculative side channel attack. The attack can result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure. This attack is similar to previous branch prediction-based attacks like Spectrev2 and Branch Type Confusion (BTC)/RetBleed. As with similar attacks, speculation is constrained within the current address space and to exploit, an attacker must have knowledge of the address space and control of sufficient registers at the time of RET (return from procedure) speculation. Hence, AMD believes this vulnerability is only potentially exploitable locally, such as via downloaded malware, and recommends customers employ security best practices, including running up-to-date software and malware detection tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What AMD processors are affected? Looks like most Zen generation processors.</p>
<p>AMD did say they're not aware of any exploit using it outside of the research environment at this time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>So you'll want to keep an eye on any system updates coming through regardless of being on AMD or Intel, to ensure you're up to date and fully protected. Better to be safe than sorry eh? You should also keep an eye out for any needed BIOS updates as they come in.</p>

      <title>Vagrus - The Riven Realms gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vagrus - The Riven Realms is a narrative-heavy RPG that mixes in exploration, turn-based combat, resource management and more. As of the latest upgrade it's also now <strong>Steam Deck Verified</strong>. This is a game for people who like things a bit <em>slower</em>, as it's not constant action and does require quite a lot of thoughtful reading, the world is also really interesting.</p>
<p>It already had Native Linux support and they previously got it to a Steam Deck Playable status but they weren't satisfied, and worked on another upgrade to go all the way. Nice to see developers on games of all kinds look to improve the feel on Steam Deck as often the updates help it run better on desktops too.</p>

      <title>Valheim has a rather large bug-fix release in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for the next bigger patch for survival game Valheim? Developer Iron Gate has a new public test available with lots of fixes. This is not a content focused patch, that's still to come a while later, this is just to clean up issues players have been reporting.</p>
<p>Since this is in the public test you can access it via the Betas option on Steam, you just need to enter the "yesimadebackups" password, because it can cause issues and they want to be sure you're not diving in without thinking. If you don't want a potential to mess up your worlds, wait for the main release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20415517161691586357gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20415517161691586357gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Stability:</strong></p>
<p>* Various crash fixes related to generation and projectiles<br/>
* Fixed a bug that could cause more backups than intended to be created for world saves when migrated from an older version<br/>
* Fixed a bug where creating a new world with the same name as a just deleted world would give that world the same seed as the just deleted world<br/>
* Fixed an issue that could make worlds with certain very large dungeon seeds to not be loadable<br/>
* Fixed an issue where saving of world on server and character on client could be out of sync, all saving methods should now work the same way<br/>
* Fixed an issue where a world is saved twice when using manual save, doubling the amount of save time<br/>
* Fix memory leak when opening and closing the skill dialog<br/>
* Added check for available cloud storage after save and before world start (which should prevent world wipes after all)</p>

      <title>Now official: you can buy a refurbished Steam Deck from Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/looks-like-valve-will-sell-refurbished-steam-decks/" target="_blank">leaked a bit too early</a>, Valve have now confirmed and put up all three Steam Deck models to buy refurbished direct from the Steam store. On the official main Steam Deck website, if you scroll down a bit there's a new link leading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished" target="_blank">Valve Certified Refurbished Steam Deck page</a> where you can order one.</p>
<p>The confirmed pricing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck 64 GB - Certified Refurbished: $319 / £279</li>
<li>Steam Deck 256 GB - Certified Refurbished: $419 / £369</li>
<li>Steam Deck 512 GB - Certified Refurbished: $519 / £459</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted by Valve, "Each Certified Refurbished Steam Deck has been thoroughly tested to the same high standards as our retail units. Every device goes through a complete factory reset, software update, and an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve's facilities. Among the tests are all controller inputs, the audio system, the screen, and internals. Battery health is also assessed to ensure proper functionality and longevity.</p>
<p>All refurbished units meet or even exceed the performance standards of new retail units. Although they may have minor cosmetic blemishes, they provide a reliable, high-quality gaming experience at a lower cost."</p>
<p>They all include the same full one year warranty as a brand new Steam Deck, a refurbished power supply and carrying case. In the FAQ at the bottom Valve also notes that stock levels will come and go over time, as they are selected from customer returns that "pass rigorous criteria".</p>
<p>Additionally, GameStop <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/1688648746903461888" target="_blank">announced</a> they will <em>also</em> be selling refurbished Steam Decks, which are entirely separate to what Valve are doing available for GameStop Pro members only.</p>

      <title>83 of the top 100 most played Steam games work on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a look at the most-played games on Steam by player-count, here's how many of them should be playable on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Checking via the Steam Deck Verified rating (either Verified or Playable), and then the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> / Linux Native rating for desktop Linux.</p>
<p>While the top 100 changes quite often, it's still a really interesting way to look at overall compatibility.</p>
<p>Overall we're seeing <strong>83/100</strong> at least rated Playable on Steam Deck and <strong>84/100</strong> work on desktop Linux with a Gold rating on ProtonDB or higher (or Linux Native support).</p>

<p><em>Note: I intentionally did not remove stuff like Wallpaper Engine and tmodloader, as the point was the full top 100 exactly as it was on Steam at the time. This top 100 snapshot was taken today at around 17:00 BST. It seems around this time Destiny 2 also had a big player drop so it fell out of the top 100, missing it was not intentional but the list is accurate for the time it was taken.</em></p>
<p>So that's the position the Steam Deck and desktop Linux are in a bit over half way through 2023. Hopefully you found that and the ratings interesting listed together like this.</p>

      <title>One of my favourite roguelikes Jupiter Hell adds modding support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh hell! Time for another few runs then I think. Jupiter Hell, one of my favourite roguelikes with seriously slick movement design now has modding support. <em>ChaosForge team, the developer of Jupiter Hell, gained recognition for creating Doom, the Roguelike (known also as DRL.) They built the Jupiter Hell as a spiritual successor to DRL.</em></p>
<p>For the Steam version it also now has Steam Workshop support, making it just a few clicks to add in some mods and there's already a few available including a Medic class, an in-game wiki, a Mega Challenge Pack and more. The developer is building up the documentation on how to mod Jupiter Hell on <a href="https://github.com/chaosforgeorg/jh-mods/wiki/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20906720621691509650gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20906720621691509650gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's various other bits added in the latest update too including new exotic weapons, consumables and armour to find in the early game. New emails to read for some background info, and they've changed up how Easy mode works to reduce enemy damage but still give them good accuracy. Plus there's a good few tweaks elsewhere in the game.</p>
<p>If you've not played it and you're a roguelike fan, you're missing out. It's such a great mixture of action because of the way they've done the turn system, it doesn't really feel like it's turn based because it's so <em>smooooth</em>!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/jupiter_hell" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/jupiter-hell?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/811320/Jupiter_Hell/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's also 60% off on Steam until August 11th - cracking good deal that. It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Looks like Valve will sell refurbished Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>UPDATE 18:15 UTC</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/now-official-you-can-buy-a-refurbished-steam-deck-from-valve/" target="_blank">this is now official see the latest article</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valve seemed to let slip a bit early that they plan to sell refurbished models of Steam Deck for cheaper prices but the store pages were quickly hidden.</p>
<p>The store pages that appeared noted the Steam Decks were "Certified Refurbished" but now the store pages just redirect to the Steam home page. It was just long enough for SteamDB scraping to capture them though, much I'm sure to Valve's annoyance each time SteamDB manages to help everyone get a little peek behind the curtain:</p>
<p>Here's the expected prices:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/903905/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 64 GB - Certified Refurbished</a>: $319 / £279</li>
<li><a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/903906/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 256 GB - Certified Refurbished</a>: $419 / £369</li>
<li><a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/903907/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 512 GB - Certified Refurbished</a>: $519 / £459</li>
</ul>
<p>It should go without saying though: until Valve put it up officially, this might <em>not</em> actually happen.</p>
<p>When I hear any more I will let you know but this could be a great way to snap up a true bargain for such a versatile gaming system. Seems like a great idea for Valve to do officially from their store too, as no doubt they have plenty of them ready for people.</p>
<p>Would you pick up a refurbished Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>Celebrate the end of Summer with this Capcom Steam Sale</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The summer season is coming to an end; students are heading back to school and tech deals are popping up from left to right.

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 31: The Fear of Loss</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-30-imperial-purple/" target="_blank">Part 30: Imperial Purple</a></strong></p>
<p>I was trawling through the old web one evening, looking for additional resources on early Linux gaming, when I came across a freeware game I had never heard of before. Entitled <em>Phobia III - Edge Of Humanity</em>, it was mentioned on a short lived website called PCBurn online between 2003 and 2007, which described <em>Phobia III</em> as a "commercial quality game" that they "deemed worthy of spending a goodly amount of time on" back in 2003. High praise indeed.</p>
<p>It turns out the game has something of a pedigree, with the previous <em>Alien Phobia</em> for MS-DOS as well as <em>Phobia II</em> for Windows coming out in 1997 and 1998 respectively. <em>Phobia III</em> seems to draw from the same well that Frozenbyte would later drink from for <em>Shadowgrounds</em>, being a top down shooter which tasks you with clearing the screen of an encroaching horde of alien bugs. Developer RedLynx also happens to be based in Finland, as is 10tons who made the similar <em>Crimsonlands</em>.</p>
<p>As with PCBurn, the website for <em>Phobia III</em> also seems to have been ephemeral, but the original website can still be accessed through the Wayback Machine on the Internet Archive. The Linux version of the game found in the phobia3-linux.tar.bz2 archive was not saved, although this is hardly surprising as RedLynx was relying on the file being hosted by external mirrors. Little did I know that this was going to be the start of a long and daunting quest.</p>
<p>All searching for phobia3-linux.tar.bz2 online did was bring up some old forum posts that linked back to the same mirrors that RedLynx were relying on; it seemed no one else had ever bothered rehosting the game. I did discover that <em>Phobia III</em> was later packaged as part of the Russian made <em>LinuxCenter Games Collection Vol.2</em> compilation, a selection of Linux gaming files that was sold on either four CD-ROMs or a single DVD, but this too appeared to have been scrubbed from the internet.</p>
<p>My hopes were raised somewhat when I found that the game had been uploaded to Tucows, meaning the Internet Archive should have a copy as part of their Tucows Software Library. This proved to be another dead end, as the <em>Phobia III - Edge Of Humanity</em> entry merely contained a torrent that downloaded the same phobiass.gif file featured on the entry itself. It was really starting to look like phobia3-linux.tar.bz2 had become Linux gaming lost media.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3241973721691433852gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3241973721691433852gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15666419041691433853gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15666419041691433853gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>After over an hour of searching I stumbled onto the Gratisgames24.ch website, a Swiss free gaming outfit that does host the Linux versions of games alongside their Windows and Mac counterparts. This is by no means the norm, and I only loaded the page as I was just scrolling through Google for anything I could find at this point. The download failed to initiate at first as I was using Google Translate, but sure enough the phobia3-linux.tar.bz2 archive was available as promised.</p>
<p>So after all that trouble, is the game even worth it? As a demo for showing off the abilities of both the SMPEG and SDL libraries then <em>Phobia III</em> certainly had merit, as the pre-rendered cut-scenes are of a level you would expect from a retail CD-ROM game, apart from the opening narration being hard to make out. This same quality extends to rest of the game's art assets. <em>Phobia III</em> also features an original metal soundtrack in Ogg Vorbis format, which is again about what you would expect from Finns.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, I am not a fan of how the trooper slithers along, with the fact you can not really shoot in the same direction as you are walking making dodging and firing at the same time near impossible. You are left at best being a mobile turret, even when not taking advantage of the many mounted gun placements found across the six levels. The stages are designed in such a way that there really is only one correct order to do things in, as otherwise you are guaranteed to just get swarmed.</p>
<p>The one concession <em>Phobia III</em> makes is that you do not need to clear a stage in order to advance; you simply need to earn enough "honor points", which means even your deaths amount to something. Which is good, as many of them were due to my getting caught on level geometry. The game also crawls when a sufficient number of bugs make their way on the screen, and there is a fair amount of, if not outright broken, then at the very least strained English.</p>
<p>And you know what the worst part is? My search was unnecessary. RedLynx moved the <em>Phobia III</em> website to a different URL a few years later, and this one was fully captured by the Wayback Machine, including all of the now locally hosted download links. Since I do have it I might as well give <em>Phobia III</em> more of a chance, and since it has a two player cooperative mode, I might just rope my brother into giving me another hand. For a game of last stands, at least this did not prove to be its last.</p>

      <title>Steam is having a festival for Visual Novels until August 14th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for some story time? If you're into Visual Novels, there's a good chance for you to find something new to play on Steam in their Visual Novel Fest. Running now until August 14th at 10 AM PT / 5PM UTC, you can also claim a daily reward just for showing up with the first being an animated Steam profile avatar.</p>
<p>Valve even made a little trailer for the event:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aHlRY8V-Kig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/93f3c37e797e93c8006096c0e0ec6c9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aHlRY8V-Kig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this being I genre I play close to never, it's not really something I have a lot of suggestions on but I did genuinely enjoy going through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/234270/Ken_Folletts_The_Pillars_of_the_Earth/" target="_blank">Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth</a> (90% off), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/743450/Monster_Prom/" target="_blank">Monster Prom</a> (75% off), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342620/Werewolf_The_Apocalypse__Heart_of_the_Forest/" target="_blank">Werewolf: The Apocalypse — Heart of the Forest</a> (70% off), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a> (25% off) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/" target="_blank">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</a> looks pretty great too. I am an <em>uncultured swine</em> when it comes to visual novels, they just very rarely appeal to me.</p>
<p>You can find the festival on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/visual_novel/" target="_blank">Visual Novel tag on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you find something you think others need to play do stay a while and make a comment. Maybe you can convince me to play another - do your best.</p>

      <title>Check out the demos for Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power and Regulator City</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indie developer Orangepixel currently has two really fun looking games worth looking into, both offering full Native Linux support and they both have newer demos available to try out.</p>
<p>The first is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1892750/Regulator_City/" target="_blank">Regulator City</a></strong> arriving sometime this year, a top down roguelike shooter where you are backed by a team of NPC's and use your skills and super-power abilities to stop an Alien substance from taking over the city. Complete missions, upgrade skills, and regulate the city.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2700952281691426595gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>YOUR TEAM IS YOUR WEAPON - In this top-down shooter you are not alone, you are backed up by a team of trigger happy experts. They will help you out by taking down enemies, breaching doors, gathering intel, and destroying stuff! Use them as your main weapon! You can lead the pack - but you can also just dictate the direction and let them do the dangerous work. It's all about you surviving the missions.. we can clone new team mates !</li>
<li>SHAPE THE CITY - Completing misisons will allow you to select new buildings for future missions, and the type of building is important! Build a hospital and you might gain 2 HP on your next mission. Or select an industrial building and unlock new weapon technology. Just don't forget: type of buildings also have an effect on the gangs in the city!</li>
<li>SUPER POWERS The alien substance that crashed in the city doesn't just change the behavior of gang members. It has also been used to give you super abilities! Each playable character has a different set of Abilities and special dodge move. Collect Alien Ooze throughout the city, to power your special ability and unleash it when you're back is against the wall!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The other is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2374320/Heroes_Of__Loot_Gauntlet_Of_Power/" target="_blank">Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power</a></strong> coming a bit later in 2024, it's a fast paced, randomly generated action RPG shooter with dungeon crawling and Rogue-like elements. The developer previously explained it's a bit like combining Vampire Survivors with The Binding of Isaac which has my interest piqued.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12642389361691426697gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>This one is a bit earlier in development, with the full feature plan not currently set but the idea is fun. In an email the developer, Pascal, mentioned how it came from "this silly idea I had one Sunday afternoon and got the core game loop all working and playable within just a few weeks".</p>
<p>They also have lots of videos going over game development on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@orangepixelgames" target="_blank">their YouTube channel</a>.</p>

      <title>NVK the open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA merged into Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, it happened! The open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs named NVK has been officially merged into Mesa. This means it will be available as an experimental option in the Mesa 23.3 release due in a couple of months (not the upcoming 23.2 release). <em>Note: this is not made by NVIDIA directly but various open source devs.</em></p>
<p>Over a year of work went into the driver by developers Faith Ekstrand, Karol Herbst, Dave Airlie and a bunch of other community contributors. Additionally Danilo Krummrich has been working on building up Nouveau kernel support for the new memory binding and execution API required by NVK.</p>
<p>What hardware is currently supported? Turing (RTX 20XX and GTX 16XX) and later GPUs, with plans to go far back even to Kepler (GeForce 600 and 700 series). You'll need a new Linux kernel though with the support being included for the new API it needs in Linux 6.6 and later.</p>
<p>A big milestone for NVK to be included in Mesa but it's far from finished. Plenty of games will work with it both Native and running through compatibility layers like Wine / Proton but plenty also won't work properly. It's all still pretty experimental overall but it's getting there.</p>

      <title>Modrinth announce their Minecraft launcher is now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now available for more people to test, with more features and bug fixes the Modrinth launcher for Minecraft is now in Beta. Their team say they are try to change  the modded Minecraft landscape with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5677300651691406411gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5677300651691406411gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7764386771691406410gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7764386771691406410gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Modrinth App on Linux, click pictures to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>I especially liked the walk-through it did when first loading in, guiding you through the Minecraft login, a login to their website and then it talks you through how to use the launcher. It all seems very professional and much sleeker than any other launcher I've used so far.</p>
<p>Features it offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for vanilla, Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.</li>
<li>Full support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
<li>Modrinth modpack importing, either through the website or through a .mrpack file.</li>
<li>Modrinth modpack exporting to the .mrpack format to upload to the website or share with friends.</li>
<li>Importing of instances from a variety of different launchers, including MultiMC, GDLauncher, ATLauncher, CurseForge, and Prism Launcher.</li>
<li>The ability to update, add, and remove individual mods in a modpack.</li>
<li>The ability to run different modded instances in parallel.</li>
<li>The ability to view and share current and historical logs.</li>
<li>An auto-updater to ensure the app is always up-to-date.</li>
<li>An interactive tutorial to show you through the core features of the app.</li>
<li>Performance through the roof, backed by Rust and Tauri (not Electron!).</li>
<li>Fully open-source under the GNU GPLv3 license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the other work they've been doing recently includes boosting up their security, especially after the big modding incident recently where a bunch of mods on other modding platforms were compromised. So they've put up in-house authentication, two-factor authentication, and scoped personal access tokens. They also stopped entirely relying on GitHub for authentication and so you can now use Discord, Microsoft, Google, Steam, and/or GitLab or just stick with normal username / password to login.</p>
<p>There's more so read about it in <a href="https://blog.modrinth.com/p/launcher?1=1" target="_blank">their blog post</a>. It's good to see Modrinth keep expanding, as it's a great platform for Minecraft modding and much more user and developer friendly. Especially nice with their open source focus on the app and the platform itself.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://modrinth.com/app" target="_blank">download it here</a>.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the biggest RPG releases of all time on Steam, Baldur's Gate 3 has now been given the Steam Deck Verified badge of approval from Valve.</p>
<p>Valve did also upgrade Proton Hotfix for the game, which they've now set by default which works around some problems from the older version of Proton it was set for during Early Access. So you no longer need to set Proton Experimental on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3034967671691405429gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3034967671691405429gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Seeing it get Verified is a <em>surprise</em> to me though actually, because I really don't think it deserves to be Verified. Playable? Sure, but the defaults given to the game give a really blurry picture thanks to the old AMD FSR it has and quite poor performance at times. Even turning the settings down gives you numerous areas that will drop it below 30FPS which is supposed to be the minimum acceptable performance floor for both Playable and Verified. Things I already mentioned in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">original release article</a>.</p>
<p>Even our friends at SteamDeckHQ <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/the-steam-deck-verified-system-needs-to-change/" target="_blank">wrote a bit recently</a> on Deck Verified being problematic on what Valve sets as Verified. As we keep seeing games being Verified that have some big performance issues. Not all the time, the <em>overall</em> number being Verified is largely correct but it does make more of us question how these games are being tested for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's Verified now and it does work out of the box on Steam Deck but you really do need to change the graphics settings. I have some suggestions in my previous video on the full release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KJqkto37uCM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6be4520e56eb7883d9a5f87efd75ff7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KJqkto37uCM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>There's also no such thing as "Best Settings" because it's highly subjective. Try tweaking it to your own liking.</em></p>
<p>I've chosen to spend the majority of my time with it on my Linux desktop (which is pretty rare now), because in this case it's just more comfortable and the battery life of BG3 on Steam Deck is quite poor too. Turns out you can also get around Larian's disabling of split-screen for Steam Deck too with a simple Steam launch command, as a Valve developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1687614003453829120" target="_blank">noted on X</a> (formerly Twitter): <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code></p>
<p>Still, once Larian get a few more patches in and add in AMD FSR 2.2 they said will come in September, it will probably run a whole lot nicer then so I will be keeping a very close eye on it.</p>

      <title>Automate a kitchen with programmed robots in Neon Noodles out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access since 2019, Neon Noodles - Cyberpunk Kitchen Automation has now fully released and it looks great. I liked it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/meal-making-automation-in-the-zach-like-neon-noodles-feels-great/" target="_blank">when I tried it out</a> some time ago so it's good to see the developer finish it up.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? "Neon Noodles is inspired by the open-ended, machine-building puzzle games of Zachtronics such as Opus Magnum and Infinifactory. Take on challenging assignments from a cast of intriguing clients, design complex and beautiful automations to uncover the truth behind Neon Noodles."</p>
<p>If you like a programming-styled logic puzzle games focused on automation like various Zachtronics stuff this might be for you. Imagine if you will, an Overcooked styled game but you automate it with a neon cyberpunk theme and that about sums it up.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create automations as intricate or as simple as you like, using everything from programmable robot chefs to teleport stations.</li>
<li>Automate your robot chefs through an intuitive record-and-replay system where you control a robot and have it replicate your exact inputs, and only edit later if needed.</li>
<li>Solve endlessly replayable open-ended puzzles with 250 recipes from around the world consisting of 400 unique ingredients. Jollof Rice, Clam Chowder, Spätzle, Bibimbap - so many recipes to optimize!</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a cyberpunk story where food is a luxury and ruthless corporate greed runs unchecked.</li>
<li>Compare your scores with friends and see global leaderboards score distributions as a histogram.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990900/Neon_Noodles__Cyberpunk_Kitchen_Automation/" target="_blank">now on Steam</a> with Native Linux support and the developer said it offers full Steam Deck support too, although it is not currently Verified they expect it to be.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included has a new animated short and free content upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More content for your colony? Absolutely. Klei has put out the latest free update for Oxygen Not Included and there's another of their fancy animated shorts.</p>
<p>First up, check out the short below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kdy5F6-1HtY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b7be9033d245ba022982eeb68a3585a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kdy5F6-1HtY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So what's actually in the update? Well the Gassy Moos creatures can now be milked. That's right you can now get space milk. Well they call it Brackene but whatever. Your duplicants can drink Brackene and your little Critters can get it from the new Critter Fountain - in both cases it's a nutrient-free mood booster.</p>
<p>You can also refine Brackene into a strange polymer called Brackwax at the new Brackwax Gleaner building, which is then used to make a highly heat-resistant super plastic called Plastium, or as a lubricant for faster travel in transit tubes.</p>
<p>You might also find that Gassy Moos will now belt out a tune to attract more of them to your colony.</p>
<p>Other stuff added in includes a Bleach Stone Hopper building to produce Bleach Stone, Meteors will now drop some resources when you annihiliate them with the Meteor Blaster and the Egg Cracker now has an automation port. Oh, and Duplicants can now eat Raw Egg because why not but it's probably better to cook 'em up.</p>
<p>There's also various UI improvements to the Supply Closet with over 50 new cosmetic skins available.</p>
<p>Oxygen Not Included has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified - you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>My favourite Tower Defense game Bloons TD 6 is free on Epic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bloons TD 6 is an absolutely wonderful family-friendly Tower Defense game, and if you don't own it already you can grab it free on Epic Games and it works great on Linux.</p>
<p>Easy enough to download it and run it thanks to the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> too. And to test, since I already have it on Steam, their cloud login system perfectly synced my progress across so that was nice to see. Running it with Wine-GE-Proton8-13, which you can download directly inside Heroic has given a perfect experience on my desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7406549331691164840gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7406549331691164840gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Bloons TD 6 is absolutely madness once it gets going. It's a weirdly theraputic game, watching various different types of balloons getting popped by monkeys. What a wonderful idea for a game. So simple but it's hard to tear yourself away from it once you get going, you just want to play one more map.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of content you get with the game too, and it can be a thorough challenge on some of the later maps. Don't be fooled by the easy start on this one!</p>
<p>Go grab it free on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/bloons-td-6-bf95a0" target="_blank">Epic Games</a>. Seriously do it, such a great game. Have enjoyed a lot of hours of this one, and lots of that in co-op with friends and family.</p>
<p><em>You can also grab <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/loop-hero" target="_blank">Loop Hero</a> free too, another great game!</em></p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-11 is out now for Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Glorious eggrolls! There's another release of GE-Proton available for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, so here's the details on what's changed. <em>Actually, there's two releases, with the very latest just fixing up a woops.</em></p>
<p>This is the version of Proton not supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>The main changes for 8-10 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge (fixes Ubisoft Connect, adds patch needed for some UE4 games)</li>
<li>steam runtime update pulled from upstream</li>
<li>patch required for EALink from upstream wine added (<a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2740" target="_blank">https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2740</a>)</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>protonfix added for kovaaks (thanks xaizone)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the 8-11 was a hotfix as "Somehow the addon patches for GE-Proton8-10 did not get applied.. whoops :|. They are applied now in this release. DXVK and wine also updated."</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 out now and works on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those interested in the latest big RPG from Larian Studios, here's my quick initial report on Baldur's Gate 3 running on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Keep in mind this is just some initial testing thoughts - it's a <em>very</em> big game.</p>
<p>The first and most important thing: right now it appears you're going to want <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> set on it. You can install it from your Steam Library, and then go into the game's Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box and select Proton Experimental from the drop-down that appears. Otherwise, you're likely to see a bunch of crashing issues. Currently Valve has it set to Proton 7 which is somewhat old now as that was tested for verification back in September 2022 when it was in Early Access. <strong>Update 04/08/23</strong> - Valve <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1687497658863177730" target="_blank">released</a> an update to Proton Hotfix for it so you may wish to now use that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19133090351691088005gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19133090351691088005gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Baldur's Gate 3 on openSUSE Linux, Ultra Details (Frametiming spikes from screenshots).</em></p>
<p>After setting the right Proton, the game will launch and run properly. From my initial testing though, one problem I have seen currently is that the audio is at times just a bit out of sync and the narrator can get cut-off before finishing a sentence. Not <em>all</em> the time but it <em>is</em> an issue I've noticed on desktop.</p>
<p>One issue in the launcher you may see is a message about outdated drivers on Linux, which can safely be ignored because it's looking for Windows drivers and we have different version numbers. Aside from that, the launcher works as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6374929001691085625gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6374929001691085625gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I also see this error every time I launch that appears, but it can safely be clicked away without an issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7686019481691085624gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7686019481691085624gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With my AMD Ryzen 5800x and NVIDIA 2080 Ti, performance has been pretty good. Sticking with it on DirectX 11 as Vulkan (from what I've seen) can be problematic, I've been playing it on the Ultra details preset and the majority of the time it's above 60FPS at 2560x1440. In less intense areas, the FPS has been much higher between 90-100FPS. So far I'm pretty happy with the performance level of running it on Linux with Proton! That said, there's plenty of random stutter, which is most likely the shader cache building up, which will be less of a problem over time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16932035271691089963gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16932035271691089963gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Baldur's Gate 3 on openSUSE Linux, Ultra Details (Frametiming spikes from screenshots).</em></p>
<p>When it comes to the Steam Deck the developers said they were "aiming" for Steam Deck Verified by launch but it seems they didn't quite make it since it's still noted as Playable right now. It does have full controller support ready but they have disabled split-screen on Steam Deck. Additionally, Larian are working on adding AMD FSR 2.2 for September 6th, so performance is likely to be quite a bit better when that's added in. So I'll be taking another proper look at Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam Deck then as well.</p>
<p>So how is it on Steam Deck? Well, it's a bit rough actually. Playable? Yes but performance is <strong>not</strong> great. The defaults set for it on Steam Deck are poor too, with their FSR making it quite blurry. Performance is also all over the place, some parts might shoot up to ~40FPS but <em>lots</em> of it will dip below 30FPS even with various settings turned down to Low.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1557563331691100257gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1557563331691100257gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Pictured: Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>I will <em>suggest</em> setting the Maximum Framerate Cap to 30FPS, VSync to Double Buffering, FSR to Ultra Quality, Model Quality on Low, Texture Filtering to Trilinear, Shadows / Fog and Clouds on Low, Ambient Occlusion turned Off and God Rays turned Off. A lot of the settings are based on what you feel is best though, these are just initial suggestions. You're also only looking at about an hour and a half on the battery.</p>
<p>The user interface on Steam Deck is looking <em>great</em> though, their new controller support is really nice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4930942971691099559gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4930942971691099559gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Pictured: Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Nice to see another <em>massive</em> launch, quite possibly one of the biggest launches of the year, working same-day on Linux and Steam Deck thanks to the power of the Proton compatibility layer. I don't think I can overstate just how important it is for Linux desktop and Steam Deck to have such releases working so promptly, and looking at the player numbers just before hitting publish on release day Baldur's Gate 3 saw around 450,000 people playing it on Steam — that's crazy.</p>
<p>Hopefully their switch over to FSR 2 in September will improve it on Steam Deck though, as it could use a bit of a boost. Still, around 30FPS is pretty okay for a game like this on a handheld with a small screen.</p>
<p>Here's some Steam Deck footage and early thoughts:</p>

<p>Do you need to have played the previous games to enjoy Baldur's Gate 3? Simply put: no. Thankfully. It's an entirely new adventure with new characters but you will see some familiar faces and places if you have played the previous games but no knowledge of them is needed.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Gladius devs new game ZEPHON has a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZEPHON is the upcoming strategy game from Proxy Studios who created Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War and Pandora: First Contact. For a limited time you can check out the first demo for ZEPHON. It has full Native Linux support just like their previous games too!</p>
<p>"Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely. On the planet Earth, that was once a cradle of life, the extinction of humanity is at hand."</p>

<p>Crazy sci-fi setting with city-building, exploration and combat? Sign me up. I'm very much looking forward to the full release on this one, especially as Proxy Studios actually sent over an early preview build that I had a chance to play with and I came away thoroughly impressed. Although the demo and preview build are rather limited, it's a good slice of what to expect from it. Very similar to their previous games, since it's again another 4x strategy game, but they've turned the production values up a notch on this one and it looks absolutely <strong>gorgeous</strong>.</p>

Click it to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>If the performance and action of this early build are anything to go by, the full release is going to be <em>awesome</em>. It left my itching all over for more. The full release is due sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/" target="_blank">demo on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition gets a free starter edition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh how I do love a good RTS. Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition now has a special free starter edition available on Steam. From my own testing, it works great on desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>
<p>This new free starter edition gives you three civilizations to play as, with them being rotated around every 2 weeks and you can play in both single player and multiplayer games. Seems like quite a nice intro into it, especially if you've been on the fence about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8833248881691074485gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8833248881691074485gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition on OpenSUSE Linux, Ultra Details level.</em></p>
<p>Looks like it has a decent player-base on Steam as well with it regularly seeing between 3-4 thousand people but thanks to this and the latest update, it's rocketed back up to over 12 thousand! An update just released also added in these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Online status for friends.</li>
<li>Unique Explorer bonuses.</li>
<li>Tons of new balance updates.</li>
<li>Reworks for Royal Guard and Church technologies.</li>
<li>Enhanced Civilizations &amp; Revolutions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I grew up playing lots the original, and then AoE 2 and never really got to properly try the the third one. So perhaps now with this deal I might dive in a whole lot more. While it's pretty much a glorified demo, it <em>is</em> a good thing to have. </p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/933110/Age_of_Empires_III_Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>
<p><em>Will you be checking it out thanks to this? It has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/933110" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and it's Steam Deck Playable.</em></p>

We can’t wait to see players go back in time with these superb games.”</p>
<p>Just like the first set of games they will have Linux support too. Nice to see!</p>
<p>The games will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Toaplan" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?publishers=bitwave-games" target="_blank">GOG</a> at release on August 24th.</p>

      <title>First-person co-op dungeon crawler &#39;Barony&#39; has major upgrade and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Barony from developer Turning Wheel LLC recently had quite a lovely big upgrade, and thanks to that it's also now Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>The "Quality of Death Update" came thanks to a lot of work they put into the Nintendo Switch port, which thankfully the PC version didn't get left out from. This includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All New UI.</li>
<li>2-4 Player Split-Screen.</li>
<li>Overhauled lighting solution.</li>
<li>Full Steam Deck and gamepad support.</li>
<li>Enhanced content, gameplay tweaks, and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is really just the basic highlights, there's absolutely loads new for the game. The entire you way you set it up and play through looks massively different. From reduced friendly hitboxes for less friendly fire to a new death box system containing all of a dead players belongings for easier pickup. The game as a whole should look a lot flashier too with a new lighting system that looks better and should perform better too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7391375391691062550gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7391375391691062550gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>The full details on the big upgrade can be found in the <a href="https://www.baronygame.com/blog/qod-update-launched" target="_blank">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Main Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Put your skills to the test with perma-death, cryptic dungeons, and no handholding</li>
<li>Cooperate with 1-4 players via split-screen, wireless play between Switch consoles, and the internet including crossplay with other platforms!</li>
<li>Master 13 classes ranging from familiar warrior, wizard, and rogue classes to unique sexton, joker, and arcanist classes</li>
<li>Conquer or be killed by surprises around every corner in a new dungeon every time you play</li>
<li>Invest in deep RPG systems with loads of loot and stats to analyze and synergize</li>
<li>Discover and utilize tons of adventuring weapons, equipment, lore, spells, &amp; legendary artifacts</li>

      <title>Challenging survival city-builder Landnama is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Landnama from developer Sonderland scratches a very weird itch as it mixes exploration, survival and city-building into one and it's quite a challenge too. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent me a key.</p>
<p>The developers say it gives you the "thrill of a dungeon crawler with the vibe of a city builder" and they're not wrong there. You start off with a single tile and a mostly empty map, with you needing to explore tile-by-tile to expand and hopefully survive the coming winter. You have a single resource, heart, which is used for everything and there's no second chances for failure here with an ever-increasing challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19827490591691059195gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19827490591691059195gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a real-time game too, so it's not quite like Civilization although you can pause any time. You need to stock up hearts because when Winter hits, it will take a whole bunch away. Shown in the screenshot above, at that point I had 18/25 hearts and winter will cost somewhere between 9-14. When Winter does hit, it will flick between 9 and 14 and you hit a button to lock in a number (hopefully a lower one). You could attempt to chance the Winter toll, but it can get pretty difficult to land it on a good number.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20935190201691059726gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20935190201691059726gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The problem is deciding where to explore and what buildings to put down, so that you can increase your gradual heart production while also keeping enough back for the Winter. Landnama sprinkles in random events too, some of them can be pretty devastating but others are just a mild inconvenience. Either way, you need to try and be prepared for anything but easier said than done with the randomness of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3046095951691059414gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3046095951691059414gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will take quite a while before you really get somewhere, and you're quite likely to have complete failure on your first few runs. Thankfully, each run doesn't actually take that long and you get multiple chances to play through it each time. When one civ fails, you pick another to carry on your saga.</p>
<p>Eventually you'll get to a run where you've got the exploration and survival aspects down, and you'll start getting a decent amount of heart in each time so that you can expand and not worry too much about Winter. One of the keys is the adjacency bonus of buildings. As you explore, you'll want to salvage some buildings and move them to a better location to allow you to get more heart production so it's a constant game of studying the map.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eSUjA_QYFjc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02d23cc68c97bfc4a899a5fd91422c5b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eSUjA_QYFjc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it now released the developer has been listening closely to feedback on the difficulty and replay value, and they've said they do plan to add in a bunch of extras to address having more to do on repeat runs and they've already addressed one problematic point of the difficulty so I look forward to seeing what they add in future.</p>
<p>The Linux version of Landnama worked great with no issues at all. If you're after a game that will challenge you but still remain somewhat relaxing to play then it's a good choice.</p>

      <title>The 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard looks awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While their software for programming it only officially supports Windows and Android, the 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard sure does look awesome. I need this. Supporting connecting up via USB, Wireless 2.4G and Bluetooth it has a range of options for whatever way you wish to use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16577410881691056004gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>87 keys</li>
<li>Kailh Box White Switches V2</li>
<li>Hot-swappable PCB</li>
<li>Support n-key rollover</li>
<li>Dye-sublimation PBT keycaps with MDA-like height</li>
<li>Programmable buttons</li>
<li>Fast-mapping on programmable buttons (no software needed)</li>
<li>Top mount style</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully at some point someone will be able to provide proper drivers for it on Linux, just like we've seen for various other vendors (like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/openrazer-v36-brings-support-for-11-more-razer-devices/" target="_blank">OpenRazer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/ckb-next-for-configuring-corsair-keyboards-and-mice-v06-out-now/" target="_blank">ckb-next</a>) to get the full use out of it. I always love the build quality of 8BitDo too and their 8BitDo Ultimate Controller is my current favourite gamepad.</p>
<p>It will actually be available in two different versions with the "N" and "Fami" editions:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21196209671691056717gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Plus there's also those two huge red buttons you can connect up with it but they're an extra.</em></p>

      <title>Voxel Doom II is out now for GZDoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spice up your next play-through of Doom II with the new Voxel Doom II mod now available, bringing with it fancy new monster models. Voxel Doom II is the follow up to 2022's award-winning Voxel Doom. This is a new graphics mod that replaces all monsters, weapons, props and items with fully 3d voxel models. It replaces all monsters from both Doom and Doom II.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IQK8m41daAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7645572cd55829ca521f532740d5760.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IQK8m41daAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can grab the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/voxel-doom-ii" target="_blank">mod from Mod DB</a>.</p>
<p>To use it on Linux you will need a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_1993" target="_blank">Doom</a> / <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">Doom II</a> set up with GZDoom in your usual way by placing the doom.wad or doom2.wad into the config folder which is usually <code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code> on a standard install or if you're installing GZDoom from Flathub put them in <code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code>. You'll need to place the Voxel Doom II mod files in there too and then you'll be able to run it.</p>

      <title>Linux continues hitting above 3% desktop user share on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another month down and we can see that the Linux desktop user share is continuing to rise and not just on the recent Steam Survey. While we have Linux hitting close to 2% and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-overtakes-macos-users-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">above macOS on the Steam Survey</a> for the first time, it's nice to see it continuing to rise elsewhere too!</p>
<p>Just as a reminder the data for June on Statcounter showed Linux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/linux-hit-over-3-desktop-user-share/" target="_blank">hitting above 3%</a> for the first time at 3.07%. Well, this month it's smashed that record once again at <strong>3.12%</strong>.</p>
<p>Across this year their stats show for Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li><strong>July - 3.12%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that's with the Windows share also rising, and the macOS share dropping.</p>
<p>Technically, ChromeOS <em>is</em> also a Linux distribution (although people like to argue on that). Quite a different one compared with <em>traditional</em> distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE and others but it's still Linux and it's at 3.24% for July so together it's more like 6.36% desktop share for Linux overall.</p>
<p>See the details on <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide" target="_blank">Statcounter</a>.</p>

      <title>Deceive Inc. quickly became a favourite multiplayer game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deceive Inc. from Sweet Bandits Studios and Tripwire Presents released back in March and it recently became Steam Deck Verified. After playing quite a few hours, it quickly became a favourite on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. <u>Note</u>: Gamesight provided my key.</p>
<p>It's a first-person multiplayer game where you (or you and friends) play against others in a game of deception. Each team is attempting to unlock a vault to steal what's inside and successfully exit the map to win. The problem is — you're all in <em>disguise</em> and you can change your disguise constantly based on any of the NPCs running around the map.</p>
<p>On Linux and Steam Deck it works <em>great</em> with Proton out of the box. I did have a brief moment where it suddenly wouldn't work on desktop but another Proton Experimental update solved that. Additionally, the Steam Overlay seems to not work with it on desktop for me. It has Easy Anti-Cheat but the developers <em>have</em> enabled it for Linux and on Steam Deck it's rated Deck Verified with Proton 8.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5857764521690987102gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5857764521690987102gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - cover blown, another player found me.</em></p>
<p>Imagine if Among Us was a first-person shooter with a tiny bit of HITMAN vibes wrapped up in a very colourful and inviting style, and that <em>might</em> give you a slight idea of what to expect. I was really impressed at just how fun it is, which is surprising that on Steam it doesn't have a big player-base but it <em>does</em> also have full cross-platform multiplayer with consoles too and there's never been trouble finding a game.</p>
<p>You run around gathering intel data from various little devices spread across the map which allow you to unlock doors into buildings and unlock mini safes for character buffs. You can swap your disguise between civilians, guards, waiters, special guards, technicians and a VIP. You'll <em>need</em> to change up the disguise too, as certain people are only allowed in specific areas and if you have the wrong disguise on they will start firing at you. If you fire a weapon, your disguise will disappear as well until you wait a bit for it to come back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18546066831690987068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18546066831690987068gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - gathering intel to open some doors.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11872290351690986789gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11872290351690986789gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - about to grab a disguise.</em></p>
<p>The thing is you won't know if someone is an NPC or a player unless you really watch everyone closely to see what they're doing to catch them out (or if they're clearly not an NPC jumping across rooftops). When you're disguised, other players won't see your head move or or what direction you're looking, so you could be gathering intel or opening a door while facing another way - it has some clever design to it. NPCs will also do random actions, so you never really know who is who.</p>
<p>It's all about studying your surroundings, and trying to quickly grab enough intel to unlock the vault and potentially escape — which is easier said than done. Once you manage to steal the special item on the map, it will periodically ping your location giving other players an idea of where you are and no doubt people will try camping the exit.</p>
<p>Video of it on Steam Deck with some words from me:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nDaw6GJx_p8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac37f70c6f06d84d83477593ed7eee46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nDaw6GJx_p8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The gunplay in it doesn't feel anywhere near as good as some bigger games, you can definitely tell it's by a smaller studio but still good enough to be fun. Frantic in the team games where you're discovered by an enemy, but there's another enemy team that was also in the same area and — so much panic. Especially entertaining with all the different characters, each with their own abilities and weapons along with per-character progression.</p>
<p>Performance is absolutely not an issue on desktop Linux but on Steam Deck, you'll want to keep it on the Low preset as certain maps and action can drop it below 30FPS. Overall it still looks great on Low on the Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of fun and certainly something a bit different. Really worth picking up for both Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Been having a lot of fun in duos with family and a fair bit in the solo mode too.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft Connect broke again but Valve fixed it in Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Launchers. Gotta love 'em right? Major publishers just love to make Steam Deck and Linux gaming that little bit more difficult. Ubisoft Connect broke again but Valve is here to save the day.</p>
<p>You might have noticed recently your Ubisoft games stopped working with some kind of error message when trying to load. Thankfully it didn't take Valve long to solve, with a new release of Proton Experimental now live from August 1st with the single fix noted being "Fixed Ubisoft Connect not working after its recent update". So you'll just need to switch your Ubisoft games over to Proton Experimental to get them working again.</p>
<p>Just head to your Downloads and you should see an update ready for Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Here is For Honor now working for example:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zdbd2aclg3o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/60944c09038294582b5f3cbbf158feed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zdbd2aclg3o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam desktop and Steam Deck get a fresh stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another big stable update to the Steam client for desktop and Steam Deck. So here's a run over what's new and changed.</p>
<p>As usual, the changes between them are basically the same, although one does seem actually just for the Steam Deck which is where Valve fixed a case where the wrong FPS limit could be applied on startup. There's also these fixes and improvements just for Linux which will likely affect SteamOS on Steam Deck too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the controller input thread could operate at normal instead of high scheduling priority.</li>
<li>Fixed file dialogs not appearing in some cases for systems without an active xdg-desktop-portal</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash when processing shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the UI would show the wrong image when switching between small mode and normal mode.</li>
<li>Additional fixes for file dialogs for systems where xdg-desktop-portal is not available.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Added timer to the overlay. You can enable this button in the in-game settings.</li>
<li>Improved library performance for users with large numbers of collections.</li>
<li>Fixed some confirmation dialogs not closing with the cancel or X buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed "Clear Download Cache" also deleting cached login information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause a Steam Guard code to fail the first time it is entered, and then succeed immediately after that.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Overlay not respecting Windows scale factor for full screen windows at heights &lt;= 1200px.</li>
<li>Fixed Windows scale factors &lt;150% not applying to Steam overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed a hitch that some players with large libraries might encounter every 15 minutes while playing a game.</li>
<li>Fixed main client window taking focus from other Steam windows when navigation menus are hovered.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications for achievements not firing when offline.</li>
<li>Fixed wallet balance not updating in title bar when balance hits zero.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect display of "Notify me about additions or changes to my games..." setting in interface settings if it had never been changed before.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Library</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to sort by date added to library to shelves and game grids.</li>
<li>Added a setting to display Steam Deck compatibility information in the library while not on a Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Overlay</p>
<ul>
<li>Added In-Game setting to allow enabling or disabling display scaling in the overlay.</li>
<li>Changed behavior of overlay tabbed browser to clear all tabs when the close button is clicked and added a minimize button to hide the browser as the close button previously did.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent crash in overlay browser when switching to overlay for in-game purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation Controller can now use touchpad typing in the on-screen keyboard</li>
<li>Fixed presentation and localization of items in the Special Offers section.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved navigation in the configurator when navigating from the Preview screen. Repeatedly going to Preview then an input will no longer build up loops in the back stack and you can now go back with a single B button press if you've not interacted with the left column.</li>
<li>Added the ability to copy and paste button/axis mappings when setting up input for unrecognized controllers.</li>
<li>The selected controller configuration shown in the configurator should now update quicker and more reliably, including when exporting configs.</li>
<li>DualSense Wireless Controllers will now remain in DirectInput compatible mode over Bluetooth when Steam Input is disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where navigation changes from the previous beta could result in a blank page in the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed detecting controllers using the Xbox Enhanced Feature Support driver.</li>
<li>Fixed changing effects on PS4 and PS5 controllers when Steam Input is not enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Developer console</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a setting to display timestamps in the Steam console window.</li>
<li>Changed Steam console window to keep the last several seconds of output even if that would exceed the normal buffer length.</li>

</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">macOS</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed file chooser dialog not opening for some actions.</li>
<li>Fixed file chooser not allowing directories to be selected in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam app pulling focus back to the previous space when switching to a space without a Steam Client window on it.</li>
<li>Fixed app hiding not working with Steam Client windows.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Client windows not allowing dragging past the height of the titlebar on the main screen when running with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Fixed navigation menus not opening on mouse-over of buttons when the store or community browsers are focused.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelogs: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3678929205883183352" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3691314104878358313" target="_blank">Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>The new timer feature on the desktop overlay sounds very useful. Allowing you to set any time you want and then when it's done you'll get a ping and a pop-up notifying you time is up. Could be incredibly useful for reminding you to take an actual break.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4627081671690971579gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4627081671690971579gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/367030961690971580gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/367030961690971580gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - setting a timer, and then the timer going off in the top right.</em></p>
<p>I'm sure plenty of people who have both a PC and Steam Deck will also appreciate being able to see Steam Deck Verified ratings in their Steam Library as well. Available to turn on in Settings -&gt; Library -&gt; Show Steam Deck compatibility information in library. You can then hover over items or expand the details view on individual games.</p>

      <title>Linux overtakes macOS users on Steam thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well it finally happened. According to the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for July 2023 we can see that Linux users have overtaken macOS.</p>
<p>For July 2023 the rankings overall are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.21% -0.56%</li>
<li>macOS 1.84% +0.05%</li>
<li>Linux 1.96% +0.52%</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a> here's the Linux user share on Steam over time:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17191886191690970475gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17191886191690970475gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A pretty massive increase and the biggest in a single month for years. So why? Well, considering Valve just recently had a huge sale on the Steam Deck, it's probably not all that surprising. A lot of people over the last month will have been playing with their Steam Deck that ships with SteamOS Linux. So I do expect it to go down a fair bit next month as things settle down again but I imagine it will continue trending higher overall and keep pushing upwards.</p>
<p>Here's the current most popular Linux distributions - showing that SteamOS (Steam Deck) is the clear winner:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.07% +2.74%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.94% -0.39%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 7.38% -0.49%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.99% -0.03%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 4.29% -0.08%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 3.84% -0.71%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.97% +2.97%</li>
<li>Other 25.52% -4.02%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 on Steam Deck is &#39;absolutely wild&#39; and aims for 30FPS on Medium</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly exciting! Ahead of the release of Baldur's Gate 3, which is going to easily be one of the biggest releases this year, the Director of Publishing at Larian Studios teased playing it on Steam Deck on Twitter (uh, sorry on "X").</p>
<p>Michael Douse (Director of Publishing) said on in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685281446863265792" target="_blank">post</a> on X "Playing Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck is absolutely wild. The quality of models etc really holds up in cinematics. Can’t wait for you to try it" and in a follow-up reply to another user about performance Douse mentioned "We’re aiming for solid 30 on around medium, but optimisation is ongoing. Worth remembering we have cross-save between PC and PS5 ;)".</p>
<p>The good news is that it will also have full controller support at launch as well. However, no split-screen co-op on Steam Deck as that was <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1685989272099213312" target="_blank">disabled</a>. While you could hook it up to a bigger screen with a Docking Station, presumably this was done due to the lower power of the Deck.</p>

<p>Will you be picking it up? I've yet to hear back about a review key but I'm hoping to give it a run and see just how well it works on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It releases August 3rd.</p>

      <title>Rightfully, Beary Arms is an incredibly bizarre bullet-hell shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rightfully, Beary Arms is a weird and wonderfully whack twin-stick shooter rogue-lite that's now in Early Access with Native Linux support and it works on the Steam Deck too. <u>Note</u>: key provided by Stride PR.</p>
<p>Created by Daylight Basement Studio from Boston, North America, the cofounder Chris Bischke mentioned "Rightfully, Beary Arms was stitched and stuffed to be an enjoyable and approachable experience for both new and seasoned roguelite fans. Beary crushes the fears and anxieties kids face, and adults and children alike can cathartically squash our imagined aliens. Be like Beary!"</p>
<p>Well, they've definitely got a good start on something unique here. The style of it is quirky as heck, as are the weapons you can use and it's quite hilarious actually. Imagine something a bit like Enter the Gungeon only far more bizarre. There's lots of different weapons, you can upgrade weapons, you also get to pick and swap special abilities and as you get stronger - so do you enemies. However, you pick how your enemies get stronger here — really makes it interesting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gwDHcLr5uZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c434e6ba27582cb23b7fa871db9dcccb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gwDHcLr5uZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the Steam Deck there are some issues right now. The first is the initial loading time when starting a game, which feels like it takes forever. Some of the text on descriptions for things like weapons can also be a bit too small. Additionally, there are <em>numerous</em> rough performance blips where the game will stutter and drop so it's going to need some big optimizations to be something I would recommend there. The developer mentioned they'll be "making improvements to the Steam Deck Optimizations over the coming weeks". So I'll be checking back on it when they've done that.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux performance was much better of course, although the same drops can be seen but on a more powerful system with the FPS somewhere around 200FPS you don't even feel it.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of odd twin-stick rogue-lite shooters you'll enjoy this a <em>lot</em> but Steam Deck players will definitely want to wait for big optimizations. Delightfully silly so I look forward to seeing what they add during Early Access as they said the game only currently has half of the content they're planning. </p>

      <title>Parcel Simulator dev excited about Steam Deck support for you to find contraband</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Parcel Simulator is certainly not the type of game that would usually grab my attention but the Papers, Please inspiration and gameplay features look weirdly attractive. So now we too can run our own dream warehouse? Well, there's weirder games out there that got popular.</p>
<p>It's a first-person simulation and automation game, with a focus on parcel and package inspections for label discrepancies, contraband, and shipping defects. You take the role of a parcel sorting facility worker, working your way up to having a thriving, automated and self-sufficient parcel sorting centre, with automated conveyor belts, forklift trucks and storage racks, (+ a bunch of other cool stuff)!</p>
<p>Releasing in early 2024, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dg7qsNSO8Hw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f62dbef3583db53d9307ed7ba360ffb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dg7qsNSO8Hw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the solo developer Dan Yates of Scratchpost Studios they mentioned it will have full Steam Deck support. Clarifying with them if that meant Native Linux or support through Proton, and thoughts on desktop Linux support they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It'll be through Proton, as the build works really nicely that way for the project. In the same way, desktop Linux support will work fine with Proton too, but no native build planned as of yet.</p>
<p>I had a go a little while ago and was really impressed to see how nicely it worked out-the-box, and have since then focused on keeping the controller support working and also having the right graphics settings set up to keep the game running smoothly on the Deck!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asking Yates how it felt to develop a game with the Steam Deck they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've found it super exciting more than anything to be honest! Seeing your own game on a handheld like the Steam Deck for the first time is really cool as an otherwise PC-bound game dev.</p>
<p>Valve have done a stellar job making the Steam Deck super accessible for devs. As you know, under the hood it's just a Linux machine so it's really easy to transfer game builds onto it for testing. Proton works super nicely out-of-the-box too, and even on my very first build for the Deck it worked without any serious issues at all.</p>
<p>Development for a device like the Steam Deck (with its small screen and lower end hardware) has its challenges, but it's something I've been conscious about whilst developing:</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface and text scaling is something that's been super important for me, especially with all the text on labels and forms in Parcel Simulator. This isn't just limited to the Steam Deck either; people run games on all sorts of screen sizes and resolutions, so it's important that the text and UI are legible no matter what device you'll be playing the game on. It's easy enough to scale down my viewport whilst developing, or pop a quick build onto the Deck, to see how things look in reality from a player's point-of-view.</li>
<li>Performance is of course another thing worth mentioning. Parcel Sim definitely has a high-res feel about it, but because all the lighting is baked and the models have various LODs (level of detail) the performance ends up being really good, even on lower end hardware. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going into a little more detail on the work to ensure it performs well on Steam Deck and lower-end hardware Yates said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Baked lighting</strong> - baked lighting, as opposed to real-time lighting, means that the lighting information in the scene is calculated and saved before the game is installed on your device. This means that the lighting looks fantastic, but the hardware you’re running the game on doesn’t have to do any of the heavy lifting for rendering this lighting information. The scenes are still interlaced with some real-time lights, as just a few of these can make a world of difference for rendering real-time shadow information on objects that are spawned at runtime (such as parcels spawned in trucks, or conveyors built by players).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Level of Detail (LODs)</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> - 3D models are made up of polygons, a lot of polygons for that matter! The more polygons the engine (in my case Unreal Engine) has to render, the more performance this will require. When a player is far away from an object, or they’re running on reduced graphical settings, they don’t need to see the full polygon information for that object - instead it’d be totally fine for them to see a slightly less detailed version of the model. This is where LODs come in: all of the more complex 3D assets in Parcel Simulator have a few levels of LOD available, which means that these can be used as necessary whilst playing. If you can only see a conveyor belt from all the way on the other side of the warehouse on a couple pixels on your small screen, the game engine is better off rendering a much less detailed version of that conveyor belt to improve performance. This is especially true for the Steam Deck, as only the closest objects to the player need to be shown at their full level of complexity. Here’s an image of how LODs might look on a sphere:<br/>
<img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/991116211690813002gol1.png"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Object pooling</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> - no, not the swimming kind! In games, especially automation-flavoured games like Parcel Sim, there are lots and lots of objects being spawned at runtime. Object pooling is the practice of putting these dynamically spawned objects into a “pool” which can then be re-used later on in the game. Rather then despawning a parcel when submitting it and then spawning another identical parcel at the other end of the warehouse (an expensive operation), object pooling allows these spawned objects to simply be hidden, moved and made visible without any spawning or despawning taking place at all (from the engine’s perspective)! For anyone that’s played Factorio-style games before, object pooling is essential to keep the performance reasonable in large-scale factories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to being inspired by Papers, Please they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something oddly satisfying and addictive about cross-checking documents for issues in a video game! You know there’s always a chance that something could be incorrect, and so you’re checking and double checking for issues, hoping that you catch that small error or problem. Papers Please makes it easy enough to check through some basic passports at the start, but then quickly ramps up the difficulty in the later days, really keeping you on your toes. I loved that natural progression a lot, and I’ve tried to encompass that feeling in Parcel Sim - albeit with a 3D twist! The 3D aspect is something I saw a lot of potential for too, since it means that you’re able to go beyond document checks into the realm of opening up packages, performing interactive tests and checks on contents, and a bunch of other fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, on why they think you should buy it when it's out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Parcel Simulator, you begin with a small, hands-on facility where you can spend your days manually inspecting parcels for contraband and labelling issues, or developing and expanding your warehouse with automated machines and intricate conveyor systems. With the help of some careful automation, you can watch your facility grow into a thriving sorting centre that operates exactly how you want it to. Through meticulous parcel inspections and in-depth warehouse customisation, Parcel Simulator aims to provide endlessly satisfying gameplay to casual and experienced players alike. Parcel Simulator will be releasing to Steam in Q1 of 2024, with a demo due to be released later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All sounds great and it certainly now has my curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424010/Parcel_Simulator/" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a> if it sounds interesting for you.</p>

      <title>DevilutionX for classic Diablo and Hellfire now on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a perhaps easier way to get DevilutionX for classic Diablo running on Steam Deck and desktop Linux? Well it's now on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.diasurgical.DevilutionX" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. This means on Steam Deck, you can just grab DevilutionX from Discover and install it there. For desktop Linux - whatever way you would normally install a Flatpak from Flathub.</p>
<p>DevilutionX is a source port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game on modern operating systems while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features. This includes support for higher resolutions, controller and touch control support, stash, optional experience and enemy health bars and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8275788091690801061gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8275788091690801061gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Diablo with DevilutionX on Linux</em></p>
<p>With the Flathub release it comes with the demo content, so you can at least try it out. But you do need to buy a copy of Diablo to run the full game with it - which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo" target="_blank">purchase from GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you do pick up the full game you can copy over "DIABDAT.MPQ" to:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.diasurgical.DevilutionX/data/diasurgical/devilution</code></p>
<p>As for Hellfire you need to copy "hellfire.mpq", "hfmonk.mpq", "hfmusic.mpq" and "hfvoice.mpq" to the same location.</p>
<p><em>DevilutionX did already offer an AppImage but some people may prefer the Flatpak.</em></p>

      <title>Tactical RPG &#39;Arcadian Atlas&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcadian Atlas is a 2D isometric tactical role playing game about the choices people make in pursuit of the things they love, and the havoc it wreaks on a kingdom. It looks great with some wonderful pixel-art for fans of games like Final Fantasy Tactics. </p>
<p>Available now with Native Linux support and while it has no official Steam Deck rating yet it should work great, with the developer regularly testing it prior to release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to save Arcadia, players need to build an elite party of adventurers from more than 12 unique classes, each with their own custom skill trees and equipment ranging from potion-brewing apothecaries to magic-channeling warmancers. Strategic, turn-based battles will determine the fate of both the kingdom of Arcadia and its people. Every single action counts: just one wrong move could tear your party and the land itself apart for good.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4sUwpVQrDPM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5f6cec342f5caef7541b85d53a2e7bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4sUwpVQrDPM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/arcadian-atlas-developer-interview/" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> also recently interviewed the developer. Here's an interesting excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I know that a native Linux version of the game will be released as well. Were there any challenges unique to developing for Linux over Windows or Mac?</strong></p>
<p>Paddy, our programmer, hit the ground running with Linux from the outset, and we were constantly cognizant of both Linux and Mac needs while developing within Unity to ensure we could deliver stellar experiences across all three platforms. And Unity makes that incredibly easy as well, to the point where we were pretty shocked there weren’t more issues taking a Windows build to Mac or Linux, but the process was relatively painless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Land - Travel through the vast and beautiful landscape of Arcadia, battling across dozens of maps including ancient ruins, seaside villages, snow-capped mountains, and verdant forests.</li>
<li>Engage in Strategic Battles - Utilize 150+ unique combat skills to shift the tides of the battlefield. Deploy tactical traps, use magic to buff your soldiers’ abilities, and exploit your enemies’ weaknesses to gain victory.</li>
<li>Rally the Troops - Build an army from 12 different classes; customize their mastery across 25 unique skill trees; and arm them with weapons, armor, and powerful accessories to amplify their abilities.</li>
<li>Experience the Masterpiece - Enjoy the exquisite ambiance of Arcadia with an inspired jazz-infused soundtrack and detailed art nouveau-style character portraits.</li>
<li>Discover the Epic Narrative - As fates intertwine, the heart-wrenching stories of Vashti, Desmond, and all of Arcadia unfold in this rich tale of war and magic across 70+ unique campaign encounters.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/691790/Arcadian_Atlas/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Broforce FOREVER arrives for the legendary action platformer on August 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably my absolutely favourite action platformer for the over time action and hilarious characters, Broforce is set for the Broforce FOREVER update on August 8th.</p>
<p>This is the final update to the game so the forever naming sees appropriate. It will offer up "an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra-patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j3J3zLLnRU0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3cd7b73b0fb411e1b270409db1182a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j3J3zLLnRU0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new BROS being added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Seth Brondle</strong> - Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of <em>Broforce Forever’s</em> biggest bug yet. Climb on ceilings and utilize explosive teleportation as you swat evildoers like flies.</p>
<p><strong>Xebro</strong> - Use your formidable fighting and flying Chakram skills to help those who are unable to defend themselves. Strike fear into the hearts of terrorism with your war cry, then cut them up real good with your sword.</p>
<p><strong>Desperabro</strong> - Harness the power of music to enchant evil before blowing it away with dual-sawed-off shotguns. Every man deserves one last chance to dance before he dies.</p>
<p><strong>Broffy the Vampire Slayer</strong> - Become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake-throwing, unholy monster purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer.</p>
<p><strong>Bro Gummer</strong> - Embrace freedom in the most patriotic way possible: OVERKILL. Snipe your way around the world vanquishing evil with pinpoint accuracy, or just get back to basics and ram dynamite down its throat.</p>
<p><strong>Demolition Bro</strong> - Send a maniac to catch a maniac. With his Bouncing Bomberman Bomb and Freeze Grenade, this Bro is ready to put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bunch of new enemies will also appear including motorbikes that try to run you down, large machine gun placements, and something about aviation enthusiasts that transport troops and fire bazookas from on high in their liberty-shunning new blimps. Level design adjustments too including a bunch of new barbed wire and sandbags strewn throughout cities making things a lil more challenging in places.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/broforce?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/broforce" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Broforce has a Native Linux version and it is also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress publisher Kitfox helping roguelike Caves of Qud to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud from Freehold Games is probably the absolutely wildest roguelike I've ever played and now the developers are teaming up with Dwarf Fortress publisher Kitfox Games to publishing it with the final release in 2024.</p>
<p>This is great news because Caves of Qud is truly excellent, and more people deserve to know about it and experience it. With publishing help, the developers can focus more on polishing the 1.0 release! Thanks to the partnership Qud also has a fancy trailer now:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2c6burNvtsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd58887074390f4c94399bd41f6b179.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2c6burNvtsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The partnership makes sense on so many levels,” says Jason Grinblat, co-founder at Freehold Games. “First, Tanya is one of our oldest friends in the industry, and we've already worked with her on a few non-game projects. Second, we love what Kitfox has been doing over the past few years, both as an inspiring indie developer and as a publisher carving out a really distinctive niche. And third, of course: <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. Few games have had as big an impact on <em>Caves of Qud</em> as DF. It's humbling to be mentioned alongside the legend, and it's delightful to lock arms with our friends and some of our favorite devs ever, Tarn &amp; Zach Adams.”</p>
<p>"We've always loved <em>Caves of Qud</em> as an alternate-dimension take on deep world simulation, where a skilled writer prioritized certain elements of atmosphere at every turn in the design,” says Kitfox Captain, Tanya X. Short. “So when we heard Kitfox could help Qud get to 1.0, we leapt at the chance. It's a crime that not enough <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> fans have heard of this cousin, an underrated gem of a game made by lovely people, and we hope we can help spread the word to those who would adore it."</p>
<p>You can buy it right now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/caves_of_qud" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>I love the animated ASCII artwork in Stone Story RPG - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some really fun animated ASCII artwork, Stone Story RPG is a really interesting mixture of an auto-RPG with strategic combat, crafting, programming and more. An incredibly unique game where descriptions and screenshots really don't tell you enough, you need to watch it and experience it to actually get it. Just be careful, this one is easy to get lost in for hours and hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14232091981690637656gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14232091981690637656gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Stone Story is an RPG set in a dark and ominous world. Monsters and mysteries plague the realm. Embark on a quest to unite 9 magic Soul Stones and restore the light.</p>
<p>The game takes elements from various genres and repackages them into a wholly unique experience. One of Stone Story's defining mechanics is that you have no direct control of the player character, as an A.I. does all the exploring, combat and looting. Though this is an auto-RPG, that doesn't mean it's an idle game. Potions and special abilities are maximized by good timing. Boss fights are intense, requiring quick item swaps if the boss changes patterns.</p>
<p>Your natural curiosity will be your greatest tool as you delve into the game and discover there's more beneath its deceptively simple surface."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dBQRsjNwuNM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8e72ae4703ad280b3fa7675becd0a4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dBQRsjNwuNM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After nearly a decade of development, the 1.0 release is here now. Although, they're clearly not done with it. The developer said to expect to continue seeing updates adding in additional mechanics to new events, new items, new difficulties, new locations and more.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stunning ASCII animation and gorgeous music</li>
<li>Robust player A.I. that combines with other game systems to offer a unique experience for gamers of all types</li>
<li>8 unique Locations, each with their own meticulously detailed environments and intense boss fights</li>
<li>Simple, but deep crafting system</li>
<li>Dozens of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategies</li>
<li>A rich fantasy world with eccentric enemies, amusing NPC encounters and engaging lore</li>
<li>8+ hours of main story gameplay, in addition to procedurally generated content</li>
<li>Plenty of secrets!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603390/Stone_Story_RPG/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Also available as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/26121/Linux__Thrills/" target="_blank">LINUX &amp; THRILLS bundle</a> on Steam.</p>

      <title>For Honor from Ubisoft gets an anti-cheat update - now Playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more bigger publisher jumping in to get their games working on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Ubisoft has now upgraded For Honor to support Easy Anti-Cheat on Deck.</p>
<p>Published in their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/for-honor/news-updates/6jz99oXbJUVyK5h17fp6B8/patch-notes-2451-for-honor" target="_blank">July 27th update</a> it notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EASY ANTI-CHEAT </p>
<p>Updated Easy Anti-Cheat client module and library. <br/>
Developer's Comment:* This update of Easy Anti-Cheat makes the game playable on Steam Deck.* </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to that, Valve also ran the game through verification bumping it up to a Steam Deck Playable rating with Proton Experimental (as seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/304390/history/?changeid=19683830" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) as it was previously Unsupported. It's Playable now and <em>not</em> Verified as Valve notes it still has issues with a launcher, it can show non-Steam Deck controller icons, you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and it doesn't close properly so you need to force-close on it.</p>
<p>So Ubisoft have done the <em>bare minimum</em> to make it work. Hopefully they will also address the other issues to get it bumped up to Verified properly.</p>
<p>Trying it myself: it did initially get completely stuck sitting on a Uplay "Looking for patches" screen for a long time. Closing and reopening then just fixed it and it did it almost instantly. Logging into to Ubisoft Account also did need the touchscreen and manual on-screen keyboard (STEAM + X). After that logging in worked just fine, although it then gave me the full Ubisoft Connect app instead of launching the game. Closing and re-opening it then asked me for a CD Key, which is apparently a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/304390/discussions/0/3807281795250711046/" target="_blank">problem for many people</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/304390/discussions/0/3807281795249566983/" target="_blank">even more people</a> even though it's supposed to be having a free weekend.</p>
<p>So, for science, I <em>purchased</em> the game. Thinking that would give me the needed key. Apparently that <em>doesn't work</em> either and I am also not alone in that problem. Seems they're having problems with their CD Key server so it may very well be supported on Steam Deck now but any <em>new</em> purchases or free weekend players are stuck until they fix it.</p>
<p>Third-party launchers on Steam are bad enough but third-party key generation is even worse. What a mess.</p>
<p><strong>Update - 31/07/23</strong>: they did eventually fix the key issue, so I have been able to actually get in and confirm the game does indeed work now on Steam Deck. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5580871331690815061gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5580871331690815061gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304390/FOR_HONOR/" target="_blank">play it free on Steam</a> until August 3rd and it's also 80% off during this time.</em></p>

      <title>Persona 5 Strikers fully playable on Steam Deck with this tweak</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since its release in October 2022, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a> has been one of the perfect Steam Deck games. Persona 5 Royal's design being very well suited for handheld play; combined with being a very well optimized PC Port overall. Its sequel / spin-off, Persona 5 Strikers, has not fared so well. Despite launching on Steam in February 2021, well before Persona 5 Royal, Persona 5 Strikers is still listed as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While Strikers has been mostly playable, cutscene audio didn't play and given that Strikers carries the story heavy design of Persona, that might as well be unplayable. However, thanks to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1382330#03yxM1tHaR" target="_blank">Swish on Proton DB</a>, this issue has been resolved and Persona 5 Strikers can be played start to end on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10381937151690488954gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10381937151690488954gol15416.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - The Cold Open of Persona 5 Strikers Tested on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>In order to implement this fix, you'll need to set Compatibility to GE Proton 8 (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GE-Proton Guide</a>). I personally used 8-3 but you might be able to use newer versions. After that you'll need to enter this code into your launch options: </p>
<p><code>GST_PLUGIN_FEATURE_RANK=protonaudioconverterbin:NONE %command%</code></p>
<p>Once done you can test it by just starting a new game as the game immediately hits you with an anime cutscene. </p>
<p>My testing showed that I could run Strikers at a stable 60 fps on mid settings and the Steam Performance Overlay showed a two-to-three-hour battery life from a 90% charge. This beats out the Switch version, which could only do 30 fps, and puts the Deck on par with the PS4 version running on PS5.</p>
<p>Given the fast-paced hack and slash design of Strikers compared to Royal's turn-based design, 60 fps is more important here than it was in Royal. Keep that in mind if you decide to cut back settings to save battery life. I did experiment with the settings and found that 40 fps was still smooth, but 30 fps was just too far back.</p>

      <title>Combat-free RPG set in an occult library BOOK OF HOURS launches August 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing on August 17th from developer Weather Factory, BOOK OF HOURS is an "elegant, melancholy, combat-free RPG set in an occult library" and it certainly looks <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>From the creator of Cultist Simulator, it's going to offer up they say around 20 - 40 hours of sweet peace as you organise books and customise your new home, all while peeling away centuries of history from the occult stones about you. Sounds peculiar and quite interesting.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new final trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="38D565xKp-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07d8dc4778c4c32bad9417c492edff6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/38D565xKp-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the game you will:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACQUIRE, RESTORE and CATALOGUE</strong> occult books, scrolls and curiosities.</li>
<li><strong>STUDY the nine Wisdoms</strong>, and conquer the nine Elements of the Soul.</li>
<li><strong>GUIDE visitors who come seeking your assistance</strong>, choosing their paths and stories.</li>
<li><strong>EXPLORE the Secret Histories</strong> and the pantheon of Hours that rules them.</li>
<li><strong>RESTORE a vast crumbling edifice</strong> built on the foundations of an ancient abbey.</li>
<li><strong>WREST your past from obscurity.</strong> Choose from nine different Legacies which determine who you are. You might be a Magnate, abandoning wealth to seek peace. Or an Archaeologist, fleeing the curse you awoke. Or perhaps your origins are more esoteric, like the Symurgist, or Twiceborn? Each playthrough offers different opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to Lottie Bevan of Weather Factory via email, they confirmed Linux support very clearly just like their previous game mentioning "Absolutely. It'll be available on native Linux at launch. :)".</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/book_of_hours" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1028310/BOOK_OF_HOURS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on August 17th.</p>

      <title>Homeworld Remastered Collection and Severed Steel are free on Epic Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a space-nerd, I couldn't miss telling you that you can grab the <em>entire</em> Homeworld Remastered Collection free on Epic Games right now.</p>
<p>Thanks to Wine / Proton, they're all playable on Linux and Steam Deck too. Grabbing games from Epic on Linux is trivial nowadays too thanks to the excellent Heroic Games Launcher (which just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/heroic-games-launcher-29-out-now-with-amazon-games-support/" target="_blank">had a big update</a>). Homeworld Remastered Collection is rated Steam Deck Unsupport (but it works) but it was rated as Playable previously, and it's also rated Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/244160" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the new demo for Aurora: The Lost Medallion - The Cave</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aurora: The Lost Medallion - The Cave is an upcoming coming-of-age tale of destiny, friendship, and discovery. From Noema Games and Gamera Games, it's a hand-painted point and click adventure that will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You are Aurora, the youngest inhabitant of the Cave. Raised by intelligent machines in a hidden world of technological wonders, a group of kids spend their days preparing for the mysterious “Pilgrimage”, each guided by an equally mysterious voice. As the only child without a Voice to guide her, Aurora must challenge the rigid society of the Cave to gain the title of Pilgrim and embark on an adventure to answer the unsolved question of her origins. The developers said the new demo should give you around an hour of gameplay, but a bit longer if you find some of the puzzles challenging.</p>

      <title>Open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver &#39;NVK&#39; gears up for merging into Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is exciting as heck! Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand and various contributors have been powering through developing NVK, the open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA.</p>
<p>It's come along rather nicely in such a short time, that they're now preparing to have it actually merged into Mesa along with the rest of the open source graphics for Linux.</p>
<p>A majority of the work was done by Ekstrand with Collabora, with Karol Herbst from Red Hat also doing "a lot of the ground work and has done a lot of debugging and figuring out what we need to do on various generations", plus Dave Airlie of Red Hat also doing a bunch of needed Linux kernel work.</p>
<p>What's the current status? According to the draft it has a "pretty solid set at this point" which Google Summer of Code developer Mohamed Ahmed working through YCbCr support and when that is done it should have Vulkan 1.2 support with plenty of features on top of that.</p>
<p>Currently they don't have everything needed for DXVK, VKD3D-Proton and Zink but they've got "most" of it. So perhaps it won't be too long until NVIDIA GPU owners can use Mesa to run Vulkan games, that would be pretty amazing.</p>
<p>As for hardware support, Collabora told me: “Initially, Turing (20XX and 16XX series) and later. Eventually, we want to go as far back as Kepler (6XX and 7XX series)”.</p>
<p>Their plan is to get it merged into Mesa once the Linux kernel patches are ready, so you'll need a newer or patched kernel to actually make use of NVK.</p>
<p>You can see the draft <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24326" target="_blank">merge request here</a> and <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/next-step-for-nvk-merging-into-mesa.html" target="_blank">Collabora announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Goodbye free time I have discovered Timberborn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A city-building colony-sim where a bunch of Beavers are building a society long after us pesky humans died off is not a thing I thought I needed but Timberborn is properly great. <u>Note</u>: key provided by Evolve PR.</p>
<p>It's playable on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with Proton, with it working without issues with Proton 8. On the Steam Deck specifically, it's rated as "Playable" due to the controls not being gamepad friendly and needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>While it's similar in many ways to other city-builders on a basic level, the game feels a lot more wholesome thanks to your furry friends running around doing all the work. And while the basics of it are similar to other city-builders, it pretty quickly becomes its own game thanks to the very clever vertical building system that can take a good bit of time to really understand properly to make use of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15481922951690302224gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15481922951690302224gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Timberborn on Fedora KDE 38, running smooth!</em></p>
<p>This actually nicely reminds me of playing through some of the early The Settlers games. This isn't just a city-builder though. It's also a game of survival, a colony-builder where you're responsible for keeping a whole bunch of critters alive through some tough times. The early game is very much "aww, little Beavers cutting down some trees" and it's slightly hilarious seeing Beavers work a farm which later evolves into "oh my god another drought, they're all going to die". </p>
<p>In terms of performance on my desktop with Fedora KDE 38 using an AMD Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti, on max settings it's been a very smooth 60FPS the entire time. Absolutely no issues with performance and I've yet to see any issues at all with it there. The developers have certainly done a good job on optimization, even when there's a ridiculous amount of moving parts and it shows how good Proton is nowadays for all types of gaming on Linux too.</p>
<p>All the <em>little</em> details I've simply <em>loved</em> seeing here. It's the simple things like how building power lines isn't just straight cables. Say you need a corner, well you'll get two opposing cogs turning to keep it going. Such delightful design.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18100526811690303329gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's a lot to it and you don't get a whole lot in the way of an introduction, which in this case is actually quite good. The tutorial that's around an hour long gives you the real basic setup of how to become a little bit self-sufficient. As soon as you are, it waves goodbye and leaves you to fend off the elements. That first time you get a drought come in too — wow that was unexpected and it happens quickly too.</p>
<p>Getting to grips with how to effectively keep your Beavers alive through all the droughts is quite a learning curve. Learning how to properly manage water storage, building dams and properly routing it around your colony. It's easier said than done, or perhaps I'm just not as smart as your average Beaver. The reality is that Timberborn is a city-builder where everything revolves around the basics of water. If you don't have a supply of it your crops will die, trees will die, your Beavers will get thirsty and die and the ground just becomes a wasteland. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4469551681690306826gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4469551681690306826gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Eventually though, you will learn how to manage water through the droughts and once you do, the game opens up a whole lot more because it's less of a panic about staying alive. Then the real fun begins, because then you get to build a really big dam to expand what water you can control on the map, and let it flow once it's built-up to keep flowing downstream so you can keep power flowing too. However, you do need to ensure you've got some barriers in place because water finds a way…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4272230621690308625gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4272230621690308625gol1.jpg"/></a>Oops.</em></p>
<p>For Steam Deck the experience is actually quite surprising. It works out of the box but the text and interface is a little on the small side. Thankfully, it has UI scaling in the settings and sticking it up to the max at 140% made it basically perfection. I shouldn't be impressed when a game has UI scaling but sadly it's still rare even in a lot of new releases now, so it's just nice to see it in an unfinished game working so well like in Timberborn.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16393047561690400016gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16393047561690400016gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance is the other surprising thing. Even with lots going on, on Ultra details it was hitting 60FPS without a problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1062090/view/6083844525375414462" target="_blank">Back in May</a> the developers released Update 4, and in the release notes they mentioned performance was improved by "by up to 80%" and it really shows even on some of the big busy maps. Even with no official controller support, thanks to the easy interface it feels just about fine with Steam Input emulating a mouse / keyboard and quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Timberborn <em>isn't</em> finished since it's Early Access but what's there can already give you multiple tens of hours of gameplay, and easily into the 100s of hours depending on what type of gamer you are. There's so many different ways to build up a Beaver colony in this game it could just keep you entertained forever.</p>
<p>You also have modding support in the game currently <a href="https://mod.io/g/timberborn" target="_blank">via mod.io</a>, with a full map editor included in the game so there's a fair amount you can add into the game as extras too. Eventually the developer said they do plan to hook up the Steam Workshop too but no ETA on that.</p>
<p>If you're after a game to sink your big teeth into and chomp away for hours, Timberborn is a great choice. </p>
<p>Available to buy in Early Access on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/timberborn?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/timberborn" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Learn to make no-code games with GDevelop and Fanatical</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to make games but don't know how to code? The free and open source <a href="https://gdevelop.io/" target="_blank">GDevelop</a> is a great cross-platform tool with an events-driven system.</p>
<p>Something I've covered a few times here on GamingOnLinux because I <em>love</em> the idea of it, and I grew up making little games in similar tools like the classic The Games Factory and Clickteam Fusion. It's pretty fun to just test things out in GDevelop, and you can throw something together pretty quickly with it.</p>
<p>They've <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/easy-no-code-game-design-bundle?ref=gol" target="_blank">teamed up with Fanatical</a> offer a growing<em>*</em> bundle of assets and a 6 month subscription to their Silver Premium plan that gives you some added extras like cloud building, cloud projects, a mobile app and more extras that you may find helpful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19680424981690381771gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19680424981690381771gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7055095631690381773gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7055095631690381773gol1.png"/></a><br/>

<p>GDevelop is constantly improving too and since it's cross-platform, free and open source you can try it any time.</p>
<p><em>*Fanatical say to keep an eye out "for new additions to this bundle in future as there's so much more to come with GDevelop &amp; Fanatical".</em></p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets another update with lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Summer Event live until September 15th, 2023 it seems Valve still aren't quite done updating Team Fortress 2 with the renewed popularity. Team Fortress 2 managed to smash its all time player record at 253,997 around 2 weeks ago, but it's settled back down to around 100,000 now.</p>
<p>Still, the updates aren't yet the kind of thing many were hoping for after Valve originally said the recent update would be a "full-on update-sized update" and then later changed it to say it was a "full-on holiday-sized update". At least they're giving it <em>some</em> attention though right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17134057931690380475gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17134057931690380475gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Armored Core VI will be &#39;fully supported&#39; on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay now THIS is exciting as heck. Armored Core VI Fires Of Rubicon will be "fully supported" on Steam Deck according to FromSoftware.</p>
<p>As mentioned in an article on <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/armored-core-6-fully-supported-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a> who spoke to Game Director Masaru Yamamura, and producer Yasunori Ogura, with Ogura revealing "Obviously seeing how well Elden Ring performed on the Steam Deck, we were very happy, and we wanted to at least create that as a baseline going forward for this handheld. So it is fully supported for Steam Deck … we just want to reassure players that it will be fully supported."</p>
<p>There's also a brand new gameplay preview video out:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DcDjyestr4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2ea5156c0158b316d23de45b419aa1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DcDjyestr4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining FromSoftware’s longstanding expertise in mech games with their signature action gameplay, ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON brings a brand-new action experience to the series.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dynamic, Omni-directional Battles</strong><br/>
Players will pilot their mech in fast-paced, omni-directional battles, taking advantage of massive stages and their mech’s mobility on land and in the air to ensure victory.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Customized Parts for Individual Battle Styles</strong><br/>
Customize Armored Core parts to suit a large variety of playstyles. Selecting different parts not only changes the mech’s attacks, but also directly affects its movement and battle style, so each mission can be approached with a unique mech strategy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Thrilling Boss Battles</strong><br/>
Deploy a wide variety of offensive and defensive tactics at close and long range to take down powerful enemy bosses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really can't tell you how excited I am by this one. A proper big-budget mech game, it looks like everything I've wanted in such a game for years. You can absolutely bet I will be taking a look at this one on desktop Linux and Steam Deck for the release! Will you be picking it up too?</p>
<p>It releases on August 24th with pre-purchase available on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888160/ARMORED_CORE_VI_FIRES_OF_RUBICON/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is Steam Deck Verified and out today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is great to see. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart from Insomniac Games, Nixxes Software and PlayStation is out on Steam today and it's Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>You can read a little more on the work behind the Windows PC release on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/18/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-specs-and-new-features-revealed/" target="_blank">PlayStation blog</a> from last week. On Steam Deck and desktop Linux it will run with the Proton compatibility layer, specifically Valve set the Steam Deck Verified status to use Proton Experimental.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i_jZ3BV6Adc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b79677925a79e6c335f481dee2ffec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i_jZ3BV6Adc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully this means it has been <em>properly</em> tested with a smooth 30FPS at a <em>minimum</em>. As we've seen quite a few times though, some titles seem to get Verified for Steam Deck even though they clearly have glaring issues. Like our friends at SteamDeckHQ <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ/status/1684144428511035392" target="_blank">pointing out</a> the Verified title Remnant II having <em>really</em> bad performance.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Join the heroes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Employ an epic arsenal of explosive weapons, including the Burst Pistol, Topiary Sprinkler and the Shatterbomb.</li>
<li>Zip above cityscapes, boost into combat and slip through dimensions with physics-defying new gadgets.</li>

<ul>

</ul>

      <title>The Warhammer themed boomer-shooter, Boltgun, is finally Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest game to ride the boomer shooter craze, Warhammer 40K: Boltgun, has finally attained Steam Deck Verification as of today according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2005010/view/3660914264336762646?l=english" target="_blank">its own Steam Page</a>.</p>
<p>Since release, Boltgun<em> </em>was playable but users reported issues from cut-scenes not playing, the Deck not being recognized as a controller, and inconsistent performance issues. While the game has been reported as fully playable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/warhammer-40000-boltgun-now-fully-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">since early July</a>, you still had to install Proton 8. No more however, as Boltgun just runs out of the box with no configuration.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11419653141690307030gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11419653141690307030gol15416.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured: Boltgun running on Steam Deck post verification.</em></p>
<p>As I was in the midst of a Boltgun run, I downloaded it to my Deck and sure enough the first cutscene played and the Deck was recognized as a controller. Then I went to my last unlocked mission, Chapter 3 Mission 1, which is filled with lava and tons of enemies. Sure enough, Boltgun maintained a smooth 60fps. Which if you're not familiar with Boomer Shooters, maintaining a smooth 60fps is basically a requirement.</p>
<p>You can see Liam's past coverage here:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rc6MG0-vKrQ?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/948262fdfafb811992d1864cdf0cafc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rc6MG0-vKrQ?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That said, this is the kind of game that plays better on Mouse and Keyboard. But that's more of a nitpick and doesn't affect it being able to be played On Deck. Simply put: if you've been wanting to spread the word of the Emperor in an ultra-violent fashion on the go now's your chance.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/warhammer-40000-boltgun?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Mr. Run and Jump from Atari and Graphite Lab is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally created for the Atari 2600 back in 2021 (yes, really), Mr. Run and Jump has been recreated properly for modern systems from Atari and Graphite Lab. Seems it caught Atari's eye if they wanted to team up to remake it in full. Like a lot of recent games published by Atari, it also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>What is it? A very vibrant and colourful precision-platformer, one for those of you who like a good challenge. More: "Thrust into the beautiful Realms of Color, the titular Mr. Run and Jump embarks on a fast-paced, fluorescent adventure to defeat the menacing Void and rescue his missing dog, Leap. This title demands players use their wits as well as their dexterity. Mr. Run and Jump features precise controls, silky smooth gameplay, and free-flowing level design, making it a speedrunner’s dream.

      <title>Check out the upgraded demo for Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is an upcoming squad tactics heist RPG, from Trese Brothers who created Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce.</p>
<p>The developer previously put up a demo for the last Steam Next Fest, but now with the Steam Stealth Fest live they decided to not only keep the demo up but they've expanded and fixed up the demo based on a lot of feedback they directly received from the previous event.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19353145881690289993gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19353145881690289993gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I spent a bit of time in the demo and came away quite impressed. It feels really slick, with a nice mixture of abilities across the different types of characters. Everything about it feels a lot <em>smoother</em> compared with the likes of XCOM too and their Native Linux build of the demo has been running great on max settings too.</p>
<p>All the changes since the last demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Security AI's thoughts and actions are visible between turns</li>
<li>Roster is now unlocked to view characters (customization still locked)</li>
<li>Check out recruits in the roster before hiring on to team</li>
<li>Heist Advantages now available</li>
<li>New UI for Victory/Defeat use the mission map from mission planning</li>
<li>Improved SFX around moving</li>
<li>Fixed bug where Sec Tally did not immediately respond to camera spotting</li>
<li>Improved Rooftop level objective area</li>
<li>Fixed issues that could cause hunting AI to skip turns at times</li>
<li>Rebuilt mission victory and defeat screens</li>
<li>Medkits and other healing effects show their effect in the target's HP bar</li>
<li>Improved sensitivity of mouse rotation (right click, rotate)</li>
<li>Damage from grenades is immediately visible as the mouse is moved to target them</li>
<li>Improved colors in HP bars to make the damage done always visible every single frame</li>
<li>Improved performance of mission map hovers - will never lag behind or skip off target when panning or rotating</li>
<li>Cleaned up very small "skip" at the end of most character's movements</li>
<li>Active Buffs and Debuffs have correct icons and duration shown in character and enemy hovers</li>
<li>Improved visual clarity of potential damage in target's Health Bar, no frames where the value can't be seen</li>
<li>Improved Cameras and Radar Array to be more accurate in their detection</li>
<li>Improved logic as to which enemy agents can be called off their current duty by security events</li>
<li>Combat logs for Cameras and Radar Arrays include the character name that was spotted specifically</li>
<li>Fixed bug where enemy could take 3+ Overwatch shots in some situations</li>
<li>Fixed bug with Vanguard's Overdrive Talent, guard who spots her might not stop moving immediately</li>
<li>Fixed bug where engaging movement Talents like Cybersword "Lightfoot" did not update warnings about heard in movement path</li>
<li>Fixed control issue where Talents like Cybersword "Lightfoot" would not allow you to toggle Sprint/Sneak</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing aggro enemies to move to the far side of players when repositioning for attack</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing aggro enemies capable of attacking a player to freeze and not move for the turn</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing enemy agents to freeze in some security situations</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing enemy agents to teleport in some security situations</li>
<li>Fixed bug when reloading save, an enemy agent might start acting while cut-scene is running</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing target circle to be hidden with Charged Attack / Conduit Edge melee attacks</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing inconsitent "out of range" results when clicking an enemy vs. clicking Talent</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing Hunker buff to automatically activate if player starts Overwatch or if player dies from enemy Overwatch</li>
<li>Fixed bug where characters and enemies might start to float slightly off the ground after moving a few times</li>
<li>Fixed bug allowing you to run through the doorframe of small doors</li>
<li>Fixed bug allowing you to stand in the railing of elevators</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect keybinding shown on ESC menu, fixed Enter is really "Delay or End Action"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not just that, they've also announced some more release info. While their estimate may change, they're now saying the release is likely to happen around the start of Q4 instead of near the end of Q3. So it's most likely to arrive towards the start of October 2023. So a little bit longer to wait but clearly it will be worth it with how they're reacting and improving based on the feedback from the demo.</p>
<p>As a big fan of squad-based tactical games (hello XCOM), I'm very keen to see the finished product here.</p>

      <title>Devs of Superior: Vengeance detail their Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Superior: Vengeance is an Early Access hyper-stylized superhero third-person co-op shooter, and the good news for Steam Deck players is the developer is ensuring it works great.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ck4IMUeO-is"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fb7f8cceaf8e9b688596bd1fee619b1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ck4IMUeO-is" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1297490/view/3659787820511285039" target="_blank">update on Steam</a>, they've noted how they've submitted it for verification but they've also been working on the game and testing it on Steam Deck to ensure it all works properly. With the latest update here's what they said they've done and what the status is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck/controller icons:  We have integrated Steam Deck and controller icons within the game, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive gaming experience.</p>
<p>Seamless functionality: Superior: Vengeance has been optimized to ensure that all functionality is accessible when using the default controller configuration. You’ll be able to dive right into the action without any hassle.</p>
<p>On screen keyboard support: When joining a lobby, you can easily enter text by manually invoking the on-screen keyboard</p>
<p>Optimal performance: Superior: Vengeance runs at a resolution supported by the Steam Deck, ensuring crisp visuals and smooth gameplay. The default graphics configuration has been fine-tuned to perform well on the device.</p>
<p>Legible interface: All in-game interface text has been carefully designed to be legible on the Steam Deck’s screen, so you won’t need to squint or strain your eyes to read important information.</p>
<p>Initial setup and gameplay: An active internet connection is required for the initial setup and for all gameplay modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, they said how they're "committed to delivering the best experience possible both on and off the Steam Deck" - so we can expect it to continue working well as it's developed through Early Access.</p>
<p>Great to see more developers take an active role in ensuring Steam Deck support. Which also means it should work great on desktop Linux too if it performs well on Deck. Seems they will have more to do though, like making the on-screen keyboard actually be automatic but it's a nice start.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.9 out now with Amazon Games support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making it easier than ever to grab all your games, the Heroic Games Launcher version 2.9.0 is out now and this brings with it Amazon Games support.</p>
<p>If you have Amazon Prime, you get a bunch of games each month to claim through Prime Gaming and no doubt some of you have built up quite a collection right? Now you can just grab them on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with Heroic! Also syncing up playtime tracking for GOG games is nice touch too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10321672041690281476gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10321672041690281476gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, more streaming services should now work when added into Heroic as they've added support for DRM in browser apps. Although, it's <em>limited</em> on Linux, since we only get a certain level of stuff like Widevine which the Heroic team don't control.</p>
<p>Here's all the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Games Support</li>
<li>GPTK support</li>
<li>DRM support for browser apps</li>
<li>ProtonDB &amp; Steam Deck compatibility on game page</li>
<li>Playtime tracking for GOG</li>
<li>Possibility to disable log files</li>
<li>Installing older DXVK on older hardware</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Epic Games accounts will no longer get logged out when launching Heroic sometimes</li>
<li>GOG games will now remember their install path correctly</li>
<li>GOG "Goodies" will now redirect users to their GOG account</li>
<li>Checking "Download games without HTTPS" in the advanced settings works again</li>
<li>Popover ("Help") menus in the settings now correctly open</li>
<li>"Report a problem running this game" instructions were updated</li>
<li>Linux: Using the Steam Runtime inside Flatpak now works</li>
<li>macOS: Users will no longer get error messages when launching Epic Games Store games without having CrossOver installed</li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver 525.47.34 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released another update to their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta driver</a> series with 525.47.34 out now. So here's what's new and fixed.</p>
<p>Quite a small one this time just hooking up two new extensions, and a performance improvement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_host_image_copy.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_host_image_copy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute.html" target="_blank">VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Improve performance of vkCmdBeginRendering/vkCmdEndRendering</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>This is their special developer-focused driver series. For those who need all the very latest Vulkan work. For gaming and normal users, you practically always want to just stick with their mainline drivers. Although, at times, these Vulkan Beta drivers do get extensions needed first for newer Proton / DXVK / VKD3D-Proton features. The latest mainline driver is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/nvidia-driver-535-86-05-out-now-linux/" target="_blank">535.86.05 from July 18th</a>.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular you're waiting on to be implemented in NVIDIA's drivers?</p>

      <title>Tencent to get a majority stake in Dying Light dev Techland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a bit of industry news for you. Techland, developer of Dying Light, have <a href="https://techland.net/news/techlands-next-chapter-and-the-road-ahead" target="_blank">announced</a> some "exciting news" about the future of their studio.</p>
<p>After the usual PR talk about wanting the best for the studio, Techland CEO Pawel Marchewka dropped word that Tencent are going to be acquiring a "majority shareholder". Marchewka went onto mention the deal will allow them to "move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games" and that they will retain full ownership of their IPs and maintain creative freedom.</p>
<p>Because we all enjoy game industry consolidation right? What could possibly go wrong with all these big groups swallowing up publishers and developers? There's Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/microsoft-wins-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank">grabbing Activision Blizzard</a>, Embracer eating up everything they can and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">then closing a bunch</a> and of course Tencent back again with more.</p>
<p>Tencent have invested into (and in some cases fully own) the likes of Riot Games, Epic Games, Turtle Rock Studios, Funcom, Bloober Team, Don't Nod, FromSoftware and plenty more.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Xenonauts 2 is looking good on desktop Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The invasion continues. Xenonauts 2 is now in Early Access from Goldhawk Interactive and Hooded Horse and I've taken a look to see how it runs on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>With the good news to begin - it works out of the box on both with Proton 8. No special Linux / Proton issues I've noticed when playing it. So if you're into XCOM-like strategy games, and this is very XCOM, then you're in for quite a treat, keeping in mind there will be bugs and balancing issues since it's an Early Access game.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck specifically, playing it is a little more difficult since it does not have full controller support. So you'll be using Steam Input's keyboard / mouse layout and it may take a few minutes to tweak it to your liking. Not a big issue though, and felt good enough with the Steam Deck's trackpads but actual controller support would make it just so much better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7776788271690218101gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7776788271690218101gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16987035071690218102gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16987035071690218102gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Pictured - Xenonauts 2 on Steam Deck. Click them to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>As for graphics settings on Steam Deck, I would suggest just sticking to the "Fast" preset with a 40Hz / FPS lock in the Steam Deck performance menu and you're pretty golden there. Not much is needed apart from that because it runs really nicely with those together overall. It's also turn-based so any drops I saw were momentary and not a problem for the gameplay.</p>
<p>Text size is once <em>again</em> an issue though. It’s not exactly heavy on the text, but there are times you get a few paragraphs to read based on mission reports and what’s going on. On Steam Deck the text size simply isn’t big enough to be comfortable to read. So it really needs the developer to adjust it and add in some actual scaling options.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux with my Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti it's no surprise that it handles max settings without breaking a sweat. No performance issues there at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1279342951690212435gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1279342951690212435gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Xenonauts 2 on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>So what's actually different compared with the original? The developer has been <a href="https://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/index.php?/topic/34952-what-are-the-differences-between-xenonauts-1-and-xenonauts-2/" target="_blank">keeping a list</a> and there's actually quite a lot. This includes more difficulty options, a proper tutorial, extensive tooltips, translation support, a better user interface with improved text clarity, Steam Achievements, better support for ultrawide displays, it's now using a modern 3D game engine (Unity), a number a new mission types and the list goes on.</p>
<p>For those who haven't played the first one, it's a lot more like the classic X-COM: UFO Defense / UFO: Enemy Unknown compared with the modern XCOM remakes. Think of it like an evolution of the 90s original, one that's quite a lot more tactical and a thorough challenge. You build various bases across the globe, and equip each one with buildings, troops and more to deal with an expanding alien threat. You need multiple bases too, as each has a limited area they can scan around them for UFOs.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="putzWEnR7J0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/31e246cd43822932a2944d19ebbf3ccb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/putzWEnR7J0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Bringing back some great memories of when I played X-COM: UFO Defense / UFO: Enemy Unknown on the Amiga. The excitement of discovery and the panic of a UFO being spotted that you need to chase down. There's a lot of interesting mechanics at play here with lots of enemy types, human agents working alongside them and all the mystery surrounding it keeps it feeling fun as you go through. Really it feels <em>exactly</em> like what I would want from a modern strategy game inspired by one of the best retro strategy games ever made (I'll fight anyone who thinks X-COM isn't an all-time great).</p>
<p><em>It does feel a little bit special playing a game inspired by a childhood favourite right in my hands on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Some of it really can be difficult, although a lot of it really does depend on your own decisions. In my first mission for example, I lost half my squad pretty quickly due to poor positioning. A small element of it is also the accuracy system, which as any XCOM player would know a "99%" hit chance right in their face can still result in you missing a shot and losing a soldier. There's missions where enemies will repeatedly get reinforcements too, making your positioning and timing all that more important.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10727932921690218148gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10727932921690218148gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Xenonauts 2 on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>The UI work done in it actually reminds me a <em>little</em> of the more modern Paradox games like Crusader Kings III, with nested pop-ups, links in text to hover that can bring up more information and other little adjustments. It's looking pretty good and thankfully laid out quite nicely so there's not a chance of getting lost in the UI.</p>
<p>So far I've been really impressed with it and look forward to seeing what development during Early Access brings. The developer has been actively fixing up issues as they come on, and responding to some comments about the (at times) punishing difficulty in some mission types with more difficulty options planned to be added in.</p>
<p>A little rough around the edges as expected but once complete, I can easily see this being one of the best strategy games to pick up and play. They're estimating around 9 months until the game leaves Early Access.</p>

      <title>Airships: Conquer the Skies gets a DLC adding in captains and governors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you played Airships: Conquer the Skies? It's a game about building fearsome airships and land vehicles to give you the edge in massive aerial battles.</p>
<p>It's a great game with full Native Linux support and it just got a big DLC with Airships: Heroes and Villains. This new DLC expands the game with captains that improve ship performance and give you abilities to turn the tide of battle. While it also adds in governors you can assign to cities to help reduce unrest and increase productivity. </p>
<p>As the developer explains: "Captains and governors react to events and your actions. A peace-loving governor may quit if he sees you commit one too many war crimes, whereas a researcher can gain experience from dissecting the monsters you kill. As time goes on they can change - for better or worse - and a few of them can become famous enough to re-unite the warring city-states, providing a new path to victory." </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WNErufrgWsk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49d8d705b271a0853897a6f1f31c3579.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WNErufrgWsk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall the game has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam and it's also Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>You can buy the game from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/airships-conquer-the-skies?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/airships_conquer_the_skies" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://zarkonnen.itch.io/airships" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/342560/Airships_Conquer_the_Skies/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Morrowind engine replacement OpenMW v0.48 out now with shaders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing with it some pretty fancy new features, the Morrowind engine replacement OpenMW version 0.48.0 is out now. An exciting release for bringing some modern stuff to this RPG classic.</p>
<p>One of the biggest additions is support for post-processing shaders giving plenty of new eye-candy and various advanced visual effects like bloom, godrays, ambient occlusion, and many more. There's also a new menu on F2, letting you toggle effects easily.</p>
<p>There's also much better looking fog, a visual overhaul of rain ripples, soft particles were implemented, a bunch of improved animations for blocking and spellcasting, big improvements to the sound-system so sounds fade instead of cutting out when moving away, various UI improvements, a data directory section in the launcher for easier modding, font settings in the launcher and lots of other tweaks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/210920021690194259gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/210920021690194259gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMW on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>Another major addition is the introduction of their own Lua scripting API named OpenMW-Lua. This was built with eventually supporting multiplayer and reaching parity with MWSE (Morrowind Script Extender) but will not work with normal MWSE-Lua mods because OpenMW is quite different behind the scenes. Future releases of it will continue to expand what it can do, so eventually OpenMW really will be <em>the</em> place for everything Morrowind.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://openmw.org/2023/openmw-0-48-0-released/" target="_blank">full release blog post</a> for more.</p>
<p>Want to set it up on Steam Deck? It's pretty easy as I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">covered in a previous guide</a>.</p>
