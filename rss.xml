      <title>GPU Reshape is a fancy new open source tool for developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh announcement for developers today is GPU Reshape, a free and open source tool that could be really useful for game developers working with Vulkan and DirectX 12 to deal with potentially undefined behaviour. </p>
<p>According to the post it's a collaboration between AMD and Avalanche Studios Group, which then continued externally with Miguel Petersen of Striking Distance Studios (prev at Avalanche) who is the author of GPU Reshape with help from various other developers. Great to see AMD and more game developers value open source.</p>
<p>What is it actually for? If you're not a game developer, it's probably complicated to understand. It's not my expertise either, but I love seeing game developer toolkits like this release as open source. Petersen even clearly states in the post that Linux support is <em>planned</em> for it! For more games to support Linux / Steam Deck well — developers need the tools too. As per the blog post Petersen explained it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A toolset that leverages on-the-fly instrumentation of GPU operations with instruction-level validation of potentially undefined behavior, supporting both DX12 and Vulkan. A standalone desktop application with no integration required, all open source (MIT), is now available in Beta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17463430641705595383gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17463430641705595383gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - GPU Reshape, credit to Miguel Petersen</em></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPU Reshape brings powerful features typical of CPU tooling to the GPU, providing validation of dynamic behaviour, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Bounds</strong> Validation of resource read / write coordinates against its bounds.</li>
<li><strong>Export Stability</strong> Numeric stability validation of floating point exports (UAV writes, render targets, vertex exports), e.g. NaN / Inf.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptor Validation</strong> Validation of descriptors, potentially dynamically indexed. This includes undefined, mismatched (compile-time to runtime), out of bounds descriptor indexing, and missing table bindings.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency Validation</strong> Validation of resource concurrency, i.e. single-producer or multiple-consumer, between queues and events.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Initialization</strong> Validation of resource initialization, ensures any read was preceded by a write. (*1)</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Loops</strong> Detection of infinite loops. <em>Experimental</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a number of other planned additions, as they hope to see it evolve into a general purpose tool including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shader debugging, providing the ability to inspect live data as the shader sees it.</li>
<li>Shader assertions, in source assertions typical of CPU code.</li>
<li>Branch hot spots, live hot spot profiling of all branches.</li>
<li>Branch coherence, live coherence analysis of all branches.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep survival game Vintage Story adds cave-ins, improved first-person, lots more animals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a brutal deep survival game that I just love to watch expand, because it's so filled full of content it's spilling over the sides. The latest release, v1.19.0 Dejank Redux brings in even more content.</p>
<p>When it comes to content additions there's 11 new species of deer, 11 types of goats, you can now catch animals with a basket, antlers and horns you can mount on walls, a rework of ruins, new accessibility settings, snowballs, more character customization options, tule and sedge plants, an overhauled first-person mode, a cave-in system when digging and so much more.</p>
<p>This game is really quite something, and pretty darn challenging too.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is releasing from Aspyr and Crystal Dynamics on February 14th, and now Valve have given it the green tick of approval as it is now Steam Deck Verified. It was tested on the latest stable Proton 8 release, so as long as you use that across Steam Deck / Desktop Linux you should be good to go.</p>
<p>With this bundle you'll get Tomb Raider I + Unfinished Business, Tomb Raider II + Golden Mask and Tomb Raider III + The Lost Artifact. Aspyr say it has upgraded graphics, with the option to switch to the original polygon look at any time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="68hISohBKmI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b5ec2a583843ecf225dac38e2674861b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/68hISohBKmI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can pre-order via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_i_to_iii_remastered" target="_blank">GOG</a> (you can use Lutris / Heroic)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tomb-raider-iiii-remastered?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2478970/Tomb_Raider_IIII_Remastered_Starring_Lara_Croft/" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>Will you be picking it up to have a nostalgia blast? Worth pointing out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/open-source-re-implementation-of-tomb-raider-1-1996-tr1x-gets-a-big-bug-fix-release/" target="_blank">open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) TR1X</a> also exists. Remasters can be a pretty great thing to bring new audiences to older games, although they don't always hit, so hopefully Aspyr were careful with the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection.</p>

      <title>Exiled is a new compact puzzle thriller from the director of My Friendly Neighborhood</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for being puzzled and thrilled at the same time in a compact setting? John Szymanski, director of My Friendly Neighborhood, has released a standalone version of Exiled.</p>
<p>The developer said to expect an experience sort-of like Myst and The Room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note has been left on her desk talking of "the ancient evil" and "banishment to a different realm." The eldritch tome and an untranslated scrap she had been studying act as the only clues to her disappearance. Use clues found in the book to translate an ancient language, evade the lurking horrors, and solve the mystery of the strange objects around you!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UNBYgBHS_e0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82925969cbd0892222bffa3fea01d923.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UNBYgBHS_e0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The original was part of Dread X Collection 2 but now you can buy it standalone, and with Native Linux support too. It's had a few upgrades since then for this version including new voice acting, a re-written narrative, updated visuals, better scares and so on. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2741620/discussions/0/4139437492717265200/#c4139437492723453667" target="_blank">According to the dev</a> it's "significantly more engaging for a new player".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve ancient puzzles, decode an eldritch language, and avoid the lurking horror all while sitting at a single desk.</li>
<li>Tense and foreboding atmosphere where the stillness of the library can be shattered at any moment.</li>
<li>High level of interactivity.</li>
<li>Multiple endings.</li>
<li>Good for a single play session.</li>
<li>Voiceover by Tom Schalk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741620/Exiled/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Popular mobile puzzle game classic Threes! is launching on PC for its 10th anniversary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Threes! took the mobile world by storm back in 2014 winning the Apple Design Award, and finally for its 10th anniversary it will be coming to Steam so we can all get in on the fun. Releasing on February 6th, it appears it will have Native Linux support too!</p>
<p>It's been through a few upgrades it seems for the Steam version too with controller support and Steam Cloud support too. Might be a good one to chill out with in your coffee breaks at your desk, or on your Steam Deck too (if mobile is not your thing…). A puzzle game that just keeps on going and going until you get tired of it, ready to pick up again another day.</p>
<p>Original trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rgpJUj7GUFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc70115a16cb419fa8a9d7ba39980d84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rgpJUj7GUFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page is light on details, because not much is needed. You slide around numbers to make more numbers. Brilliant in its simplicity.</p>
<p>Much like the more recent hit Wordle, Threes! ended up with a huge amount of games just entirely copying the idea. One that went viral was 2048 (<a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048" target="_blank">open source</a>) although technically a clone of another similar game (it gets complicated), which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22914955/threes-2048-ketchapp-copycats-clones-mobile-games" target="_blank">The Verge</a> wrote a bit of a round-up about back in 2022. This happens a <em>lot</em> on mobile though, as game-farms see an idea and copy it as quickly as they can. Somewhat reminds me of how Vampire Survivors made a few mechanics popular, and now it has a growing amount of similar games.</p>
<p>Have a look and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818570/Threes/" target="_blank">wishlist Threes! on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Time Survivors is the most completely absurd Vampire Survivors-like yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time Survivors just released on Steam and like many horde survival games it takes the idea of Vampire Survivors, and puts a few little different ideas into the mix and it's probably the most insane one yet. My time has been testing it with Proton 8 where it works great on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Lunar Chili, the developer, say it is the "most historically inaccurate roguelike ever made", although they're stretching the term roguelike there. Apart from some odd wording (probably translation issues) and some balancing needing to be done, it's actually a whole lot of fun — and really quite challenging, more so than most in the VS knock-off genre. I say knock-off lovingly, because I do enjoy all these games very much, but VS clearly started a whole specific thing here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10506505891705577572gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10506505891705577572gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The characters of course are completely ridiculous, as are some of their abilities. The enemies make absolutely <em>no</em> sense either. You'll be coming up against flying skulls, giant multi-headed fire-breathing dogs, dinosaurs, big flying golden gargoyles, massive flesh-eating plants and it seems <em>whatever</em> the hell they felt like putting in the game. Don't go into this one expecting anything to make sense, and that's what I love about this one. It's so ridiculous and stupid with the setting it just works, it's fun and that's the important thing.</p>
<p>Not many games you can say you played as Abraham Lincoln fighting off zombies and rats while throwing around a Yo-yo and a Flail. Oh and your special ability as Abe is to throw down some Cherry Blossom trees to block enemies, because yeah - that makes sense? Everything in the game is like that just pure absurdity.</p>
<p>Upgrades for days too, with quite an interesting system. You can upgrade each character, each weapon...and so on. And certain types of upgrades need different resources, so you'll be on the hunt on each map for more than just gold.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18257844401705579642gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18257844401705579642gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You even have map-based mini-events to do as well, like a Time Circle where you have to stay inside a blue zone while a big clock hand moves around it. However, invincible Time Guardians that look suspiciously like butterflies are flying around trying to hit you while you're in the zone. On top of that there's special challenges that you get by finding relics, that will give you a boost if you manage to purge their effects like killing 200 creatures, but each creature death shoots out a bunch of deadly petals. Or survive for 60 seconds while giant snakes made of skulls filling up the screen come after you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1855596851705578623gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1855596851705578623gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Total madness.</em></p>
<p>At one point I turned into a giant. Giant Abe! Stomping all over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7943437171705578479gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7943437171705578479gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as epic historic characters, each with their unique ability.</li>
<li>Historically inaccurate stages such as the Stone Age, the Dark Age, Ancient Egypt, and more full of enemies, secrets, mini bosses and end-stage boss.</li>
<li>Skill-tree based meta progression for all elements in the game.</li>
<li>Hundreds of different weapons, buffs, Cursed Relics, Powerups, and unlockables to choose from for a unique experience every run.</li>
<li>Casual quick 20 minute play sessions + plenty of quests and secrets to discover.</li>
<li>A Sandbox mode to test any overpowered build and train against any enemy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you love these survivor-like horde survival games, it seems Time Survivors is one you need to try.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux everything worked as expected, but for Steam Deck (and gamepads) the experienced needs to be improved. The developers say they test it themselves, and on their Steam forum they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2211390/discussions/0/3766732914510239086/" target="_blank">claim</a> "Yes, Time Survivors is compatible with Steam Deck." but it only has <em>partial</em> controller support with some parts like the unlock screen not working with gamepad at all. I had to switch Steam Input to keyboard+mouse for it to work well on Steam Deck and be playable. Which is fine, as the controls are incredibly simple. Apart from that though, on Steam Deck (OLED), the only time I saw performance drop was taking down a big enemy where <em>lots</em> of gold spawned, while there were <em>tons</em> of other enemies but that came back up quickly.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2211390/Time_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 535.154.05 for Linux brings a few bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: it turns out, once again, NVIDIA released a new driver and copy-pasted the changelog from a previous version. This is <em>at least</em> the third time they've done this now. The changelog below is actually from the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/216728/en-uk/" target="_blank">535.146.02</a> driver, that was released in December. I've contacted NVIDIA to find out what's actually in the 535.154.05 driver. The only actual change that can be seen right now is this new driver notes it supports the new GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER in the Supported Products section, but the actual changelog <em>hasn't</em> changed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>NVIDIA released driver version 535.154.05 for Linux on January 16th bringing with it a few useful sounding bug fixes, so here's what's new for the first NVIDIA update of 2024. Quite a small one to start the year!</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/217862/en-uk" target="_blank">release page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an application is run with __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via Wine.</li>
<li>Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a mix of physical and virtual displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend, which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when running on Wayland with newer versions of libwayland-client.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This release is from their "Production Branch", so anyone should be good to go on upgrading to it as it's a normal stable driver release.</p>
<p>Is there an NVIDIA driver bug that you're currently waiting on being solved? Does this driver cause issues for you? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Valve seeing increasing bug reports due to Steam Snap - other methods recommended</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced some time ago their Steam Snap which was promoted as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/ubuntu-2304-is-out-now-with-gnome-44-and-a-stable-steam-snap/" target="_blank">stable with Ubuntu 23.04</a>, as they continue to push their own packaging format with Snap but it seems this has been causing problems for Valve.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, developer Timothee "TTimo" Besset, who works on various things for Valve <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TTimo/111772575146054328" target="_blank">posted</a> asking people to consider using the official Valve .deb package or at least consider using the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.valvesoftware.Steam" target="_blank">Flatpak</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve is seeing an increasing number of bug reports for issues caused by Canonical's repackaging of the Steam client through snap.</p>
<p>The best way to install Steam on Debian and derivative operating systems is to follow the instructions at <a href="http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/" target="_blank" title="http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/">http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/</a> and use the official .deb</p>
<p>We are not involved with the snap repackaging. It has a lot of issues.</p>
<p>If you don't want the .deb, please at least consider the flatpak version.</p>
<cite>Timothee "TTimo" Besset</cite></blockquote>
<p>So if you've been having various problems with Steam on Ubuntu (or a derivative like Kubuntu), it may be because you've installed it as a Snap. Worth trying out the official .deb or Flatpak to see if it runs better for you. You can also give Canonical feedback in your issues on their <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/tag/gaming" target="_blank">Discourse Forum</a> and report issues to Valve on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (if you're using their official packages).</p>
<p><em>Hopefully Canonical can look into any issues.</em></p>

      <title>Against the Storm 1.1 (and later hotfixes) bring various Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Against the Storm is a dark fantasy city builder where you must rebuild civilization in the face of apocalyptic rains, and the recent 1.0 release came with it being Steam Deck Verified but the developer hasn't stopped making improvements for Steam Deck in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/5797888151160865057" target="_blank">version 1.1</a> out now.</p>
<p>While version 1.1 did bring some new content like unique portraits for all traders, new decorations, new orders, new sound effects, notifications with auto-pause, UI improvements and more it's nice to see them also focus on Steam Deck too. For the v1.1 update the Steam Deck changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed the way the trackpad works in the Steam Deck version of the game when using the controller layout. Instead of acting like an analog stick, it now behaves like a real mouse trackpad.</li>
<li>When starting fresh on the Steam Deck, the game will now automatically load the medium graphics preset and have uncapped FPS by default for a smoother experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they've also subsequently released a couple of hotfixes with more changes including in v1.1.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Enter key not committing changes on the Steam Deck's virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>We temporarily reversed the recent changes to the default Steam Deck controller layout to avoid the cursor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here they also noted they were aware of an issue "that prevents Steam Deck players from starting a new settlement from the World Map" that they were looking into. Following that, version 1.1.4 was released and further noted these Steam Deck improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Right Trigger would stop working when using the trackpad (when playing with the official controller layout).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the controller pointer would disappear in the embarkation panel and citadel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see the developer, Eremite Games, really pay attention to their Steam Deck support and fix issues as they get found. It's one thing to get Steam Deck Verification from Valve's own testing, it's another to directly support it like this.</p>
<p>Against the Storm is Steam Deck Verified and has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB. It also has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and has proven to be very popular.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for other stores on Steam Deck adds automatic game shortcuts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is an application <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">I showed off a while ago</a>, that gives you a helping hand in installing other game stores and launchers on Steam Deck. The latest update, version 3.2, adds in some really useful helpful features.</p>
<p>There's a lot of stores and streaming services supported including Amazon Games, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar, Ubisoft, Minecraft and more.</p>
<p>In the latest update they added a feature to the app the automatically scans and adds your games installed via Epic Games and Ubisoft Connect, with more services planned to be supported on that soon. All you need to do is install a game via one of them, and then you can restart Steam to have them be picked up. They also added in proper artwork for launchers, games and supported streaming services so it all looks neat and tidy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12094501301705502113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12094501301705502113gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also said it should hopefully now support multiple Steam accounts, they fixed up the SD Card path for the SteamOS 3.5 update, plus various other small fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Overall it sounds like a great update.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS big 1.5.0 update out with new mode - continues working on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-finals-now-appears-to-work-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">I recently reported on THE FINALS</a> now working on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, and it seems even with the latest major update just released with version 1.5.0 bringing a new game mode it continues working.</p>
<p>With it using Easy Anti-Cheat, it's still quite a surprise to see it actually working. Especially since there's been no official word from the developer, and they have not replied to my previous email about it. Easy Anti-Cheat does support Linux both Native Linux and Windows games in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but developers need to enable it manually — so it seems they have. But it's still odd not to see any official word on it around 5 days later.</p>
<p>Screenshots of it on Kubuntu 23.10 with MangoHud, click shots to enlarge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3237735761705499959gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3237735761705499959gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13597075261705499960gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13597075261705499960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, just ensure you've set it to Proton Experimental in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu in your Steam Library to have it work. There's some issues though like with voice chat (turn it off) and certain graphical options that may cause crashes - but for me it's been smooth sailing.</p>
<p>One issue that has come up is if your CPU support AVX512, you will need to add "clearcpuid=304" to your GRUB boot menu (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/194yurj/comment/khkscq3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Version 1.5.0 brings with it a new limited-time solo mode "Solo Bank It":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are introducing our very first limited-time mode (LTM): Solo Bank It!<br/>
This experimental twist on Bank It pits contestants against each other in a fight for individual glory in a 12-player arena. Just like Bank It, the first to amass 40,000 and deposit in the cash-out station wins. Solo queuers, rejoice!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty of other fixes and improvements you can see in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/3963797741108613372" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Latest update video is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="etpFbuVapb0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6edc56a5be5caf20ce77956a872bc758.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/etpFbuVapb0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great to see such a popular game like this working so well now!</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck &#39;chiaki4deck&#39; can now put the system to sleep</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently the open source PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck, chiaki4deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/open-source-playstation-remote-play-app-for-steam-deck-chiaki4deck-gets-a-big-upgrade/" target="_blank">got a big update</a> but it came with a few issues that needed solving and a new v1.6.1 is out now. Plus a fun new feature was added.</p>
<p>This is a great app for those of you who have either a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 and a Steam Deck, especially when you want to continue gaming but someone else wants the TV it's connected to. This is actually a fork of the original Chiaki, with enhancements to make it work better directly on the Steam Deck along with better documentation.</p>
<p>New features and fixes in v1.6.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes console registration.</li>
<li>Fixes fullscreen double-click and F11 shortcuts.</li>
<li>Don't close main window when closing stream session on MacOS.</li>
<li>Adds option to sleep PlayStation when sleeping Steam Deck.</li>

      <title>Ubisoft think gamers need to get comfortable with not owning games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a> recently spoke to Ubisoft, and something said during the interview seems to have created some sparks across the industry about game ownership.</p>
<p>What was said is not all that surprising really. Ubisoft, like multiple others, run subscription services with theirs being Ubisoft+ that just had a bit of a change into multiple tiers. These services are everywhere now like Xbox Game Pass, EA Play and others. That, and GI.biz spoke to Philippe Tremblay, director of subscriptions at Ubisoft so obviously they're going to be somewhat biased on what they think — it's their job.</p>
<p>From the interview, the bit in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. As gamers grow comfortable in that aspect… you don't lose your progress. If you resume your game at another time, your progress file is still there. That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The GOG team certainly took notice, <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1747335663995818251" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on X (formerly Twitter): "You should feel extremely comfortable with owning your games on GOG (they're DRM-free) :)".</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that clearly it's going well for Ubisoft, as Tremblay mentioned October 2023 was their biggest month in Ubisoft+ history. So people are clearly buying into game subscriptions more and more. And related, Microsoft said back in 2022 that Xbox Game Pass had 25 million subscribers. Subscriptions are clearly here to stay.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, to be clear, Ubisoft don't plan to force you into one way or another noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The point is not to force users to go down one route or another," he explains. "We offer purchase, we offer subscription, and it's the gamer's preference that is important here. We are seeing some people who buy choosing to subscribe now, but it all works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given how services can just entirely remove your paid-for content, this whole issue of ownership is a concerning one. Like how Sony were going to just remove previously purchased Discovery content from users, although they've since <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/" target="_blank">backtracked</a> on that after public outcry.</p>
<p>The thing is, you have to remember, you don't actually own your games on Steam either. This has been well-known for a long time now. As per Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" target="_blank">Subscriber Agreement</a> under the "A. General Content and Services License" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services. To make use of the Content and Services, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll admit, it's not <em>entirely</em> the same. Valve won't take away your games if you don't pay them every month, it's not a subscription in the same way, and plenty of games on Steam are actually <em>entirely</em> DRM-free and can be run outside of Steam. But still, it's something to remember, ownership has been on the decline for a long time.</p>
<p>A lot of it simply comes down to convenience though right? Plenty of us pay for Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and so on and so on — so we can just quickly jump into a show or a movie they have available. But then the problem there is, again, everyone wants their own service. There's more popping up all the time, and rights on various shows end up split between them and you end up paying more and more (look at <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/animation/where-to-watch-pokemon-episodes-movies" target="_blank">the mess</a> of Pokémon streaming) and never owning a damn thing.</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments: what are your thoughts? </p>

      <title>Wine 9.0 brings much improved Windows app and game compatibility to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here! The official release of Wine 9.0 has now been made available, bringing the next-generation of Windows compatibility to Linux for apps and games. This is the tech that forms a major part of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This release has been a year in the making, with a new stable Wine release done once a year with many development releases in between bringing over 7,000 individual changes. There's some truly big stuff in this release too and some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An experimental Wayland graphics driver, not enabled by default yet.</li>
<li>Lots of WoW64 work including the completion of converting modules to PE format to "introduce a proper boundary between the Windows and Unix worlds". They say it's now possible to run 32-bit Windows applications on a purely 64-bit Unix installation but this new WoW64 mode is not yet enabled by default.</li>
<li>The completion of the PE/Unix separation means that it's possible to run existing Windows binaries on ARM64.</li>
<li>The Vulkan driver supports up to version 1.3.272 of the Vulkan spec.</li>
<li>Various optimizations have been made to core WineD3D and the Vulkan backend.</li>
<li>A number of GdiPlus functions are optimized for better graphics performance.</li>
<li>The Windows Media Video (WMV) decoder DirectX Media Object (DMO) is implemented.</li>
<li>DirectInput action maps are implemented, improving compatibility with many old games that use this to map controller inputs to in-game actions.</li>
<li>URL/URI protocol associations are exported as URL handlers to the Linux desktop.</li>
<li>Lots of Internationalization improvements including updates for Unicode and better support for native Windows IME implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on for a while, that's just some cherry-picked big additions.</p>
<p>As a result of all the changes many more applications and games designed for Windows will now run on Linux (and other platforms where Wine can run).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" target="_blank">full release notes</a> for all the changes.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect 2 announced from Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As soon as I saw a Prison Architect teaser recently, I knew this was about to come! Prison Architect 2 has now been formally announced from Paradox Interactive with Double Eleven on developer duty.</p>
<p>This was expected anyway, since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/01/paradox-interactive-have-purchased-the-rights-to-prison-architect-from-introversion/" target="_blank">Paradox purchased the rights to Prison Architect</a> back in early 2019, and then in March 2023 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/prison-architect-has-a-final-free-update-out-now/" target="_blank">the original had its final upgrade</a>. So of course Paradox weren't going to sit on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LiymA3jw0fQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5dc737c78cfd0d25e41c759b22357956.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LiymA3jw0fQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The World’s Greatest Prison Simulation Game - Now in 3D! </strong>Use your resources to build, manage, and control your prison in classic Prison Architect playstyle—now in 3 glorious dimensions! Design every corner of your prison and manage everything from daily schedules to policies, and ensure your prison is safe, self-sustaining, and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Build the Ultimate Penitentiary: </strong>Establish all of your prison infrastructure over multiple floors, and use tons of snazzy new tools that allow you to build a state-of-the-art correctional facility. The design of your prison will affect every aspect of your inmates’ lives, so make your schemes accordingly!</li>
<li><strong>The Smartest Inmates Ever: </strong>Unique inmates have schemes of their own – they now form distinct relationships that influence behavior, make decisions based on wants and needs, and plot their paths better than ever. Watch as they interact and attempt to navigate the daily trials of your prison. Remember that every choice you make might either help or hinder your inmates' correctional journey. What type of relationships will your inmates have with your prison?</li>
<li><strong>The Prison Magnate: </strong>Establish and run a true institution from the top, building up unique correctional facilities in a freshly upgraded Career Mode that will take you across a brand new world map. Will your prisons end up being monuments to rehabilitation or retribution? Most importantly, will they pay the bills?</li>
<li><strong>Every Action has a Reaction: </strong>Choices matter and yours will determine the fate of your prison. More control than ever—over inmates, prison policies, architecture and more—means more ways for things to go well… or not! Plan carefully or you may have to cope with escapes, gang wars, and all sorts of expensive and destructive problems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “In Prison Architect 2, our team set out to create the next level in management gameplay. A greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation come together to provide an enhanced presentation of prison management, in a 3D world. Much loved features make a return to help you manage your inmates, quell riots, prevent escapes and share your prisons, but now cross-platform! In addition to a new upgrade system, a new Career Mode, and more.” said Gareth Wright, Game Director at Double Eleven. “We look forward to seeing how players get creative with multiple floors and catwalks to finally construct and expand in 3D. And then optimize and balance their prison’s safety, security and self-betterment.”</p>
<p>Currently, it seems much like Cities: Skylines 2 that Paradox also publishes, that the Native Linux and macOS support has been dropped. I've reached out to Paradox PR to clarify. Hopefully (and quite likely) it will run with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, and if not, no doubt future Proton updates could get it running like we've seen with the tens of thousands of games that run on desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's due out on March 26th.</p>
<p>You can follow / pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl releases September 5th, 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World announced that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has moved from its Q1 2024 release plan, to have a final release date of September 5th, 2024. While we don't know yet how it will run on Steam Deck or desktop Linux with Proton, it's likely to be one of the most popular releases on PC this year so it's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>Speaking about the delay, GSC said "While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim, we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing". Continuing they mentioned showing it off at Gamescom 2023 to a small set of people, but it showed the game needed more time in the oven for technical issues to be solved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6o6D_a3PAHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d7468dd999d2555e011eebbbf571c9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6o6D_a3PAHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can also see their previous trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XNGbS0fY80s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/04af652b1c31e25e03abed950ef42f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XNGbS0fY80s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is available for pre-order via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" target="_blank">GOG</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank">Steam</a> </p>
<p>So if you've not played the originals, you've now got a bit of extra time to jump into them and they all work on Linux desktop with Proton. Some work okay on Steam Deck too. Although, for Call of Pripyat, you may get a better experience with OpenXRay.</p>
<p>It's worth noting also that recently the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/stalker-game-engine-openxray-gets-taken-down-on-github/" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay got taken down on GitHub</a>, but it was later reinstated since the DMCA was fraudulent and GSC actually gave it their blessing. Nice to see another company look after their players and understand projects like that are actually good for their older games.</p>
<p><em>Will this be something you'll be checking out at release? Let me know in the comments. </em></p>

      <title>winesapOS, the portable SteamOS-like Linux distro gets improved hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have a system you wish to try out Linux on for gaming be it an Apple Mac, a PC with Windows or anything else - perhaps give winesapOS a little try as you might find this SteamOS-like distribution to your liking. It offers up a portable solution with persistent storage, so you can load it up on a USB drive and take it anywhere</p>
<p>The main developer, Luke Short, emailed in about some major changes and improvements that have arrived with winesapOS version 3.4.0.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17417539781705414006gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17417539781705414006gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - The KDE Plasma Desktop Mode in winesapOS, just like SteamOS</em></p>
<p>Highlights of some improvements in v3.4.0 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Mode (Gamescope session - Steam Big Picture) support for Steam and Open Gamepad UI.</li>
<li>Improved hardware support:
<ul>
<li>Lots of new hardware support: Intel Arc dGPUs, Lenovo Legion Go, GPD Win 4, iPhone tethering, racing wheels, Razer accessories, and improved support for older AMD dGPUs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downloading the operating system has been simplified:
<ul>
<li>Instead of extracting 3 to 7 parts of a split-up zip file (due to GitHub Release hosting constraints), we now provide a single zip file for each image type. This has been the biggest complaint that they finally addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Recovery console to help you fix boot problems.</li>
<li>+ much more in the <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS/releases/tag/3.4.0" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</li>

      <title>Framework email customers for data breach from accounting partner getting phished</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No one is safe from data breaches, and at times it won't even be the company you've directly interacted and purchased from but their partners, like what recently happened to Framework. <em>Framework are the company that make the modular Framework laptop, which is really cool!</em></p>
<p>From what I can tell, Framework have not announced this in public but sent it in an email to affected customers which one decided to copy and paste on to the Framework Forum <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-data-breach/43408" target="_blank">in a post</a>.</p>
<p>The email notes how their accounting partner, Keating Consulting, had a staff member fall victim to a "phishing email that utilized social engineering tactics to obtain customer PII (Personal Identifiable Information) associated with outstanding balances for Framework purchases" and anyone getting the email was affected by it. For those hit their full name, email address and balance owed would have been gained by the attackers.</p>
<p>Framework said about the list that it was "primarily of a subset of open pre-orders, but some completed past orders with pending accounting syncs were also included in this list".</p>
<p>One thing that has confused multiple people, is that even people who <em>don't</em> have an outstanding balance were emailed, which was cleared up in a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-data-breach/43408/5" target="_blank">later post</a> by a moderator forwarding information from the Framework team. There may not be a customer-facing balance, but their system may have a slight difference due to changes in taxes since an order.</p>
<p>It's just another reminder to be seriously careful on clicking links to ensure they really go to where they say, especially in emails, and not entering any information into a form you're not 100% sure on. It can happen to anyone. Always check the full URL.</p>

      <title>Check out these Steam Deck Verified highlights for January 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been quite chilly here in the UK, so I've been spending a lot more time sat under a blanket with my Steam Deck OLED. If you're looking for some more Steam Deck Verified games to pick up and keep warm with too, here's a January 2024 overview of some new entries.</p>
<p>All of the titles listed below have full <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified ratings from Valve that have been given the rating only recently.</p>

<p>Something else interesting for you: the Steam Deck has been in Steam's global Top 5 sellers (based on revenue) for the last 10 weeks in a row now. Of those 10 weeks it's spent 6 of them as number 1! While we don't know exact numbers, since Valve don't give any out, it's nice to see it continue to do so well.</p>
<p>What have you been playing recently on Steam Deck or Linux Desktop? What are your latest recommendations that people pick up and play?</p>

      <title>X.Org and Xwayland get new releases due to security issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's another reminder that checking regularly for updates is always a good thing, because there's new releases available for both the X.Org X and Xwayland due to multiple reported security issues.</p>
<p>First up, here's the actual listed issues reported and fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-6816 can be triggered by passing an invalid array index to DeviceFocusEvent or ProcXIQueryPointer.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0229 can be triggered if a device has both a button and a key class and zero buttons.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-21885 can be triggered if a device with a given ID was removed and a new device with the same ID added both in the same operation.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-21886 can be triggered by disabling a master device with disabled slave devices.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0409 can be triggered by enabling SELinux xserver_object_manager and running a client.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0408 can be triggered by enabling SELinux xserver_object_manager and creating a GLX PBuffer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This security advisory went public on the X.Org <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061525.html" target="_blank">mailing list</a> this morning.</p>
<p>The issues are present in X.Org X server prior to 21.1.11 and Xwayland prior to 23.2.4, both of which were just announced and released. The <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061526.html" target="_blank">xorg-server 21.1.11</a> release additionally "also contains a fix for XRandR to allow for multiple virtual monitors on a physical display" plus <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061527.html" target="_blank">xwayland 23.2.4</a> additionally "also contains several other fixes for glamor, libEI support, and FreeBSD".</p>

      <title>Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) TR1X gets a big bug-fix release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Offering a huge amount of improvements over the original game from UI improvements to modern adjustments of the gameplay mechanics to feel better, no doubt this is currently the best way to play through the original Tomb Raider.

      <title>Huge fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx latest massive update is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since mid-December, the latest big content update to the fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx is out now bringing some sweeping changes. Still in Early Access but it's getting closer to the big 1.0 release.</p>
<p>More about it: Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder where you start off as an insignificant colony and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a metropolis and empire. The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It's set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination.</p>
<p>The latest release, v65 "the way of water", features a big overhaul to the water system. This includes sweet and salty water that have different uses and a new water pumping system. Overall it sounds like there's a lot you can do with water in the game now like making canals, certain buildings use sweet water to function better and the water system just seems to have more depth to it now. Plus there's 4 new music tracks, an improve day/night cycle, new lock and unlock mechanics, new icons everywhere, lots of modding improvements, a new quarter-speed option was added, there's new damage and armour types, lots of UI reworks and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1162750/view/3905247944461887535" target="_blank">the list just goes on and on</a> as you'll see some of in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EKCzZpcLSvg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adaa7637a7861353d6afe557c70bc82f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EKCzZpcLSvg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My early time with the game showed that it had incredible potential, and I've seen that some players have put in 100s of hours into it. It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating for both Overall and Recent reviews on Steam, so clearly the developer has been knocking it out of the park with the regular massive updates. Seriously, the review numbers are impressive with only 93 negative versus 3,122 positive.</p>
<p>I just continue to be impressed at the sheer scope of it, the game is huge and has so much to do in it so I'm not surprised to see such huge game time from some players. If you've skipped over it or not heard of it before, time to put it on your radar for sure.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/songs_of_syx?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://songsofsyx.itch.io/songs-of-syx" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162750/Songs_of_Syx/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SMITE 2 announced with Steam Deck support from Titan Forge and Hi-Rez Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the latest Unreal Engine 5, Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently revealed their third-person action MOBA, SMITE 2 that will be coming with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>If you've not played before think perhaps more like Dota 2 but third-person and plays a bit more like an ARPG with the gameplay match progress of a MOBA. Which is where you take down towers and push through the map to take territory from the opposing team. SMITE 2 is a complete sequel built from the ground-up in Unreal Engine 5 to bring "everything players love about <em>SMITE</em> and wraps it in state of the art visuals, animations and gameplay".</p>
<p>They said to expect "a refined user interface, updated audio, clearer spell effects and fresh physics-based abilities for Gods such as Ymir, everything in the game has been improved" and that the "move to a new backend technology also brings state of the art cross-play, a ranked rework that contains new tiers and structures, alongside improved matchmaking".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o1PHxmPq5o4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0873efb61a76fb0f33cc783a1ceed637.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o1PHxmPq5o4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.smite2.com/faqs/" target="_blank">official FAQ</a> under the supported platforms they note "SMITE 2 is a next-gen native title, in development for PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and SteamDeck.". The note of Steam Deck support was also included in their official press release too.</p>
<p>Since they're testing on Steam Deck, no doubt it will work just fine on desktop Linux too with Proton.</p>

<p>Well this quite a surprise. THE FINALS is one of the most popular new online FPS games that uses Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services, and as of a recent update — it works on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>So far, I haven't seen anything official from the developer to confirm it was actually enabled intentionally, and I purposefully held off on this initially but it's been a few days and it's continued working. I tend to err on the side of caution, since we've seen other games with EAC previously work without knowing why and then break again shortly after. Hopefully THE FINALS will continue working, since it's so popular with it regularly seeing over 90,000 people (peak count) playing on Steam each day.</p>
<p>It can be a little <em>unstable</em> though, with some reporting Voice Chat and a few graphics options can cause crashes. However, now it actually works, testing can be done and so Valve can fix up issues in Proton, and developers on the various Linux graphics drivers as they get reported.</p>
<p>Some shots taken on Kubuntu 23.10, click pics to enlarge them:</p>

<p>If you make sure you set it to use Proton Experimental in the game properties on Steam, you should be good to go for now. There's lots of reports filling up on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2073850?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> now too from people playing it across Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With my own testing on Kubuntu 23.10 with an AMD Radeon 6800 XT on Mesa 23.3.3 on Epic settings pictured above with FSR set to Quality it has been running really smoothly overall.</p>
<p>Today I reached out to Embark Studios for a statement, so hopefully their team will be able to let us all know what's happening with it officially.</p>
<p>THE FINALS can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073850/THE_FINALS/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a> free to play.</p>

      <title>Lutris game manager v0.5.15 brings lots of overall improvements for game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lutris is a game manager and helpful game installer for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux that brings together your game library from Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, EA, Emulators and more. The latest release has improvements across the whole app to make it smoother.</p>
<p>The v0.5.15 release is not all about big headline features, but improvement the way most things inside it work. For instance, having it download components it needs while the app is open instead of displaying a basic "updating runtime" box makes the app starting and initial experience feel a whole lot cleaner and nicer overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17098571651705326236gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17098571651705326236gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all the main new stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Download runtime components from the main window, the "updating runtime" dialog appearing before Lutris opens has been removed.</li>
<li>Add the ability to open a location in your file browser from file picker widgets.</li>
<li>Add the ability to select, remove, or stop multiple games in the Lutris window.</li>
<li>Redesigned 'Uninstall Game' dialog now completely removes games by default.</li>
<li>Show an animation when a game is launched.</li>
<li>Add the ability to disable Wine auto-updates at the expense of losing support.</li>
<li>Add playtime editing in the game preferences.</li>
<li>Move game files, runners to the trash instead of deleting them they are uninstalled.</li>
<li>Add "Updates" tab in Preferences control and check for updates and correct missing media in the 'Games' view.</li>
<li>Add "Storage" tab in Preferences to control game and installer cache location.</li>
<li>Expand "System" tab in Preferences with more system information but less brown.</li>
<li>Add "Run Task Manager" command for Wine games.</li>
<li>Add two new, smaller banner sizes for itch.io games.</li>
<li>Sync Steam playtimes with the Lutris library.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug and crash fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix the export / import feature.</li>
<li>Fix some crashes happening when using Wayland and a high DPI gaming mouse.</li>
<li>Fix crash when opening the system preferences tab for a game.</li>
<li>Reduced the locales list to a predefined one (let us know if you need yours added).</li>
<li>Fix Lutris not expanding "~" in paths.</li>
<li>Ignore Wine virtual desktop setting when using Wine-GE/Proton to avoid crash.</li>
<li>Ignore MangoHUD setting when launching Steam to avoid crash.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Find out more on the <a href="https://lutris.net" target="_blank">official site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. </p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: a quick bug-fix release was put up shortly after with <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.16" target="_blank">v0.5.16</a> having these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug that prevented installers to complete.</li>
<li>Better handling of Steam configurations for the Steam account picker.</li>
<li>Load game library in a background thread.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Noxious Weeds takes Vampire Survivors and adds in angry veggies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love horde-slaying reverse bullet-hell survival games like Vampire Survivors? Noxious Weeds is another that's now available in Early Access and it comes with Native Linux support. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent a key to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">GOL Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HRrKqeqImo0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe090bba7cf070601d766a18757ddcd3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HRrKqeqImo0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Basically, this is VS with very angry plants as enemies along with a day and night cycle, and during the day you get to rescue cute little veggies to help out. Nice and inviting, colourful and has a sweet farming setting. That's about as good a description as I can offer. <span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">Currently though, there's not really a huge amount different to VS and other survivor-like games. </span></p>
<p>It has the fun factor but is that enough when there's just <em>oh-so-many</em> similar games? Tough to answer fully. Right now, it feels like it needs more time in the oven to really add in more of a <em>unique</em> pull of which there <em>isn't</em> really enough of one.</p>
<p>During Early Access they said clearly they plan to add in more "Characters, Tools, Harvest items, and Game modes" — so hopefully they manage to add in a proper unique pull for it.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist waves of enemies through nights and days.</li>
<li>20 minutes play sessions.</li>
<li>A variety of upgradeable Tools to wipe out the swarm once and for all. Your belt can carry a maximum of 6; your choices will change the outcome.</li>
<li>Rescue and team up with the cutest companions. Some will heal you, while others will fight at your side.</li>
<li>Collect the perfect crop combination to achieve game-breaking builds.</li>
<li>Accessibility. Tweak monsters' health, speed, and damage to better suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429310/Noxious_Weeds/" target="_blank">Noxious Weeds on Steam</a>. There's also a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398640/Noxious_Weeds_Prologue/" target="_blank">Noxious Weeds: Prologue</a> to try.</p>

      <title>GodotOS is a fun showcase of Godot Engine with a fake operating system interface</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No GodotOS is not another Linux distribution or desktop environment, it's an open source fake operating system interface made in Godot Engine, designed to push the limits of UI design in Godot. It's also just really cool.</p>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to GodotOS, an operating system interface created entirely in Godot! Browse folders, edit text files, view images, play games, and more in one cohesive polished interface that can even be used on the web!</p>
<p>GodotOS is more of a toy than a serious project. It's meant to push the limits on UI design in Godot while creating a desktop that is minimalist, distraction-free, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Aside from that, GodotOS is also meant to be a hub for small games and experiences that can easily be bundled in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21393223381705324068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21393223381705324068gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you have a small game / experience you want to add into it, they're also accepting contributions. I love crazy experimental stuff like this, especially when it's open source (AGPL-3.0 license), because it allows people to learn from it and UI design is something that can be tricky to get right in any game engine — so perhaps game devs from all over might want to take a look at this.</p>
<p><em>I just thought it was really cool and thought you might think so too.</em></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://popcar2.itch.io/godotos" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/popcar2/GodotOS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, it is even has a trailer:</p>

      <title>Old World - Wonders &amp; Dynasties is a content-filled DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is easily one of the best 4X games to be released in recent years, that is still quite largely overlooked compared to others in the genre and it only keeps getting better. A big new content DLC Wonders &amp; Dynasties has just been released.</p>
<p>The Old World - Wonders &amp; Dynasties brings with it over 100 new dynasty-related events and 21 character traits to augment the 30 new dynasty leaders. Each leader comes with unique starting modifiers and is supported by a cast of 120 new historical characters that can be recruited during the course of a session. Overall it sounds like a pretty essential addition to an already fantastic game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3QIGe_ia6H0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c6650b1a323d8b6f3ff798cada225a9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3QIGe_ia6H0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A big patch was also released along with the DLC to include extra map randomisation options, UI and AI improvements, they added heir name selection popup on birth of an heir and a whole lot of bug fixes and other general game improvements to keep it running smoothly.</p>
<p>On Steam, Old World has a Very Positive user rating with Native Linux support and a Steam Deck Playable rating.</p>

<p>Valve has released the latest Steam Client stable update for both the Steam Deck and Desktop Steam, pulling in all the recent changes like the re-designed Steam Workshop subscriptions system.</p>

      <title>AYANEO Next Lite with a customized SteamOS-like HoloISO fully revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AYANEO has now revealed the specifications and pricing for the Linux powered AYANEO Next Lite, which will be using the SteamOS-like HoloISO, although customized by AYANEO for the handheld.</p>
<p>Initially AYANEO announced it as using SteamOS, and later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">clarified to GamingOnLinux</a> that it was actually HoloISO customized. I did ask <em>what</em> they've tweaked but they simply said "we've made some changes to adapt the NEXT LITE hardware and drivers, and I'm very sorry I can't tell you exactly at this time". So it's not a plain HoloISO install of course, they have done their own tweaks for their hardware.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-installed HoloISO Linux .</li>
<li>7" 800P IPS True Color Screen.</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen™ 5 4500U / AMD Ryzen™ 7 4800U.</li>
<li>16GB LPDDR4x 4266Mhz RAM.</li>
<li>Colour options: Pastel Blue / Bright White / Jet Black.</li>
<li>"NEXT Grip" Ergonomic Grip.</li>
<li>Hall Sensing Big Joysticks + Hall Triggers.</li>
<li>Custom Dual-copper Pipe Cooling System.</li>
<li>X-axis Linear Motor + Six-axis Gyroscope.</li>
<li>47Wh High-capacity Battery.</li>
<li>Two USB 3.2 type C + One USB 3.2 type C (data only) + headphones jack.</li>
<li>Weight: 720g.</li>
<li>WiFi 6 / Bluetooth 5.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>No date is actually being announced for release just yet, AYANEO simply told me "It will be officially available at the AYANEO online store in the near future" and that they "will offer exclusive early bird pricing for the first 100 customers, who can get the AMD 4500U version with 16G RAM and 512G stroage [<em>sic</em>] for just $299 with free shipping". For now, you can simply subscribe to their newsletter on the <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html" target="_blank">official page</a> to get notified when it becomes available.</p>
<p>Main pricing will be $299 for the Ryzen 5 4500U with a 128GB SSD, $349 with a 512GB SSD and $399 for the model with an AMD Rzen 7 4800U. You'll be able to upgrade the storage as they say it supported up to 8TB with M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 models.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch to get &#39;Item Factions&#39;, a unique item trading system for the ARPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch is closing in on a full release and it's going to be a big one for ARPG fans, especially if you weren't fussed by the latest Diablo. Now they've revealed what they call Item Factions, a unique system to allow item trading between players.</p>
<p>"Balancing a trade system is one of the most difficult challenges in a loot-based game, because it significantly impacts the item hunt for all players,” said Judd Cobler, Founder and CEO of Eleventh Hour Games, and game director on Last Epoch. “Players are often split over an economy that can add value to their items and builds, and the thrill of the hunt that leads to uncovering unique items. But with crucial feedback from our community, we’ve implemented a solution we believe satisfies both sides of the debate, and is a truly unique take on the action RPG trade debate."</p>
<p>The idea of Item Factions is to give players a <em>choice</em> in how they play, and it ties directly into the lore of Last Epoch too with a fair amount of depth to the feature. You get to pick between joining one of two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Merchants Guild</strong> - grants the ability to trade items with other players through the Bazaar, and player-to-player.</li>
<li><strong>Circle of Fortune</strong> - grants boosts to items you find yourself through Prophecies, and passive bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you get the best of both worlds available to players. Seems you won't be permanently locked into your choice either, but staying in one to rank up has various benefits.</p>
<p>Have a look at their explainer video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SOo0Ule6dNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8eee34dcd706ba4be50f6ae34a1c43b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SOo0Ule6dNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/trade-item-factions/61722" target="_blank">update on it here</a>.</p>
<p>Last Epoch leaves Early Access on February 21st, 2024. It has Native Linux support and is currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck, although it does work. Running it through Proton seems to be the best way to play though, as their Native Linux version has various graphical issues reported.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING gets patched to fix up anti-cheat on Steam Deck SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While no doubt many of you are waiting on more news about the upcoming ELDEN RING expansion, this is not it. Instead, a small update has rolled out to improve ELDEN RING on Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>The one liner in the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1245620/view/6002801934196500690" target="_blank">notes</a>: "Easy Anti-Cheat update to support the Steam OS update". They say version 1.10.1 is required now for any online play, so make sure you're up to date. They also confirmed they will "continue to provide improvement updates in the future so you can enjoy ELDEN RING more comfortably".</p>
<p>At least we know From Software continue to see the Steam Deck as an important platform. Not surprising though, they've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/armored-core-vi-will-be-fully-supported-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">previously</a> mentioned how happy they were seeing ELDEN RING run on Steam Deck and made sure Armored Core 6 worked as well. </p>

      <title>Challenging platformer VVVVVV gets a big upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VVVVVV is an indie classic from Terry Cavanagh that just got a nice juicy upgrade with version 2.4 now officially released that brings with it a Steam Deck Verified status.</p>
<p>Not only is VVVVVV now Steam Deck Verified but the update includes translations into 21 languages, improved custom level support, lots of bug fixes, an upgrade to the SDL version used, it's swapped over from SDL_mixer to FAudio for audio, performance improvements as it's moved from being mostly CPU-based to being mostly GPU-based (via SDL's 'render' subsystem) and much <a href="https://vsix.dev/wiki/Version_2.4" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5210128731704980410gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5210128731704980410gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of this is thanks to the source code release on <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, although it's not open source, and instead uses a custom license but that hasn't stopped people contributing to improve it.</p>

      <title>Multiple shoot &#39;em ups from Taito like G-Darius HD got fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taito and M2 have been bringing some updated shoot 'em up classics to Steam with lots of enhancements, and players seem to love them. Now titles like G-Darius HD should work great on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In release order they are the Darius Cozmic Collection Arcade (2021), G-Darius HD (2022) and Ray’z Arcade Chronology (2023) and technically each one is actually a bundle of multiple games. So that's a whole lot of shoot 'em up action you can grab. The developers noted that some SteamOS updates caused problems, so they updated all of them to get them working smoothly again!</p>
<p>You can see the trailer for G-Darius HD below:</p>

      <title>Team Fortress: Source 2 fan project gets a DMCA from Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Team Fortress: Source 2 project is now officially dead in the water after getting hit with a DMCA from Valve, although the creators were already stopping development.</p>
<p>For a quick bit of context — Team Fortress: Source 2 was a complete remake being done in <a href="https://sbox.facepunch.com/about/" target="_blank">s&amp;box</a>, which is a game creation toolkit from Facepunch, it's supposed to be a next-generation Garry's Mod. While it may be based on Source 2, it's quite different, and naturally under a specific license for Facepunch to use. That doesn't mean anyone can just use Valve's game assets inside s&amp;box.</p>
<p>You can see the DMCA on <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-valve.md" target="_blank">GitHub</a> which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original copyrighted work is Valve's game Team Fortress ("TF2") <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/</a>. The TF2 assets have been ported to Source 2 without permission and are being redistributed by Amper Software in a game mode for Facepunch's S@box. Facepunch has not licensed any Valve assets for S@box. The unauthorized porting and redistributing of Valve's assets without a license violates Valve's IP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason they kept calling it S@box, but it's s&amp;box. Quite a few thought it might be someone pretending to be working for Valve to be malicious, like apparently has happened with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/stalker-game-engine-openxray-gets-taken-down-on-github/" target="_blank">take-down of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay recently</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on X (formerly Twitter), the Team Fortress: Source 2 <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortressS2/status/1745157814295617767" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we were discussing the project's future internally recently, we already came to the conclusion to stop the development of the project due to the current state of the code being unusable anymore with s&amp;box's recent major engine changes, and that we overall moved on from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in a follow-up, mentioning this is basically the final nail in the coffin. So regardless, they were stopping anyway and it would be broken.</p>
<p>This has caused quite the commotion on social media, with many (even a few bigger industry names I've seen), calling out Valve about taking it down forcefully in such a way. Many arguing this is "not the Valve of old", and that Valve are "going after modders" and plenty more. But, there's a difference between modding an existing game, and remaking them entirely in a different game engine. I've said this before when it comes to Nintendo, Rockstar and *insert big name*, if you use someone else's IP, they will eventually come knocking and take it down. And in this case, it was a remake of a game that is still online and still technically (debatable I know) supported and making Valve money.</p>
<p>Even Garry Newman of Facepunch has now <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1745317860363108527" target="_blank">commented</a> on the situation to make it clear too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think while it's maybe out of character for Valve to take down fan projects like this, it's hardly surprising when you have their entire game uploaded. I somehow don't think the "old Valve" would have let anyone port Half-Life to another engine and host it all publicly either.</p>
<p>S&amp;box doesn't have a license to use Valve's content, only the engine. It's not a mod, it's not gmod. We didn't want to commit a chunk of profit so early in development when we don't even know what the final product will look like.</p>
<p>Amper did a really great job porting and making this all work. Sadly it was going to all be broken next week with the Scene System update, so at least this saves them the job of updating to be compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Additionally, Valve also asked the creator of a recent Portal Nintendo 64 port to take it down (not a DMCA), as it used proprietary Nintendo tech.</em> </p>

      <title>Toaplan Arcade Shoot &#39;Em Up Collection Vol. 3 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more classics are getting a new life on PC with the Toaplan Arcade Shoot 'Em Up Collection Vol. 3 announced for release on February 1st along with Linux and Steam Deck support just like the previous collections.</p>
<p>Games included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiger-Heli: This is where it all started. Tiger-Heli, Toaplan's pioneering bomb-based vertical shooter set the stage for an entire genre back in 1985!</li>
<li>Vimana: Uncover the magic of Indian mythology, unique power-ups, and an enchanting soundtrack in this electrifying space showdown!</li>
<li>FixEight: Toaplan's thrilling vertical run-and-gun game features eight peerless warriors with cutting-edge weapons!</li>
<li>Batsugun: The epic conclusion of Toaplan's legendary shooter series. Play the original or Batsugun Special. Choose your favorite character and spaceship in this thrilling sci-fi adventure!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828064891704972060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828064891704972060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As usual, the updated releases come with a whole bunch of improvements thanks to the emulation involved. Some of the enhancements are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra customizable practice mode!</li>
</ul>
<p>My testing of the previous two collections was great, as they really did work exceptionally well on both Steam Deck and my Linux gaming desktop - so I expect more of the same goodness from this latest collection since they're clearly using the same software base for them all. It's just good to see more classic games get modernised like this, enabling them to be played easily.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy the games from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games-toaplan" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan/list/116815" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO NEXT LITE handheld announced with SteamOS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 11/01/24 10:18 AM UTC</strong> - AYANEO replied to my email to give a tiny bit more info on their Linux OS use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SteamOS pre-installed on NEXT LITE is adapted and optimized by AYANEO based on HoloISO. Users also can install Windows system by themselves after purchasing NEXT LITE, and download Windows driver from AYANEO official website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HoloISO is <em>not</em> actually SteamOS, but very close. So this is <em>not</em> in any way a partnership being done with Valve. HoloISO for those not aware can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <em>anyone</em> can use it. I've asked if they can share what changes they've made.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Finally we're seeing another handheld vendor jump in with Linux. The AYANEO NEXT LITE was announced today and much like the Steam Deck, they plan to ship it with SteamOS! AYANEO are one of the top brands when it comes to PC handhelds, so it's really interesting to see them be one of the first to jump in like this. If Linux is a success for them, no doubt they will do more and other vendors will follow along.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting some next-gen power-house though, this is a "value-for-money option" but with various great sounding features like Hall Effect Joysticks, a 7-inch 800p display, a 47Wh battery, X-axis linear motors "and other features".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, this forward-looking flagship handheld, AYANEO NEXT, returns in full force with the rejuvenated AYANEO NEXT LITE. Building upon the foundation of top-tier flagship design and texture, AYANEO NEXT LITE comes pre-installed with the SteamOS gaming system for the first time. AYANEO NEXT LITE integrates outstanding cost-effectiveness, lowering the entry barrier while further popularizing numerous flagship features, offering an upgraded experience to more players, and allowing them to enjoy the endless fun and convenience of gaming handhelds.</p>
<cite>AYANEO</cite></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8524630221704904563gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8524630221704904563gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AYANEO say "subscriptions" will open 9:30 PM EST on January 11th EST / 2:30 AM January 12th UTC. They haven't revealed specifications or the pricing yet, so we assume that will be revealed then. The announcement post also showed off two different colour variations with a white shell and orange shoulder buttons like above, plus a black shell with grey shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>Currently it's not clear how they're using SteamOS. As Valve have not announced any kind of partnership, and there's no official public SteamOS 3 release yet. We know Valve wanted to get SteamOS on other devices, and all those discussions would have of course been behind closed doors until an announcement. So maybe Valve will say something soon. I've reached out to both Valve and AYANEO for an answer anyway.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they were previously working on their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ayaneo-confirm-their-linux-based-ayaneo-os-arrives-this-year/" target="_blank">Linux-based AYANEO OS</a> that was due in 2023, but perhaps that was shelved in favour of SteamOS directly to prevent fragmentation.</p>
<p>What do we think, AMD still like most others or Intel this time like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/msi-officially-announced-the-claw-a1m-handheld-with-intel/" target="_blank">the MSI Claw</a>?</p>

      <title>League of Legends likely unplayable on Linux / Steam Deck soon due to Vanguard anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day we expected to come but now Riot Games have formally announced that their Vanguard kernel-level anti-cheat is coming to League of Legends, and so it will make it unplayable on Linux. This is the same tech they use in VALORANT, which is also unplayable on Linux due to it.</p>
<p>This news was confirmed in their recent developer video below at about 12:43, mentioning it will happen in either late February or early March:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9U_jEzKf0_0?rel=0&amp;start=763"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b41ba871fa4517d31a8352ef0d60374.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9U_jEzKf0_0?rel=0&amp;start=763" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking on Reddit, one of their team <a href="https://sh.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kggm0yu/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "We'll get some more info about Linux for you all soon, it's not something i know the answer to off the top of my head and I want to make sure I talk with the team and get you the right info.", and in a previous comment they <a href="https://sh.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kggda9u/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> Vanguard won't be used in the macOS version.</p>
<p>However, a different Riot staff member seemed to make it clear Linux support won't be happening in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kgh17uo/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">reply</a> to a user asking about playing it in Wine: "No unfortunately not. From a security point of view supporting WINE would be like having a bank vault at the top of Nakatomi Tower then installing a doggy door in it.".</p>
<p>Considering that to play it on Linux you need to run the Windows version through Wine, there's no way they're going to roll out Vanguard into the Windows client and just let Linux get off without it. So I fully expect it to become unplayable in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Seems like it's time for League of Legends players on Linux to finally swap over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Valve's Dota 2</a>, which has full Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Usurper turns Chess into a deck-building roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love strategy games, board games, deck-builders and roguelikes you may want to keep a little eye on Usurper, an upcoming game from Rogue Brain Studios that releases later this year. Currently aiming for a "Q2" release.</p>
<p>Offering the classic with a modern twist you start off with only a King, and then work your way up to a full army by purchasing pieces from your deck. Sounds like an interesting spin! The developer mentions it will have a full single-player mode against the AI, along with local and online multiplayer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="doh3p7Zrnbg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/341e76f7c87741e8cd152f9d9fe148df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/doh3p7Zrnbg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Palworld is Pokémon with guns, farming, survival and building - I&#39;m quite excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After growing up playing Pokémon, I will jump at the chance to try pretty much anything that involves some form of monster collection. It's just my jam and Palworld looks and sounds kind of hilarious that I need to play it. </p>
<p>It's basically taking the initial idea of Pokémon and expanding it with guns, farming, survival, building and apparently quite a lot more. It's actually sprinkling in game mechanics from all sorts of popular games. Even if a bit janky, which I expect since it will be in Early Access on January 19th, it's quite likely to be the <em>next big thing</em>.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Survival</u></strong></li>
<li>In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.</li>
<li><strong><u>Mounts &amp; Exploration</u></strong></li>
<li>Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.</li>
<li><strong><u>Building Structures</u></strong></li>
<li>Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals.</li>
<li><strong><u>Production</u></strong></li>
<li>Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.</li>
<li><strong><u>Farming</u></strong></li>
<li>Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.</li>
<li><strong><u>Factories &amp; Automation</u></strong></li>
<li>Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.</li>
<li><strong><u>Dungeon Exploration</u></strong></li>
<li>With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.</li>
<li><strong><u>Breeding &amp; Genetics</u></strong></li>
<li>Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!</li>
<li><strong><u>Poaching &amp; Crime</u></strong></li>
<li>Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.</li>
<li><strong><u>Multiplayer</u></strong></li>
<li>Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be testing this one out on Steam Deck and my Kubuntu Linux desktop with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> for sure, so expect a report on how it runs some time shortly after release. The game is made with Unreal Engine 5, so it will be real interesting to see how the Steam Deck handles it, although graphically it doesn't look too demanding but graphics and style are of course only one part of the performance puzzle. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fantastic news for Like a Dragon fans as the latest in the series Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth has been checked over and confirmed Steam Deck Verified by Valve ahead of the release.</p>
<p>It will arrive on January 25th, and the previews coming in from elsewhere have been pretty glowing, so it's good to see another major upcoming release that will work great on Steam Deck (and so Linux desktop too!). Valve gave it the Verified rating with the current Proton 8.0-4.</p>

      <title>Valve announces new rules for games with AI Content on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now confirmed their rules for game developers using AI generated content on Steam, and while they're not banning AI they are going to ensure it's clearly stated for players. Like it or not, "AI" use is only going to increase in the games industry and so Valve had to do something and what they've announced sounds reasonable enough.</p>
<p>When developers fill out a survey for Valve to get their game on Steam, it now includes AI disclosures developers have to fill out and they separate it into two categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Generated: Any kind of content (art/code/sound/etc) created with the help of AI tools during development. Under the Steam Distribution Agreement, you promise Valve that your game will not include illegal or infringing content, and that your game will be consistent with your marketing materials. In our pre-release review, we will evaluate the output of AI generated content in your game the same way we evaluate all non-AI content - including a check that your game meets those promises.</li>
<li>Live-Generated: Any kind of content created with the help of AI tools while the game is running. In addition to following the same rules as Pre-Generated AI content, this comes with an additional requirement: in the Content Survey, you'll need to tell us what kind of guardrails you're putting on your AI to ensure it's not generating illegal content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve said they will also "include much of your disclosure on the Steam store page for your game, so customers can also understand how the game uses AI". So with that, if you plan to avoid AI games, at least Valve will give you a clear way to spot them.</p>
<p>On top of that Valve said they're implementing a new system to allow players to "report illegal content inside games that contain Live-Generated AI content", which you'll do via the Steam Overlay.</p>
<p>Together these rules and features allow Valve to be "much more open to releasing games using AI technology on Steam" but Valve said clearly that Adult Only Sexual Content created with Live-Generated AI is not currently allowed on Steam. That one feels like an obvious one to not allow, for reasons I'm sure I don't need to go into.</p>
<p>What do you think to Valve's stance on this?</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay gets taken down on GitHub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 11/01/2024, 11:55 AM UTC</strong>: The GitHub repository has been restored now. Hopefully this won't happen in future, considering as noted below, GSC Game World actually gave it their blessing to be used. And thanks to the take-down, <em>even mor</em>e people now know about it. From the reversal <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-xray-16-reversal.md" target="_blank">notice</a>, GitHub stated clearly after a review it was a fraudulent take-down.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>OpenXRay is an improved cross-platform version of the X-Ray Engine, which is the original game engine used in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series by GSC Game World. However, it seems a bad actor got it taken down from GitHub.</p>
<p>Currently the <a href="https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> notes "Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown" and the DMCA can be <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-08-xray-16.md" target="_blank">read here</a>, which is claimed to be from "Anti-Piracy Protection" on behalf of GSC Game World. </p>
<p>However, on X (formerly Twitter), the official GSC Game World <a href="https://twitter.com/GSC_GW/status/1744528469013237813" target="_blank">account noted</a> it wasn't their doing, and that "Open X-Ray is totally allowed to be used as a modbase" and that they're dealing with "a wave of false claims caused by our position recently":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061962711704823083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061962711704823083gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So with that in mind, hopefully GitHub will reinstate it and prevent this from happening again from the same people trying to cause issues for them. It's also nice to see, at least according to who is posting on their social account, that they have no problems with people using OpenXRay considering it's based on leaked code.</p>
<p>The code has been out so long now, and used by so many for such old games, it would have been pretty strange to only now go after it. Especially since it requires data files from the original games to run, so people still need to buy the games to use OpenXRay.</p>

      <title>MSI officially announced the Claw A1M handheld with Intel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Well there it is! MSI Claw A1M is the official name of the next big vendor to jump into the handheld gaming space to take on the likes of the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. Unlike the Steam Deck which runs SteamOS Linux, once again we have a vendor going with Windows 11.</p>
<p>From the press release: "In our commitment to enhancing the gaming experience for our users, we aim to address market pain points and dedicate efforts to the handheld space,” said Eric Kuo, the Executive Vice President&amp; NB BU GM of MSI. “We have fine-tuned specific designs tailored exclusively for gamers, debuting our very first handheld, Claw, which redefines the standards in the handheld market."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8964253901704808019gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8964253901704808019gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>MSI say it offers MSI Cooler Boost Hyperflow technology, featuring dual fans and heat pipes that efficiently dissipate heat, and that the intraflow thermal design optimizes airflow to cool internal components "ensuring top gaming performance". They're also bringing their "MSI Center M UI" to it giving quick-access to various features and settings like a game launcher. So once again, it's another UI being slapped on top of Windows.</p>

<p>I'm always happy to see more competition for the Steam Deck, but it remains to be seen just how it will perform. And it will come in multiple different configurations with different storage. In terms of performance, from what I've seen from YouTube videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxoxXbc0Ros" target="_blank">Dave2D</a> it's quite limited as they weren't allowed to do much yet on benchmarking but it's somewhat comparable to the ROG Ally. Again though, it seems another case of it needing to draw more power for better performance.</p>
<p>The MSI Claw releases sometime in the first half of 2024.</p>

      <title>Cross-distribution support improvements coming for Canonical&#39;s Snap packages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, 2024 should be interesting for Linux packaging! While many distributions use different packaging formats like deb, rpm and others there's also Flatpak for cross-distro support. But we also have Canonical's Snap - which is going to get <em>improved</em> cross-distro support.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, developer Zygmunt Krynicki <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zygoon@fosstodon.org/111703074889722934" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "I will be returning as a snap developer later this month. My main focus will be cross-distribution support. Unlike in the past this will be my full time job. I'm very excited for what is ahead for snaps.". It's interesting to see Canonical paying developers to work on this (and it's a good thing too)!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2274750401704805502gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2274750401704805502gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store" target="_blank">The Snap Store</a></em></p>
<p>Packaging is always a real sore spot for Linux, and it leads to a fair amount of confusion. Just like with how many Linux distributions there are there's upsides and downsides to it though of course. You don't get innovation and improvements by always sticking to one single thing, and the power of open source is people can often just work on whatever they want.</p>
<p>Still, it would be nice no matter what distribution of Linux you pick, if we can just tell people to "go here" to get whatever app it is they're after rather than having to do a support-dance to find out their specific distribution and version to see what's available to find out how they can grab something.</p>

      <title>OpenAI say it would be &#39;impossible&#39; to train AI without pinching copyrighted works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really fear for the internet and what it will become in even just another year, with the rise of AI writing and AI art being used in place of real people. And now OpenAI openly state they need to use copyrighted works for training material.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright infringement and just recently OpenAI sent a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/126981/pdf/" target="_blank">submission</a> to the UK House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee where OpenAI said pretty clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression– including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents–it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials. Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today’s citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting OpenAI put up their own news post "<a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism" target="_blank">OpenAI and journalism</a>" on January 8th.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Why am I writing about this here? Well, the reasoning is pretty simple. AI writing is (on top of other things) increasing the race to the bottom of content for clicks. Search engines have quickly become a mess to find what you actually want, and it's only going to continue getting <em>far worse</em> thanks to all these SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) bait content farms, with more popping up all the time, and we've already seen some bigger websites trial AI writing. The internet is a <em>mess</em>.</p>
<p>As time goes on, and as more people use AI to pinch content and write entire articles, we're going to hand off profitable writing to a select few big names only who can weather the storm and handle it. A lot of smaller scale websites are just going to die off. Any time you search for something, it will be those big names sprinkled in between the vast AI website farms all with very similar robotic plain writing styles.</p>
<p>Many (most?) websites make content for search engines, <em>not</em> for people. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization" target="_blank">The Verge</a> recently did a rather fascinating piece on this showing how websites are designed around Google, and it really is something worth scrolling through and reading.</p>
<p>One thing you can count on: my perfectly <em>imperfect</em> writing full of <em>terrible</em> grammar continuing without the use of AI. At least it's <em>natural</em> right? I write as I speak, for better or worse. By humans, for humans — a tagline I plan to stick with until AI truly takes over and I have to go find a job flipping burgers or something. But then again, there will be robots for that too. <em>I think I need to learn how to fish…</em></p>

      <title>Unity cutting 25% of staff (about 1,800 people) as part of restructuring</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. We're only just into week 2 of 2024 and Unity Software are cutting away a huge amount of their staff, as things aren't looking great for the Unity game engine.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/unity-software-cutting-25-staff-company-reset-continuation-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> who picked up the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000181080624000006/unity-20240108.htm" target="_blank">filing</a>, Unity announced "it plans to reduce approximately 1,800 employee roles, or approximately 25% of its current workforce, as it restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth".</p>
<p>According to the interim CEO Jim Whitehurst: "We are reducing the number of things we are doing in order to focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability".</p>
<p>Plenty of this is still from the ongoing fallout of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">absolute mess</a> that was runtime fee, that caused <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-leaving-effective-immediately/" target="_blank">John Riccitiello to leave as CEO</a>. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Unity is used by some of the most popular games around and according to SteamDB over 40,000 games on Steam use Unity. This includes hits like Vampire Survivors, Lethal Company, Hollow Knight, Valheim, Rust, Cities: Skylines, RimWorld and the list just goes on and on to name only a semi-recent popular few that you likely know of.</p>
<p>Hopefully Unity will stabilise soon, because I can't imagine what the atmosphere is like to work there right now, imagine having all this like a black cloud over your head? With a probability of more to come as the restructuring continues. Game developers need things to calm down too, since many thousands rely on it for upcoming and existing games still being supported.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-26 and 8-27 released with various game fixes for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton has received two new versions with GE-Proton 8-26 and GE-Proton 8-27 shortly after, mostly focusing on fixing up issues in some games and pulling in new versions of various parts of Proton like Wine and DXVK.</p>
<p>This is the community-made compatibility layer, so it's not supported by Valve, and should be used only really when you need it for specific games.</p>
<p>The changes for GE-Proton 8-26 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>updated wine to bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to git</li>

<li>NVIDIA Reflex implemented (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/pull/104" target="_blank">#104</a> thanks loathingKernel)</li>
</ul>
<p>protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>unified fix for cpu topology workaround (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/protonfixes/pull/167" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll/protonfixes#167</a> thanks Root-Core)</li>

<li>unified fix for esync/fsync enable/disable added (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/protonfixes/pull/169" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll/protonfixes#169</a> thanks R1kaB3rN)</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then for GE-Proton 8-27:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Disabled Nvidia Latency Reflex patches. After discussion with dxvk devs they are currently deemed problematic and need more work, and are known to currently cause stutters in games even when the feature is disabled. We will re-enable the patches when they are ready.</li>
<li>Fixed Farlight 84 patch that was missing a lock causing problems in SDL games</li>
<li>Backported a fix for HID devices with more than 8 axis <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55660" target="_blank">https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55660</a></li>

      <title>Celebrate Economic Strategy with the Steam Capitalism and Economy Fest</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Economy simulation and city management may not be the first thing most people think of when they think about video games. But it is one of the most longstanding genres in gaming, going all the way back to the 1980's. And if you've been looking to get into the genre or just check something new out, now's a great time with an entire sale highlighting some of the most noteworthy modern simulation games.</p>
<p>From the beloved Cities: Skylines to obscure stuff like Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, there's a little something for everyone in this sale. As my expertise in game genres is more blowing stuff up than planning economies; I'll instead be going through a sampler platter and determining the best games in the sale based on reviews, how interesting it looks to me, and how good a deal it is.</p>
<p>It should be noted these aren't games that optimally fit into the Steam Deck's normal control format, but we'll list Deck support anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/" target="_blank">Cities Skylines</a> ($<s>29.99</s> $8.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable / Native Linux Support</p>

<p>Like I've said, my economy simulator knowledge isn't great. So I welcome any additional game suggestions in the comments I might have missed that you love. You can check out the sale <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/capitalism_economy" target="_blank">here </a>and keep in mind that it runs until January 15 at 10 AM PST / 6PM UTC.</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/amd-announces-radeon-rx-7600-xt-ryzen-8000g-series-and-new-ryzen-5000-series-cpus/" target="_blank">AMD did today for CES 2024</a>, much of NVIDIA's event was also all about AI but there's a few bits in there for normal consumers like the announcement of Half-Life 2 RTX, plus GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX is using RTX Remix, just like Portal with RTX and Portal: Prelude RTX, and it's community-made by "four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios" who are "rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve’s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers".</p>
<p>First look video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aM_gzfAMdNs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e56751632013bf42dd4b7a5800a3a35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aM_gzfAMdNs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>NVIDIA have announced that RTX Remix will hit Open Beta on January 22nd.</p>
<p>As for the new GPUs coming they are they GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER which NVIDIA say "supercharge the latest games and form the core of AI-powered PCs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A 4K Monster: The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER</strong><br/>
The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER powers fully ray-traced games in 4K resolution. At 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti without DLSS Frame Generation, the RTX 4080 SUPER delivers blistering performance with traditional rasterization. With 836 AI TOPS, DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory for a performance edge. It will be available starting Jan. 31 from $999.</p>
<p><strong>Precision Gaming: The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER</strong><br/>
The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is the ideal GPU for maxing out games at super-high frame rates at 1440p, and up to 4K. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, it has more cores, an increased frame buffer to 16GB, and a 256-bit memory bus, providing a significant memory bandwidth increase to 672 GB/sec. It is 1.6x faster than a RTX 3070 Ti and 2.5x with DLSS 3. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 at $799.</p>
<p><strong>Perfectly Balanced: The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER</strong><br/>
The RTX 4070 SUPER arrives with 20% more cores than the RTX 4070, making it faster than an RTX 3090 at a fraction of the power. With DLSS 3, its lead stretches to 1.5x faster. It will be available starting Jan. 17 at $599.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something else they did a demo of during the event was NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace" target="_blank">ACE</a>), a "suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative AI", and showed off a scene of two characters giving entirely dynamic chat (although pretty robotic sounding). No doubt over the next few years we're going to see a lot more AI like this implemented into games to have randomly generated conversations with voice over and lip syncing all together.</p>

      <title>AMD announces Radeon RX 7600 XT, Ryzen 8000G series and new Ryzen 5000 series CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amongst a whole lot of technobabble about AI AI and more AI, AMD today announced the Radeon RX 7600 XT, Ryzen 8000G series and new Ryzen 5000 series CPUs. For any normal consumer, their event was a hard boring watch with business people patting each-other on the back about AI advancements but here's the gist of what was actually revealed today.</p>
<p>Firstly of all they announced the Radeon RX 7600 XT GPU with 16GB GDDR6 for 1080p gaming, starting at $329 releasing January 24th. Nothing really special here, it's a slight bump over the RX 7600 with more RAM, slightly boosted clock speeds and a higher typical board power at 190 W.</p>
<p>Now onto the processors, starting with the new AMD Ryzen 8000G Series desktop processors for the AM5 platform, which bring forth AMD's new dedicated AI neural processing unit (NPU) to desktop PC processors, built on top of Zen 4. All of the 8000G Series processors include a Radeon 700M series graphics too.</p>
<p>Here's the models available starting January 31st for SI partners and for OEMs in "Q2 2024":</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.9.1 released for easy compatibility tool installs on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt is an essential tool to help you install and manage GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda, Wine-GE and more for Steam, Heroic and Lutris for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>But why would you need it? Well, sometimes Valve's official Proton doesn't work well with a game, so you need GE-Proton. If you want to easily play third-party upgraded game engines for some classic Steam games like OpenMW for Morrowind or OpenXcom for X-COM and so on (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">see my previous article</a>) you can use Luxtorpeda and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.9.1" target="_blank">Version 2.9.1</a> was just released and here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a Shortcut Editor for Steam.</li>
<li>Dxvk-Async: Use <a href="https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync/" target="_blank">Ph42oN</a>'s releases instead of <a href="https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/" target="_blank">Sporif</a>'s.</li>
<li>NorthstarProton: Use the <a href="https://github.com/R2NorthstarTools/NorthstarProton" target="_blank">R2NorthstarTools</a> repo instead of the <a href="https://github.com/cyrv6737" target="_blank">cyrv6737</a> repo.</li>
<li>Wine-GE: Match extract folder name (see PR <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/pull/296" target="_blank">#296</a> for details).</li>
<li>Allow configuring GitHub/GitLab access tokens in the ProtonUp-Qt configuration file (see <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/issues/161#issuecomment-1358200080" target="_blank">#161 (comment)</a>).</li>
<li>Various i18n, UI and UX enhancements. </li>
</ul>

<p>How to install ProtonUp-Qt?</p>
<p>It's available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a> or using your favourite app store (like Discover on KDE Plasma / Steam Deck Destop Mode). Alternatively download the AppImage:</p>

<li>Mark the AppImage as executable (either using your file manager or using the Terminal: <code class="inline-code">chmod +x ProtonUp-Qt*.AppImage</code>).</li>
<li>Double-click the AppImage to run ProtonUp-Qt.</li>

      <title>JSAUX revealed an upgraded transparent RGB Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you've got a Steam Deck, an ROG Ally, a Lenovo Legion Go or whatever else is going from the likes of AYANEO and GPD you may want to look into the new upgraded transparent RGB Docking Station from JSAUX.</p>
<p>Much like the previous version you can get two different models with varying connections. Not only have they given it a transparent casing, which looks really slick, but they've upgraded the internals as well to offer ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), QFT (Quick Frame Transport) and HDR (High Dynamic Range). So it's quite a big spec boost to an already great little dock.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10179862111704719879gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10179862111704719879gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The models HB1201S ($99.99) and HB0801S ($69.99) are available for pre-sale, with expected shipping in mid-to-late January.</p>
<p>I actually have the original non-transparent one they sent over, and it is quite a nice little device with a lot of connections on it (the 12-in-1 version) that really does open up a lot of options when docking the Steam Deck regularly so I can happily suggest taking a look at the new upgraded transparent edition. My only gripe with it is the pull-out slot to actually put your handheld in feels just a little flimsy because of the thin plastic. Other than that - great.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/rgb-docking-station-for-steam-deck?_pos=1&amp;_sid=c3cb7bdbf&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=44315676573916" target="_blank">JSAUX store</a>.</p>

      <title>Okay boomers, you get a shooter category on Steam now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have finally done it, they've actually gone and made Boomer Shooter an official category on Steam. Since there's quite a lot of them now, and more releasing every day, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>From sound designer Andrew Hulshult on X (formerly Twitter) who <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewHulshult/status/1743039322406691283" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term "boomer shooter" was a lovingly cheeky term we saw used once when developing Dusk as a description for Doom. So we ran with it because it was funny. It would go on to be associated with a entire genre of shooters. Today it's a category on steam. I love this reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10029001931704716681gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10029001931704716681gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - the Boomer Shooter category, the top rotating banner.</em></p>
<p>From Dusk to ULTRAKILL, there's according to Steam 107 games in this category, with only 24 having Native Linux support but no doubt most if not all will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Looks like a few I missed too so I can't wait to dive in and get discovering a potential new favourite.</p>
<p>Go check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Boomer%20Shooter/" target="_blank">Boomer Shooter category</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam hits new user record for 2024 and a record for games released last year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yesterday, January 7th, Steam hit a new all-time record for concurrent users online showing that nothing can stop Valve's growth here thanks to the popularity of video games.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps even the Steam Deck has been helping push up the overall Steam user numbers. Wouldn't be a surprise there, considering that it does enable you to play more games wherever you are. I know I've been playing more since the Steam Deck released - have you?</p>
<p>The new record is 33,675,229 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, with the previous record of 33,598,520 hit back in March 2023. At the time of the new record 10,653,243 people were actually in-game.</p>
<p>Additionally, Steam had another record-breaking year in 2023 with 14,528 games being released versus 12,558 in 2022 and 11,388 in 2021 and 9,746 in 2020 and…you get the idea. Number goes up. <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> again tracking those numbers making it easy to see at a glance with 2019 being the odd one out there but the overall trend is that every year more and more games are being released on Steam since anyone with $100 can put something on Steam.</p>
<p>I used to think it was an issue, because there's an increasing number of (for lack of a better word) — <em>junk</em>. However, the low barrier to entry, and lack of direct curation by Valve, allows some truly unique stuff to appear and at times do <em>really</em> well. Valve having a more hands-off approach is probably better in the long run, as long as there's good tools for users to discover games they might be interested in, which Valve are gradually improving over time.</p>
<p><em>In case you missed it: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" target="_blank">Steam Deck also hit over 13,000 playable games</a> recently too!</em></p>
<p>How do you feel about so many games releasing each year?</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.7 is out now and it&#39;s one of the largest releases ever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the release of the Linux kernel 6.7 on Sunday, 7th January 2024 and as it turns out it's one of the largest releases ever.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=widprp4XoHUcsDe7e16YZjLYJWra-dK0hE1MnfPMf6C3Q@mail.gmail.com/" target="_blank">release announcement</a> Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we had a little bit more going on last week compared to the holiday week before that, but certainly not enough to make me think we'd want to delay this any further.</p>
<p>End result: 6.7 is (in number of commits: over 17k non-merge commits, with 1k+ merges) one of the largest kernel releases we've ever had, but the extra rc8 week was purely due to timing with the holidays, not about any difficulties with the larger release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going over all the notes here's just some of what's included that seem interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial <a href="https://bcachefs.org" target="_blank">Bcachefs</a> filesystem support.</li>
<li>Btrfs filesystem gains temporary filesystem fsid (temp_fsid) for use on systems like the Steam Deck, for "root partition A/B testing, or can be used for VM root images".</li>
<li>NVIDIA GPU System Processor (GSP) firmware support for the Nouveau open source driver.</li>
<li>Intel Meteor Lake graphics support is now enabled by default.</li>
<li>Enable seamless boot in more cases for AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Plenty of work for bringing up Intel Lunar Lake support.</li>
<li>More work on FUTEX2 which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/linux-kernel-516-is-out-now-bringing-the-futex2-work-to-help-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">originally created to help Linux gaming</a>.</li>
<li>Plenty of Rust improvements along with an update to the <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com" target="_blank">Rust for Linux website</a>.</li>
<li>Razer Wolverine V2 added to the xpad gamepad driver.</li>
<li>Various improvements to Logitech's wireless support for many devices.</li>
<li>A fix for a kernel crash when connecting Nintendo Joycons (reported on Steam Deck).</li>
</ul>
<p>The full complete kernel 6.7 <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.7" target="_blank">changelog is here</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.13 Preview improves WiFi, brings LED brightness controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed from yesterday Friday, January 5th is that Valve released another Preview update of SteamOS for Steam Deck with a couple more useful changes.</p>
<p>Code named "Here Be Dragons" here's all the changes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3860212413467404192" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.13 Preview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a slider to control the brightness of the Status LED (Charger LED). This setting can be found under Settings -&gt; Display.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where wifi would fail to connect in certain conditions</li>
<li>Fixed HDR on some external DisplayPort displays being slightly desaturated</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seen a few people note they had WiFi issues recently so hopefully the fix in this, along with the additional WiFi crash-fix from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steamos-3-5-12-preview-and-new-steam-deck-beta-and-steam-desktop-beta-released/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.12 Preview</a> will improve things overall.</p>
<p>How to access SteamOS Preview: go into Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel and select Preview from the drop-down box and then it will need you to restart.</p>
<p>Are you waiting on anything specific being fixed right now that isn't in the latest SteamOS 3.5 Preview versions? Or is there a feature you're desperate for Valve to add into SteamOS still? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>The big Portal 2 mod Portal: Revolution is out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Portal: Revolution is a new fan-made campaign for Valve's popular puzzle game Portal 2, and it's now available free on Steam for owners of the original. Taking place before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.</p>
<p>What do you get with it? Over 40 brand new puzzles making use of new game mechanics not seen in the original Portal 2 with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element.</li>
<li>New laser cube variant.</li>
<li>Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun.</li>
<li>Gel Cleansing Field.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KiCDXQXLiyo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/564e9b6b48422e376069cd2186a8135a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KiCDXQXLiyo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like it could be a good one! I never pass up a chance to play more Portal, hoping one day Valve give us Portal 3, but big mods like this will do <em>for now</em>.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/601360/Portal_Revolution/" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Ray-Tracing performance uplift coming to the AMD RADV Linux graphics driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source AMD RADV Vulkan driver is set to get some nice looking performance improvements for Ray-Tracing, which should release along with Mesa 24.0.</p>
<p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/26105" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> titled "Convert 1D ray launches to 2D" that has been accepted into Mesa developer Friedrich Vock mentioned "Because we use unaligned dispatches, 1D launches only use 8 threads per<br/>
wave. Converting to 2D and fixing up launch IDs in the prolog significantly increases occupancy." that gave a "~30% uplift in Ghostwire Tokyo".</p>
<p>Impressive and then you look into the comments and others are noting more performance improvements in other games too with Adriano Martins <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/26105#note_2162486" target="_blank">mentioning</a> these on an AMD RX 6700 XT:</p>

<p>Further to that in another <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/26105#note_2162898" target="_blank">comment</a> Adam Niederer also showed off improvements on their AMD 7900 XT at 2560x1440:</p>

<p>The MR was open since November 2023, with it being accepted and merged January 5th, 2024.</p>
<p>So it should be available in Mesa 24.0 which is due to release January 31st, 2024. Although that depends how the Release Candidates go with the first RC for Mesa 24.0 due January 10th, 2024.</p>

      <title>As of January 2024 - 75 of the Top 100 most played Steam games work on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an up to date look at the current state of the most played games on Steam, and how many of they run on Steam Deck and Linux as a whole. <em>In case you missed it: the Steam Deck recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" target="_blank">crossed over 13,000 games rated at least Playable</a>.</em></p>
<p>Checking via the Steam Deck Verified rating (either Verified or Playable), and then the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating across Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze or Broken / Linux Native Support for desktop Linux.</p>
<p>While the top 100 changes fairly often, it's an interesting way to look at overall compatibility. From top to bottom based on peak player count, here's how things stack up with this snapshot of Steam's most played taken on January 5th - 2024, 18:45 UTC.</p>
<p>Overall we're seeing <strong>75/100</strong> at least rated Playable on Steam Deck and <strong>78/100</strong> work on desktop Linux with a Gold rating on ProtonDB or higher (or the game has official Native Linux support). Of those, 26 advertise they have Native Linux support. Things are looking pretty good overall for the popular games!</p>

<p>So there you have it, that's the current state for the start of 2024. I purposefully kept in a few odd ones like Wallpaper Engine, and Rocket League even though you can no longer get it on Steam, since this is just taking the Top 100 as it is at the time for Steam overall.</p>
<p>At least 12 of the Unsupported games are due to anti-cheat issues, although some like SMITE do need a re-check from Valve. Anti-Cheat continues to be a major source of annoyance for Steam Deck / Linux gamers overall.</p>
<p>Are there any ratings for the games listed above you feel Valve need to change? If so, why? Let me know all your thoughts in the comments on the current state of things.</p>

      <title>Supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM finally hits Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll be forgiven for forgetting about the supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM, a game that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter way back in February of 2013 but it's really actually getting close to release now.</p>
<p>Refresher: "From the creators of cult sleeper hit Scratches and the haunting Serena, comes a chilling journey into the darkest depths of your mind. ASYLUM is an ambitious and intricate horror adventure casting you into the hallucinatory setting of the Hanwell Mental Institute, a silent witness to unimaginable atrocities that transpired between its endless corridors."</p>
<p>Developer Senscape put up a fresh <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/agustincordes/asylum-kickstart-the-horror/posts/3997237" target="_blank">announcement</a> on January 1st, 2024 mentioning the Beta milestone, with people outside their development team being able to play it through to the end for the first time. Sounds like it will give around 12 - 15 hours play time, and they have full controller support implemented along with "Steam Deck compatibility coming up".</p>
<p>As for their next steps? Going through all the feedback. Developer Agustín Cordes mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have more work to do. This first round of fresh feedback we received has been invaluable, but so far it presents a crucial milestone: the biggest worry for me has been the game might be too intricate, obtuse, or difficult to digest. Yet what I’m hearing is that, while further tweaks are required, ASYLUM is fun to play, the story is engaging, and keeps your interest until the end. Good exploration is hard to pull off: there’s a fine balance between giving the audience plenty of freedom and things to investigate while retaining a sense of direction and goals, to ensure the experience does not become frustrating. And it feels like we’re on the right track when one of the primary compliments I hear is that the Hanwell Mental Institute is a joy to explore. This is an accomplishment on a personal level, as the ability to explore at leisure has been the #1 thing I enjoy in games since I played King’s Quest for the first time many, many, many years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a little older now but I did a preview of the demo some time ago:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck officially hits over 13,000 games Playable and Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not too long after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-12000-games-playable-and-verified/" target="_blank">hitting 12,000 games</a>, the Steam Deck now officially has over 13,000 games rated either Verified or Playable. There must be a little something for every type of gamer now right? <em>My backlog is terrifying.</em></p>
<p>At time of writing the current numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 4,355</li>
<li>Playable: 8,751</li>
<li>Unsupported: 3,720</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out the full list on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Their list includes titles that have been hidden on Steam, but they still count and are still tested, as anyone who owns them can still download and play. There's various reasons games get hidden like music licenses expiring, developers going bust and so on.</p>
<p>Remember though: if a game <em>hasn't</em> been through Deck Verified to get a rating, you <em>can</em> still download and play it. Valve don't block you from trying, Deck Verified is simply what Valve have tested officially.</p>
<p>For Unsupported games though, that can be for a whole different bag of reasons.

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Early last month Valve put up a Release Candidate for the next version of Proton, which it seems went completely under the radar. Due to this they've not had much feedback for Proton 8.0-5 so time to get testing.</p>
<p>Posted in a pinned topic on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7318" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, we have no idea when it might actually release properly but you can get testing by finding Proton 8 in your Steam Library, going into the Properties, Betas and select the 8.0-5 Release Candidate from the drop-down box.</p>

      <title>MSI teasing a handheld gaming PC like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Begun, the handheld wars have. It seems like every company now wants a piece of the pie doesn't it? Even MSI appear to be jumping into the fold now with an announcement due at CES 2024.</p>
<p>We don't exactly have much to go on right now, other than the teaser they posted up on their <a href="http://www.instagram.com/p/C1rM-oos8JQ/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/msigaming/status/1742856060581331345" target="_blank">X</a> noting "A whole new breed of MSI dragon is coming.⁠ Get a grip and stay tuned.⁠"</p>
<p>Here's some quick stills from their teaser video:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15055753111704389528gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15055753111704389528gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726892731704389528gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8726892731704389528gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3615467281704389527gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3615467281704389527gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No doubt it will be another handheld running Windows though instead of Linux, but it's not like that has stopped people! Linux support for the ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, plus various units from GPD and AYANEO have been improving pretty quickly with <a href="https://chimeraos.org" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> being one of the best options.</p>
<p>It's always good to have options! Naturally I'll be sticking to the Steam Deck OLED since it's the most supported available with Linux out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: as a small addition, it seems this may be Intel powered given the <a href="https://twitter.com/IntelGaming/status/1742984222821024148" target="_blank">reply</a> on social media site X from the official Intel Gaming account with three thinking emoji. Obviously not a lot to go on, but why else would they reply like that?</p>

      <title>Mobile Suit Baba combines Baba Is You puzzling with Into the Breach strategy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indie developer Hempuli Oy has released a follow-up to their incredible puzzle game Baba Is You, this time taking the idea of Into the Breach from Subset Games and putting a new spin on it with Baba Is You word rules. The developer doesn't shy away from the inspiration and clearly states it too.</p>
<p>Here you get the small tiled arenas where you have to complete objectives, but you also have the various word blocks like "Hill Is Stop" that you can push around to change the rules of the level to complete the objectives. A fun idea and it does work quite well!</p>
<p>More: "A mysterious force is out to steal all the Fruit! Help Baba &amp; friends foil their plans by maneuvering gigantic mech suits around. Features tactical puzzling action, heart-wrenching storytelling and extra challenges over a total of 43 missions."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cIaCjtWsaQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b2c59c7685f5ce782ec3771289477a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cIaCjtWsaQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you love a blending of puzzles with turn-based strategy, this is one you'll probably enjoy. This isn't the only spin-off from Baba Is You as there's also <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-is-you-xtreme" target="_blank">Baba Is You XTREME</a> and <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-files-taxes" target="_blank">Baba Files Taxes</a> but this is so far the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Available for <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/mobile-suit-baba" target="_blank">$4 on itch.io</a>. There's no Linux version like with Baba Is You but my testing showed it working great with the latest Wine 9.0 RC 3.</p>

      <title>Bodycam horror shooter Chasmal Fear looks like a riot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MystiveDev emailed in about Chasmal Fear, an upcoming horror shooter you play as if you're viewing it from a bodycam set in an underwater facility.</p>
<p>More about it: "Chasmal Fear is a first-person tactical shooter survival horror game that puts players in a mysteriously empty sci-fi underwater facility where something has gone terribly wrong. Ammo is scarce. The odds are stacked against you. Choose wisely between fighting or sneaking past the monstrosities which once killed might mutate into something even worse. Unlock hidden areas and solve puzzles to uncover the truth of what happened in this top-secret facility. Every decision will impact your gameplay experience, some swarming relentless monsters against you while others offering the chance to employ stealth and cunning to survive."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Bq3RG8mcLZ8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd363ba52e8274f6cb8553755c11e34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Bq3RG8mcLZ8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When queried about Steam Deck and Linux support the developer mentioned: "Currently, the game is built for Windows, but we're aiming to make it playable both on Mac and Linux before full release."</p>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LIMITED RESOURCES - Limited player ammo and scarce ammo boxes will encourage players to think strategically and be cautious while traversing the abandoned steel hallways.</li>
<li>IMMERSIVE BODYCAM - Artistic direction that utilizes the perspective of a bodycam footage. Set in the near future, players are also equipped with an AR Interface to help you through the dark hallways of the Magnus Facility.</li>
<li>MONSTER MUTATION SYSTEM - Some monsters will randomly start to mutate when killed into a stronger form. Do not be surprised when you encounter more dangerous foes in an area you thought you cleaned out. Make sure to end them before the mutation starts.</li>
<li>CHOICES AFFECT YOUR PLAYTHROUGH - Your choices will affect your gameplay experience. Choosing to open one way will close other paths to your next goal. Depending on your choice, you can dive guns blazing or sneak stealthily above a swarm of enemies; hide in the shadows or use your environment to squash the monstrosities.</li>
<li>FULLY RANDOMIZED EVENTS - Randomized events occurring throughout the game that provide replayability from varying sounds, crumbling ceilings, floors and unexpected scares.</li>
<li>ULTRA-REALISTIC ENVIRONMENTS - Ultra-realistic, sci-fi underwater station built underneath the waves and inside a massive ocean cliff. Its hallways seem abandoned. It is up to you to find your way out and survive the things that lurk within.</li>
<li>CO-OP POSSIBILITY - Bring a friend to Chasmal Fear and survive this nightmare together. The difficulty changes procedurally based on whether you play singleplayer or multiplayer co-op.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>dotAGE now Steam Deck Verified and sold over 30K copies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing that the indie dream for some is alive and well, the merciless survival roguelite turn-based city builder dotAGE has managed to sell over 30,000 copies in three months. It's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>The solo developer of the game, Michele Pirovano, announced the sales milestone on <a href="https://twitter.com/dotagegame/status/1741048989334814907" target="_blank">X</a> (formerly Twitter) noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the end of the year in sight, I am very happy to announce that dotAGE has now sold more than 30k copies on Steam! This is an indie dream made real! Not even in my wildest dreams I would have thought of reaching such a milestone!! Thank you so much for all your support!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering that last year we saw over 14,000 games released (the most ever in one year for Steam), it goes to show that a good game can sell well even with insane competition from developers of all sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042007891704378750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042007891704378750gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The other good news is that as of January 3rd, the game has been Steam Deck Verified by Valve! dotAGE has Native Linux support too and there's even a demo.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/638510/dotAGE/" target="_blank">dotAGE on Steam</a>. The developer previously sent over a copy, and I fully recommend grabbing a copy — it's great and easily one of my highlights of 2023.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint planning an upgraded EDGE ISO with kernel 6.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people wanting to install Linux Mint on newer devices, the Linux Mint team have announced a plan to update their EDGE ISOs with a later Linux kernel in the latest <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4619" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post goes over recent funding, of which December 2023 was a high-point and the most they've seen donated to the project all year at $24,146 USD but still just below last year's level.</p>
<p>Giving an update on the status of the upcoming Linux Mint 21.3 release, the Beta phase sounds like it's going well with 50 bug reports being sent in and 35 of them already closed. Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 will also be getting all the improvements from the main Linux Mint 21.3 release.</p>
<p>For the 21.3 EDGE ISO, which they provide for people who have issues booting systems with their main downloads, they will be releasing a 21.3 EDGE ISO with Linux kernel 6.5 as they said "During BETA testing we identified compatibility issues between Linux Mint and new hardware devices (recent AMD graphics but also wireless chipsets and SSD controllers used in Acer laptops). These are solved by upgrading the kernel series from 5.15 to 6.5.".</p>
<p>Since they go by what kernels Ubuntu officially provide, since Mint is based on Ubuntu, they're stuck with whatever the latest Ubuntu provides since Mint don't package up their own kernels.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently on either Steam Deck or desktop Linux?</p>
<p>I am currently going through the original Alan Wake (I have zero idea what's going on…), and after that I plan to finally do a proper Fallout 4 play-through. I decided to actually start going through some of my own library to play through games collecting dust and the Steam Deck is just magic for that.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 hits initial funding goal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team are currently running a <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/plasma6member/" target="_blank">funding campaign</a> to help bring in more monies to support Plasma desktop development, and thankfully well ahead of the Plasma 6 release they've managed to hit the initial goal.</p>
<p>With the first two goals of getting 550 paying members hit, they've managed to pull in a good amount of funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to your generosity, we now have the funds to take on the launch of Plasma 6 and all the challenges that come with it, as well as count on enough funds to commission artwork and designs from professional artists, ensuring new and beautiful wallpapers, websites, logos, and icons for Plasma 6's first year of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they're hoping to add another 100 members as their stretch-goal on their funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our second stretch goal aims to add 100 more members and give us the means to fund the upkeep of all the infrastructure and resources for developers and external communications. This covers a wide range of things, from paying the rent for the servers used for development and internal communication among community members, to designing and maintaining public websites, forums, communication with the media, creating merchandise, promotion at non-FLOSS events, and more. Our deadline for this second stretch goal is the launch date of Plasma 6 on February 28, 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18395821891704289040gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18395821891704289040gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A reminder on the rest of the Plasma 6 roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>

      <title>Linux hits nearly 4% desktop user share on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to Statcounter, which should be taken with a pinch of salt of course like any sampling, the Linux share on the desktop hit nearly 4% in December 2023. Last month was a record too and a clear trend over time, as going back a couple of years, it was rarely coming close to 2% but now it's repeatedly nearing 4% so it's quite a good sign overall.</p>
<p>The latest from Statcounter shows for all of 2023 below:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li>July - 3.12%</li>
<li>August - 3.18%</li>
<li>September - 3.02%</li>
<li>October - 2.92%</li>
<li>November - 3.22%</li>
<li><strong>December - 3.82%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at December it shows Windows rising too, with macOS dropping down. If we actually take ChromeOS directly into the Linux numbers for December 2023 the overall number would actually be 6.24% (ChromeOS is Linux after all).</p>
<p>Here's how just Linux looks over time on Statcounter since early 2009 until now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/996456521704281563gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/996456521704281563gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Seems like a pretty clear trend over time don't you think? Nice to see this happening elsewhere, just like we've seen over years <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/linux-use-on-steam-ends-2023-with-a-multi-year-high-thanks-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with the Steam Survey</a>.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall remake Daggerfall Unity 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another really impressive project that just got a big final release is The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall game engine remake Daggerfall Unity which has hit the 1.0 meaning it's now complete!</p>
<p>With it you get the classic Daggerfall experience plus many enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform without emulation (Windows/Linux/Mac).</li>
<li>Retro graphics are boosted by modern engine and lighting.</li>
<li>High resolution widescreen with classic style.</li>
<li>Optionally play in retro mode 320×200 or 640×400 with VGA palettes.</li>
<li>Optionally overhaul the graphics and gameplay with mods.</li>
<li>Huge draw distances even without mods.</li>
<li>Smooth first-person controls.</li>
<li>Quality of life enhancements.</li>
<li>Extensive mod support with an active creator community.</li>
<li>Translation support via community mods.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does require a copy of the original DOS Daggerfall to run as that provides all necessary game assets such as textures, 3D models, and sound effects. Thankfully it's a free game nowadays, so you can just pinch it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of good mods available for it too like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/5" target="_blank">DREAM</a> that remasters all the game assets including sound, music, videos &amp; all graphics found in the game making it just that little bit more modern:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6404153901704280256gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6404153901704280256gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Note: while the code is open source it does still require the proprietary Unity game engine.</em></p>

      <title>Linux use on Steam ends 2023 with a multi-year high (thanks Steam Deck)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out now for December 2023, and it shows that Linux and Steam Deck overall finished 2023 on a very positive note.</p>
<p>Something I continue showing over time on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, we can see that December 2023 is the highest it's been in multiple years. Only <em>just</em> beating the previous high of July 2023 by 0.01%! This is all largely thanks to Valve's Steam Deck that ships with SteamOS Linux, and Proton that continues to help tens of thousands of games be playable on Linux systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9032671351704217237gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9032671351704217237gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the December 2023 overall operating system results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.40% -0.16%</li>
<li>Linux 1.97% +0.06%</li>
<li>OSX 1.63% +0.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>And just on the Linux side the most popular Linux distributions for gaming on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 40.53% -2.46%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.85% +0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 7.04% +0.37%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.22% +5.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 4.70% +0.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.64% -0.15%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.03% +0.35%</li>
<li>Other 27.99% +1.51%</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that the Steam Deck has been a top seller over the last few weeks too. For the week starting Tuesday, November 14th it went back to 1st place globally on Steam (in supported regions obviously) and remained number 1 until Tuesday, December 19th where it dropped to 2nd place and has remained 2nd the following week up until today. So clearly Valve are still shifting plenty of units.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.11 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear <strong>fheroes2</strong> project supporters and Heroes of Might and Magic II fans!</p>
<p>The team is pleased to present the new version of the fheroes2 engine - <strong><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.11" target="_blank">1.0.11</a></strong> after a month of hard work. As in any other release, we made many changes and are happy to share the news with you.</p>
<p>The "<em><strong>Battle Only</strong></em>" mode has undergone a substantial revamp, boasting an improved user interface and a newfound capability to <strong>save the state of selections</strong> within the dialog. These enhancements promise a more immersive and user-friendly experience for players engaging in battle-centric gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754215341703710487gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754215341703710487gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Continuing our commitment to refining the gaming experience, the <em><strong>AI</strong></em> has received a notable upgrade. The AI makes better decisions during battles while defending its troops.</p>
<p>The work on the <em><strong>Editor</strong></em> continues. The team added <strong>a base file format</strong> for future maps, which will incorporate a greater number of features compared to the original map format.<br/>
Additionally, the Editor has been expanded with <strong>Castle and Town placement logic</strong>, along with the inclusion of <strong>Ocean objects</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4430979271703710487gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4430979271703710487gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The majority of the work focused on modifying the code for the Editor and preparing the game to support the upcoming map format.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8104803321703710486gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8104803321703710486gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In this release, the team also polished multiple places in the <em><strong>UI</strong></em>, such as difficulty selection in campaigns, Tree of Knowledge quick info dialog, making AI heroes' animations depend on their speed, and many more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458767291703710485gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458767291703710485gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall, <strong>more than 30 issues</strong> have been fixed in this release, and many translations have been updated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!<br/>

      <title>Festive Co-Op Games</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:left">Hopefully, like me, you’ll have booked in a bit of premium gaming time around the festive period. And coincidentally, Valve’s Winter Steam Sale kicked off just a couple of days before Christmas. Since so many of us and our friends are off, this marks the perfect time of year to dip your toe into the wonderful world of co-operative games. I have two friends I game with pretty regularly, and as a result, I was surprised to see that my game collection boasts a pretty staggering number of “best played with friends” titles. So I thought I’d share the love, albeit with apologies that the vast bulk of these titles are both Steam-only and non-native.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The only thing I’m going to exclude from this little round up is MMOs. While they often have compelling co-op elements, I’m just not comfortable recommending any of those, given how long I’ve been out of the MMO scene.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I’m also going to focus on “Online Co-Op”, although some of these titles also support split-screen local and Steam Remote Play Together options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><big><strong>Well Known Titles</strong></big></h4>
<p style="text-align:left">Let’s start with some of the better known options. There are honestly too many big names to list, so lets put aside some of the more obvious ones like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/" target="_blank">Terraria</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" target="_blank">Diablo</a> series, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/" target="_blank">Payday 2</a>/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a> and so on, and focus on the quirkier options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Overcooked 2</em></strong> (<s>Proton</s> Native!)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Pure chaos in even just two player mode, this game supports up to four players at once, as you battle to fulfil food orders by chopping ingredients, steaming, frying and boiling, then plating up and serving, then cleaning, all across increasing inventive, often-changing levels. It sounds simple, it starts simple, but over time, the complexity ramps up resulting in an odd combination of pure frustration and chaotic fun. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Spelunky 2</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The original Spelunky is ten years old now and featured local co-op, but when developer Mossmouth released its sequel in 2020, it had online co-op baked in. Up to four players in a rich, procedurally-generated set of challenging biomes. The opportunity for absolute chaos through emergent gameplay makes this one a co-op gem. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/Spelunky_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/spelunky" target="_blank">original is also on GOG</a>, but the follow up never made it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Hammerwatch 2</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">While the original Hammerwatch is still playable and sports a native version, the follow up is a considerable step up in graphics, albeit Windows-only. The combat in this sequel feels much more satisfying and polished, and the game world hints at a much greater depth too. I've not played long yet, but I'm looking forward to more. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538970/Hammerwatch_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, although the original game is available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/hammerwatch" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Remnant: From the Ashes</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A unique FPS, Remnant combines weak-spot shooting with a souls-like dodge-roll mechanic tied to a stamina-gauge and a diverse set of RPG upgrades. Runs are randomised and you could complete the game without unlocking/finding all the weapons on offer, nor the various magical upgrades you can apply to each. Remnant is on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/617290/Remnant_From_the_Ashes/" target="_blank">Steam</a> only. If you enjoy this one, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/Remnant_II/" target="_blank">its sequel</a> is only a few months old.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10037898301703625657gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10037898301703625657gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Warhammer 40000: Darktide</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Developer Fatshark never did get EAC to work reliably in its earlier title, Vermintude 2, so I didn’t have high hopes for Darktide. However, not only is it perfectly playable (including hosting/joining multiplayer), I’m enjoying this far more than I did the fantasy setting of the earlier Vermintude games. Fight for the Emperor as one of four extremely customisable characters classes in multiple L4D2-like mission-based scenarios. If you can look past the obnoxious monetisation model, this is worth a look. It really does a great job of delivering the Warhammer 40K atmosphere with excellent voice acting and brilliantly realised environments. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Gunfire Reborn</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I won’t go into too much detail except to note that this is amongst the greatest co-op roguelite shooters ever made. If you enjoy an FPS and you haven’t played this yet, then you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the two DLC expansion character packs are well worth picking up if you enjoyed the base game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A little rough around the edges, but this gem really captures the vibe from the Aliens movie and shoves it right in your face. With an innovative upgrade system for 7 unique classes, you'll need to find two friends (or the somewhat lacklustre bots) to take down aliens and androids across 12 sprawling missions. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549970/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><strong>Less Well Known</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Inkbound</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">This incredible roguelite from the creators of Monster Train is my current obsession. Despite being turn-based, all players spend their round in real-time which ensures a snappy pace. There are some fantastic synergies to exploit by playing different characters together - group the enemies with the Weaver's "Stitch" skill, pound the grouped enemies with an AoE "Leaping Strike" from the Magma Miner, then pulse an arena-wide "Seismic Slam" taunt as the Obelisk and tank all the resulting counter-attacks on your shields, thereby protecting your allies. Huge meta progression, a subtle (and ignorable if you wish) plot providing world building, and more challenges and missions than you can shake a stick at, this one is highly recommended. Get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062810/Inkbound/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14790961491703635735gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14790961491703635735gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17104611901703635734gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17104611901703635734gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Ember Knights</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A room based roguelite for up to 4 players, you can specialise in any of six unique weapons as you fight and dodge roll your way to the perfect build, choosing from 17 secondary skills and 85 relics as you and your friends progress. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135230/Ember_Knights/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Helldivers</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Do you like accidentally killing your friends? Do you enjoy a brutal challenge of near-never ending enemies? Do you like the stress of tapping button combos to radio-in airstrikes, turrets or mech support? If so, go play Helldivers immediately. There’s a reason this game has a button that simply throws your character on the ground. Keeping track of turret or mech fire while trying to disarm a nuke or prime an energy generator is shockingly difficult. But great fun with up to 4 players. Lots of DLC on this one, but the Digital Deluxe edition packages the game and all DLC for around the price of a pint of lager. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394510/HELLDIVERS_Dive_Harder_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Ravenswatch</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Challenging, satisfying, beautiful. Three words to sum up Passtech’s co-op follow up to Curse of the Dead Gods. Still in development, the first two missions/bosses are complete and will give you around an hour’s play per attempt. The roguelite upgrades in this one will make or break your build across a variety of deeply varied characters as you and up to three friends race against the clock to level up before the boss showdown. Highly recommended, available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2071280/Ravenswatch/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9155036071703626336gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9155036071703626336gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Stolen Realm</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">What’s this? A real-time turn-based RPG looter with accessible-yet-deep character customisation across 9 skill trees. Real-time, but turn-based? Yep it’s turn-based, but up to 6 players all take their turns in real-time, creating either wonderful harmonies, or friend-losing chaos, before ending their segment and letting the enemies take their go. An event system will also drop permanent relics and the developers have recently launched a roguelike-version of the gameplay loop for those players not willing to sink tens of hours into the world-based campaign. Find this gem on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330000/Stolen_Realm/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Spellmasons</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A recent addition to my library, I haven’t delved into this much yet, but basically take Noita’s wand-building and throw it into a turn-based top-down map that sees you constructing clever chained take downs of multiple enemies as you move from map to map, collecting new abilities along the way. This one supports up 8 players which must be absolute chaos. Spellmasons is on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1618380/Spellmasons/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Blackout Protocol</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">With hints of Alien Swarm, Blackout Protocol gives you and up to two more friends the opportunity to choose from a variety of weapons, skills and grenades as you take on its top-down, wonderfully lit, pseudo-3D missions. Early builds were ridiculously challenging, but recent updates have made the game somewhat more accessible. It’s got some nice grindy meta-progression to help out longer-term too. You can grab this one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Blackout_Protocol/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Necesse</em></strong> (Native)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Not one I’ve played a lot of, but from my time in this surprisingly deep world, it’s a curious cross of Terraria-style base-building and Core Keeper dungeon-diving, with a top-down perspective. You can play with up to 4 players as you build a village around your base while hunting for crafting supplies underground. The UI is a little rough around the edges, but it gets regular updates and appears to have something of a cult following, with well over 10 thousand steam reviews, mostly positive. Grab it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Vagante</em></strong> (Native)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Take Spelunky, zoom it out a little, add in RPG-mechanics, focus on combat and hey presto! Vagante has so many Spelunky mechanics, you’ll be right at home switching between them. Cooking chickens for health, spikes that one-shot your character, falling blocks, it’s uncanny. In 50 hours, I’ve never beaten the game, but like Spelunky, it rarely tips over from maddeningly-addictive to actual frustration. Terrible UI, but worth the learning curve as the mechanics are rock solid. Get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/323220/Vagante/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><strong>All the rest</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:left">There are just so many. It feels like online-coop has experienced a real surge in the past few years, possibly powered by Steam’s networking stack, as you can see from how few on this list actually make it to GOG. Here’s a few more games for you to take a look at, if the list above didn’t sate your appetite.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/Gauntlet_Slayer_Edition/" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">Outriders</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512900/Streets_of_Rogue/" target="_blank">Streets of Rogue</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">Don’t Starve Together</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Dying Light</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201540/HELLCARD/" target="_blank">Hellcard</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/" target="_blank">Broforce</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One/" target="_blank">Bounty of One</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/Trine_Enchanted_Edition/" target="_blank">Trine</a> series, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/" target="_blank">Starbound</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649240/Returnal/" target="_blank">Returnal</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/Castle_Crashers/" target="_blank">Castle Crashers</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/465200/Fury_Unleashed/" target="_blank">Fury Unleashed</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a> and pretty much all the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/" target="_blank">Borderlands</a> games.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Steam’s Winter Sale is on until January 4th, so if you fancy anything on this list, check it out before then, as most of these have pretty substantial discounts until then. Happy co-op gaming!</p>

      <title>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's coming up on Christmas now, and so GamingOnLinux will be going into it's usual <em>mostly</em> hibernating state to take a little break to recharge. Apart from any sudden big stories that appear, or just plain boredom from me (or guest contributions), you can expect news to be rather quiet over the next week.</p>
<p>A <strong>big</strong> thank you to all supporters, commenters and readers for an absolute knock-out of a year that smashed through pretty much every record I think we've ever had for everything. It continues to be a real pleasure to run GamingOnLinux and follow how Linux gaming continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Just a reminder that if you wish to support me and GamingOnLinux the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" target="_blank">links are available here any time</a> which includes the affiliate store links to buy games while also supporting GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>GamingOnLinux will return to properly normal operations around January 3rd, 2024.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and have a wonderful and safe New Year celebration!</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Verified picks for the 2023 holiday season</title>

      <title>Godot 4.3 dev 1 brings major rendering changes - plus W4 Games on console support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on Godot Engine have released the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-1/" target="_blank">first snapshot of Godot 4.3</a> which brings with it some big rendering changes that sound quite exciting overall.</p>
<p>According to the post they've done a "Major refactoring of the rendering system (GH-83452), which paves the way to several big improvements coming soon", one of which <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/collaboration-with-google-forge-2023/" target="_blank">linked</a> in the post is a collaboration with Google and The Forge to further improve Vulkan.</p>
<p>There's also now a new Direct3D 12 rendering driver, multiple controllers can now contribute to input actions, node groups can now be configured project-wide, freed objects are now treated differently from null in comparison operators, loading of scenes with corrupted or missing dependencies will no longer be aborted and an infamous bug causing areas to lose signal connections when pausing/unpausing the game has been fixed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Meanwhile W4 Games, the company started up by some of the core Godot team, has <a href="https://w4games.com/2023/12/11/w4-games-announces-pricing-model-for-console-ports/" target="_blank">announced</a> their pricing for console port support for Godot. It's good to see a proper option out there now, as console support for Godot was something of a sore point for developers. The pricing may be a bitter pill to swallow for solo developers considering it's $800 just for a single console up to $2,000 for the big three together (and that's <em>every</em> year too), pricier still if you're a bigger team or if you have a publisher.</p>
<p>They did catch a fair bit of flak for it across social media that I saw, with multiple developers believing such console port support should have come from the Godot Foundation, <em>not</em> a separate company set up specifically to turn a profit like W4 Games (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/w4-games-raises-15m-to-help-push-godot-engine/" target="_blank">who have investors now</a>). These developers mentioned the conflict of interest between the Godot Foundation and W4 Games, considering some people work for both. Various sources of developers not happy with it: <a href="https://twitter.com/pawel_developer/status/1734791483541028954" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/epyoncf/status/1734570315097821377" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottTRichmond/status/1736777179088961913" target="_blank">#3</a> and so on.</p>
<p>For comparison on the pricing (specifically for console support):</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity: minimum $2,040 per-person per-year, plus the Runtime Fee or or 2.5% of your game’s monthly gross revenue when you hit $1,000,000 (USD) gross revenue on a trailing 12 month basis <em>and</em> 1,000,000 lifetime initial engagements.</li>
<li>Game Maker is $800 a year.</li>
<li>Unreal Engine is free until you hit the 5% revenue share (lifetime gross revenue from that product exceeds $1 million USD).</li>
<li>Defold is completely free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worth noting as well of course Godot is open source and no one is forced to use W4 Games, and any other company could make cheaper console ports too.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle 2 gets Steam Deck Verified, plus a big Beta update is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new puzzle game to add to your collection? Good news for you, as The Talos Principle 2 has now been bumped up to Steam Deck Verified status after testing from Valve.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best games of 2023. Much bigger and even more interesting than the first game, with plenty of new puzzle mechanics thrown in giving you a thought-provoking, character-driven interactive story with multiple endings. Initially Valve only gave it a Steam Deck Playable status, but multiple patches later and a re-test and now Valve have given it full seal of Verified approval. Works great on desktop Linux too with Proton 8!</p>
<p>The developers announced the status in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/835960/view/3890611245666460224" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, along with giving details on an opt-in Beta that brings with it numerous enhancements like a benchmark mode, water ripples, extra lore content and various visual fixes, gameplay improvements, bug fixes, improvements to their shader system (including a progress bar for shaders precaching) and much more.</p>

      <title>Check out this great overview of NVK, the open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Faith Ekstrand has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-holiday-update.html" target="_blank">given a holiday update</a> on the state of NVK, the unofficial open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver and how it's coming along that's worth a read as it's all quite exciting.</p>
<p>The progress on it has been quite ridiculous! At the end of 2022 they had a bare-bones Vulkan 1.0 implementation that only ran a few demos. Now a year later, not only does it have support for around 80 Vulkan extensions and major features but it also support nearly everything needed by DXVK and Zink.</p>
<p>How's performance? Ekstrand mentioned now there's "proper power management and performance improvements in NVK" they can hit around 40-60% of NVIDIA's proprietary driver in "several games". Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1736234565428302200" target="_blank">put up a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) recently noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decided to try it.. Hat in Time 1080p, Very High, VSync OFF. NVK is vulkan-nouveau-git gddf2ca4, on kernel 6.7.0-rc5-1-mainline. Blob is 545.29.06. 3995WX+RTX3090. Proton Experimental.<br/>
<br/>
NVK: 210FPS<br/>
Blob: 165FPS<br/>
<br/>
Cpu-bound, but still :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17454386951703169722gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17454386951703169722gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
NVIDIA proprietary driver<br/>
<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19543556121703169720gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19543556121703169720gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
NVK open source driver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's to come in 2024 for the NVK driver? Get it bumped up to Vulkan 1.3 support and eventually pass conformance which should happen in the first part of the year. This involves a rewrite of the pipeline code and implementing the VK_EXT_shader_object extension, which should bring the driver out of Beta so that distributions can ship NVK by default. Sounds like everything it needs will be ready in Linux kernel 6.7 and potentially in the Fedora 40 release.</p>
<p>After that getting everything hooked up to support VKD3D-Proton, more focus on performance. As Ekstrand said "If 2023 was about making games playable, 2024 will be about making games fast.".</p>
<p>And of course more GPU support too as work continues on Maxwell GPUs. Full <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-holiday-update.html" target="_blank">article here</a>.</p>
