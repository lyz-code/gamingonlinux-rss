      <title>Intel announced their Arc B-Series GPUs and XeSS 2, the day after CEO Pat Gelsinger retires</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of a double-whammy this week from Intel. Not only did they announce that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, but they've also now properly revealed their new Arc B-Series GPUs.</p>
<p>News of Gelsinger's retirement was <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-ceo-news-dec-2024.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> by Intel on December 2nd. Intel has named two senior staffers, David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, as interim co-chief executive officers while they search for a new permanent CEO.</p>
<p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.”</p>
<p>As for the new Intel Arc B-Series graphics cards (code-named Battlemage), only two models have been currently announced with the Arc B580 and B570 GPUs. The B580 will get a Limited Edition model and various partner releases from the likes of Acer, ASRock and others starting December 13 from $249. While the B570 will arrive January 16th starting $219.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663127321733255865gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663127321733255865gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Intel said "Compared with the previous generation, the Intel Arc B-Series GPUs offer 70% better performance per Xe-core and 50% more performance per watt. The B580 GPU, when compared to the Intel Arc A750 GPU, is on average 24% faster at 1440p with some games up to 78% faster. When compared to the competition, the Intel Arc B580 GPU offers up to 32% better performance-per-dollar".</p>
<p>This comes along with an announcement of XeSS 2 which now includes three different bits of tech including XeSS Super Resolution, AI-powered XeSS Frame Generation and Xe Low Latency. So they're following in the footsteps of AMD and NVIDIA here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12774276551733255710gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12774276551733255710gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by their press slides games supporting XeSS 2 will including Assassin's Creed Shadows, Harry Potter Quidditch Champions, Robocop Rogue City, Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza, Dying Light 2, F1 24, Ascendant, Marvel Rivals, Killing Floor 3 and Citadels.</p>
<p>See their explainer announcement video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dl81n3ib53Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b7612d4c540158179a7cda917b3e1792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dl81n3ib53Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Be sure to leave a comment on your thoughts. Will you be buying either of the new GPUs?</p>
<p>Hopefully they will work well on Linux. It's likely you'll need a very up to date kernel and Mesa version for them.</p>
<p><em>I'm still not getting Intel press releases, so have reached out again today to see why.</em></p>

      <title>Minecraft Java 1.21.4 &#39;The Garden Awakens&#39; update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have today released Minecraft Java 1.21.4 'The Garden Awakens' update for everyone, bringing with it some fun new toys and a new biome to carefully explore.</p>
<p>In this update you'll find the new Pale Gardens biome which is quite <em>creepy</em>. It's here you'll find the new hostile mob, the Creaking. This strange mob spawns at night in the new biome, and it basically acts like a Weeping Angel from Doctor Who where it won't move if you're looking at it. You'll need to find and destroy a new block, the Creaking Heart, to take it down. Another fun feature of this biome is that ambient sounds come from blocks inside the biome, and any music playing will fade-out when you enter it. Ultra creepy vibes.</p>
<p>There's also numerous new blocks that arrive with it like Pale Oak which comes along with its own Pale Oak Logs that can be crafted into a full woodset including a door, fence, planks, signs and more. There's also the new Eyeblossoms flowers, Pale Moss, Pale Hanging Moss and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0vKS0FOYNok"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8fae765d339f514afde7dd12a9e7dba3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0vKS0FOYNok" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really interesting addition to Minecraft to make exploring the world a bit more exciting. The full changelog can be found on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Minecraft website</a> release page, it's quite long and detailed with lots of smaller changes on top of all the new additions.</p>
<p>You can install and mod Minecraft easily on Linux / Steam Deck with either the <a href="https://modrinth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Modrinth</a> app or the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Prism</a> launcher.</p>

      <title>4X RPG &#39;Heart of the Machine&#39; from Arcen Games (AI War) releases January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcen Games creators of AI War, AI War 2, The Last Federation and other games have announced their new sci-fi 4X RPG Heart of the Machine will launch January 31st, 2025. There's also a new demo available that you can try right now.</p>
<p>More about it: "Heart of the Machine sees players take the role of the world’s first sentient AI, born into a city filled with endless opportunities (and despair). Raise an army of robots to rule by force, become a benevolent machine overlord, or explore a constellation of alternative paths – players must strive to find their place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving (from itself). Whether you rally the underclasses to fight against corporate tyranny, create shell companies and engage in corporate espionage, or just experiment on people to further your goals, the possibilities are endless."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<li>I also created an Async Patched Build for those who prefer using the Async version over the original.</li>
<li>Updated the <code class="inline-code">Logger</code> string in <code class="inline-code">dxvk/src/dxvk/dxvk_instance.cpp</code> and the <code class="inline-code">renderer.drawText</code> string in <code class="inline-code">dxvk/src/dxvk/hud/dxvk_hud_item.cpp</code> to display <strong>"DXVK-Sarek"</strong> instead of <strong>"DXVK"</strong>. This ensures clarity that the build is a custom version and not from the original DXVK repository.
	<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The engine name remains unchanged to preserve compatibility with tools like MangoHUD, which rely on the original <code class="inline-code">DXVK</code> identifier.</li>

      <title>Half-Life 2 co-op mod Synergy upgraded for the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Synergy is a free mod for Half-Life 2 that allows you to play the Half-Life 2 series and many other singleplayer Source Mods cooperatively with friends. It was recently upgraded to support the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/half-life-2-free-to-keep-until-november-18th-episodes-one-two-now-included-with-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first proper update to the mod since 2015, so it's quite a big one. It includes lots of enhancements, including better Steam Deck support! The developers mentioned they've been working on it for a long time, but they released it "sooner than we've planned as to resolve numerous breaking changes from Half-Life 2's recent large update".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19634688841733224478gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all the highlights of what's new and improved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update!</li>
<li>Fixed numerous crashes like the infamous "unconnected" player bug and player models jittering.</li>
<li>Significantly improved overall performance, especially with large player counts.</li>
<li>Rebalanced numerous, rather absurd, map-specific difficulty spikes in the Half-Life 2 campaign.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamVR starting when changing settings.</li>
<li>Initial official native support for Steamdeck (UI still leaves a lot to be desired).</li>
<li>Fixed various HUD issues introduced by Half-Life 2's Steamdeck update.</li>
<li>Official support for Linux Dedicated Servers.
	<ul>
<li>Requires steam client installed (e.g. `sudo apt install steam`).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for saved games.
	<ul>
<li>Host can load a saved game and friends who join will be restored if they were connected at the time of the save.</li>
<li>Works on dedicated servers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various map-specific (EDT) improvements throughout the Half-Life 2 campaigns.</li>
<li>Fixed many level transition issues, particularly on backtracking maps.</li>
<li>Steam Cloud support for settings and saved games.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for dedicated servers.</li>
<li>Steam Rich Presence support.</li>
<li>Enabled spectator mode via console (jointeam 1)</li>
<li>Players will spawn in a vehicle on airboat levels (coast levels TBD).</li>
<li>Vehicles will no longer stop when the game autosaves.</li>
<li>Added more player voice command lines from ep1.</li>
<li>Fixed player viewmodels being invisible under some circumstances.</li>
<li>Optimized networking for some entities like the Airboat.</li>
<li>'Use' key will now go through players to avoid blocking anything.</li>
<li>Removed cheat flag from some useful commands/cvars.</li>
<li>Added game content rating to unblock Synergy in Germany.</li>
<li>Increased maximum player support from 10 to 32.</li>
<li>Other changes lost in time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's next for it? They're working on "automatic networking and Steam friend lobbies" to make it easier to join up with friends without needing port forwarding, which they hope to have "ready in the near future".</p>

      <title>The best Linux distribution for gaming in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a few previous years (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-best-linux-distribution-for-gaming-in-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-best-linux-distros-for-gaming-in-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2</a>), I decided to do a fresh take each time on what the best Linux distribution was for gaming - so I'm back for a 2025 edition of the article that will cause you to tell me how wrong and terrible I am.</p>
<p>What's changed? Well, quite a lot actually. Both previous times I firmly suggested going with plain Ubuntu. However, time moves on, and the software world evolves rather quickly. So I have a new recommendation for you! Why am I even writing this? Sadly, there's <em>still</em> articles out there pushing for tiny completely random fringe distributions and plenty with stupidly outdated and republished information to get to the top of Google.</p>
<p>My current home for a while now, and what I'll recommend you pick up, is <strong><a href="https://kubuntu.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kubuntu</a></strong>. It has all the goodies and support of plain Ubuntu, but with the KDE Plasma desktop environment, which is the same one used on the Steam Deck's Desktop Mode. It has an interface that will be much more familiar to people coming over from Windows, it's more customizable (if you want it) but with a sane default setup that just gets you going quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5826130221733222157gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Kubuntu, Kubuntu 24.04.1, is supported with security and maintenance updates until April 2027. So you can install it and basically forget about it and keep it running and secure for years to come. However, you're likely better off with Kubuntu 24.10 which is more up to date, if you're okay upgrading again when the next version of Kubuntu comes out (Kubuntu 25.04) which is around April 17, 2025. Either way, both work well.</p>
<p>I've been through Fedora, Manjaro, Linux Mint, plain Ubuntu, Arch and many others over the years. No Linux distributions is perfect and they all come with their own set of quirks and problems, just as Windows has its own set of unique issues. To me, Kubuntu just offers the <em>best</em> all around middle-ground of everything you need to get going.</p>
<p>People will argue about Snaps, but for the majority of normal users — it just <em>doesn't</em> matter in the slightest. I use the Spotify, Thunderbird, Telegram and other Snaps and they work <em>great</em> and are kept nicely up to date without me even needing to do anything.</p>
<p>I will suggest though, that you enable Flatpaks from <a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, so you get the best of all worlds and access to even more easily installable packages. It's <a href="https://flathub.org/setup/Kubuntu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">incredibly easy to do</a> as well.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">download Kubuntu from their website</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help and support for Linux and Steam Deck gaming, you can try asking in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forum</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/0rxBtcSOonvGzXr4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>. Don't forget to follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamingonlinux.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> too while you're at it.</p>
<p>Don't agree with me? That's fine! The benefit of Linux is that there's truly no one-size-fits-all. Leave a comment to tell me how wrong I am. <em>You're still wrong if you disagree though.</em></p>

      <title>Prime Gaming December 3rd edition, new titles coming twice this week - lots for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep. This week we get <em>two</em> sets of new games, so there will be another article with the next additions / removals on December 5th too!</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 2024 fundraiser hits the goal - clearly their donation pop-up works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news coming out from camp <a href="https://kde.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KDE</a>, with their yearly fundraiser ongoing and they've managed to smash their original goal.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, KDE developer Carl Schwan <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carl@kde.social/113584216771717051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm so happy to see the big influx of donations to KDE. More than 75 000€ in the last 30 days with 35 000€ in the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is huge. Thank you to everyone who donated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the actual <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">fundraising website</a>, the total is only listed as €34,121 against their original €30,000 goal. But, it seems that's not counting everything. There's also the <a href="https://kde.org/community/donations/previousdonations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">plain donations</a> to keep an eye on too.</p>
<p>There's more details noted in a fresh <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/12/02/i-think-the-donation-notification-works/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Nate Graham that goes over various other details, like how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/kde-plasma-62-adding-a-pop-up-for-donations-plus-they-want-to-make-a-next-generation-kde-os/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new donation request pop-op</a> is clearly working, as it went live on December 1st and this caused donations to <em>surge</em> to where they received "double the prior two months' Paypal donations in a single day".</p>
<p>Thanks to all the donations, KDE e.V. (the non-profit organization that represents the KDE Community), may end up with a balanced budget instead of their predicted "deficit of over €50k in 2024". According to Graham "German nonprofits like KDE e.V. are required to avoid stockpiling money" which is why they run an intentional deficit, so with the funding moving quickly into a positive cashflow they'll end up increasing their expenditure meaning they can hire more people, sponsor more projects and so on.</p>
<p>Really good news, great to see KDE doing well.</p>
<p>Their fundraising website also expanded the list of apps you can "adopt", by donating a specific amount and picking an app you want with a bunch already full but they've recently added more.</p>

      <title>Vulkan API 1.4 released with new required extensions, better 8K rendering</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group have today announced the release of the Vulkan 1.4 API specification, with various changes and improvements for game and application developers.</p>
<p>In the announcement it notes that "Mesa open-source Linux drivers have passed Vulkan 1.4 conformance on AMD, Apple, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm hardware" already. Looking on the conformant <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">driver list</a>, even the Steam Deck is already listed as supporting Vulkan 1.4. On the NVIDIA side, they have a Linux <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.40.81 Vulkan Beta</a> release available with Vulkan 1.4 support.</p>
<p>New features as noted include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/features/latest/features/proposals/VK_VERSION_1_4.html#_streaming_transfers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Streaming Transfers</a>: Vulkan 1.4 imposes new implementation requirements to ensure portable, cross-platform applications can stream large quantities of data to a device while simultaneously rendering at full performance.</li>
<li>Previously optional extensions and features critical to emerging high-performance applications are now mandatory in Vulkan 1.4, ensuring their reliable availability across multiple platforms. These include push descriptors, dynamic rendering local reads, and scalar block layouts.</li>
<li>Maintenance extensions up to and including VK_KHR_maintenance6 are now part of the core Vulkan 1.4 specification.</li>
<li>8K rendering with up to eight separate render targets is now guaranteed to be supported, along with several other limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Vulkan 1.4 is a developer-driven update that enhances Vulkan's value as a stable, reliable framework for creating graphics-intensive applications on any platform,” said Tom Olson, outgoing Vulkan Working Group Chair. “As I step down, I'm proud to see the groundwork we’ve laid through our roadmaps come to fruition. Our roadmap milestone plans have empowered developers with new levels of flexibility and performance, setting Vulkan on a path for continued innovation and broader adoption in the years to come.”</p>
<p>“Vulkan 1.4 is a milestone release that directly brings long-requested features and proven extensions into the core standard. By mandating these capabilities, we are enhancing Vulkan’s flexibility and performance across a wider range of devices, making it easier for developers to create cutting-edge applications with confidence that they will run reliably on any platform," said Ralph Potter, newly elected Vulkan Working Group Chair.</p>

      <title>Motorsport Games delisting all NASCAR games after iRacing license transfer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motorsport Games announced at the end of November, that all NASCAR games will be delisted from stores on December 31st.</p>
<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on X / Twitter the official Motorsport Games account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the NASCAR game community!</p>
<p>From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the <br/>
@NASCARHeat, @NASCARRivals, and @NASCARignition franchises.</p>
<p>Please lookout for various platform promotions this December to complete your NASCAR console game collection while you can!</p>
<p>We sincerely thank our community for the enthusiasm and support you’ve shown for these games over the years and hope you have enjoyed racing with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Back in October 2023, Motorsport Games <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/exclusive-simulation-style-nascar-video-game-license-sold-to-iracing/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sold off</a> the NASCAR Team Properties' (NTP) exclusive license to iRacing. So this is just them cleaning up shop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9369612381733161312gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - NASCAR Heat 5</em></p>
<p>Looking on stores <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/search?search=nascar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/MotorsportGames" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> various games do have a big discount on them. So if you did want to pick some up, now is the time. As usual for delistings, you'll keep your copy for download but no one else will be able to buy them after December 31st, 2024.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

They said "This new element brings unique abilities and over 10 fresh upgrades and Cosmions infused with muddy power". Plus various UI and quality of life improvements to make the game better. A Custom PvP battle mode is coming later too. They have it ready, but there's a technical challenge with IP restrictions they're working around right now.</p>

      <title>Looks like Discord finally fixed Linux screen and audio sharing with Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago in November, it seems I missed a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/155794864305471497/803664113560977429/1311064084740964433" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> from a user in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> server, noting that the Discord developers finally hooked up screen and audio sharing for Linux with Wayland.</p>
<p>Not yet <em>released</em> though, it seems it's only currently available in Discord Canary, their public testing environment, but anyone can download it and try it out. On the stable client, it just mentions that "Sounds may not be available when sharing a screen on your device", but when you use the Discord Canary client you'll actually see the tickbox to share audio on Linux now too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12593113211733158763gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Testing it with a couple community members myself using Discord Canary earlier today and — yep, it works perfectly. They could see my shared window and the audio playing from it. Excellent.</p>
<p>Once it's out in the proper <em>stable</em> Discord client, you and friends will be able to sit and chat with screens (or specific windows) and audio being shared properly on Wayland. Nice. I imagine there's many scenarios where this would be useful, and it's a feature many Linux users have been pestering Discord to sort for a while now with a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360050971374-Linux-Screen-Share-Sound-Support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggestion</a> on it open for 4 years.</p>
<p><em>No word on when it will be in the stable release yet though.</em></p>
<p>You can test it via the experimental Canary client from Flathub using these commands (taken from the <a href="https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.DiscordCanary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>):</p>
<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo<br/>
flatpak install flathub-beta com.discordapp.DiscordCanary<br/>
flatpak override --user --socket=wayland com.discordapp.DiscordCanary<br/>
flatpak run com.discordapp.DiscordCanary</code></p>

      <title>Blizzard are delisting Warcraft I and II from GOG, so GOG adds a special discount and will keep them updated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_orcs_and_humans" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warcraft I</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_2_battlenet_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warcraft II</a> are going to be leaving <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> "at the publisher's request" (Blizzard).</p>
<p>They're set to leave GOG on December 13th, although if you have a copy you'll still be able to download it afterwards. If you want to pick them up, GOG have given a special discount code "MakeWarcraftLiveForever" but that only applies to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the bundle</a> of them together. GOG say it will knock "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP or 8 PLN" off the price.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2141467671733155444gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, GOG announced a promise for their recently announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/gog-launch-their-preservation-program-to-make-games-live-forever-with-a-hundred-classics-being-re-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Preservation Program</a> as they said "Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store.". Nice to see for people who do buy it up before it vanishes.</p>
<p>Why are Blizzard doing this now? They recently released Warcraft I: Remastered and Warcraft II: Remastered, although they're only available on Battlenet.</p>

      <title>Linux share remains above 2% in the November 2024 Steam Survey thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for November 2024. Here's the details from it. The good news, for Linux users, is that Linux remains above 2% again overall.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/linux-hits-exactly-2-user-share-on-the-october-2024-steam-survey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a> Valve actually adjusted the numbers at some point in the month for the languages used on Steam and the Linux distribution list, so the previous article and our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> were corrected with the newer numbers. But the overall platform percentage remained the same.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall platform stats for November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.56% -0.05%</li>
<li>Linux 2.03% +0.03%</li>
<li>macOS 1.41%+0.02%</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like things just going back to normal, with the Simplified Chinese language option continuing to drop for three months in a row which always causes a change in the Linux numbers.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">For just Linux here's the most popular distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo (Steam Deck) 64 bit 36.63% -0.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.16% +0.30%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 4.99% +4.99%</li>

      <title>Proton 9.0-4 Beta updated with more game fixes needing testing on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/huge-new-proton-9-0-4-update-for-steam-deck-linux-now-in-need-of-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I covered the huge Proton 9.0-4 update</a> for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux hitting the Release Candidate stage and there's been a couple of changes.</p>
<p>It's not released for everyone yet as you still need to manually opt into the Beta on Proton 9.0 to test. Valve developers are looking for feedback on any issues that you <em>don't</em> see in the current stable Proton 9.0-3.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Since the initial Beta Valve added / changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>vkd3d-proton update to include a Cyberpunk 2077 performance <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/2215" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regression fix</a>.</li>
<li>The fix for no audio being played while Microsoft Flight Simulator displays developers logos has been <em>removed</em>. It causes regressions with other games when included without some extra work that's Proton Experimental only for now. The fix is still available via Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Fixed Hell Let Loose crashing when joining a server after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Included a DXVK <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/commit/d96fa54080320e9b63227e76124ffa50a927ced2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regression fix</a> for RaceRoom Racing Experience.</li>

<p>A note: before people reading get excited about "NVIDIA Optical Flow API and DLSS 3 Frame Generation" mentioned below, remember Proton is for Desktop Linux as well as Steam Deck. It doesn't mean anything special for Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Another month down and we're closing in on the festive period, so here's a look back at what's been popular on Steam Deck during November 2024.</p>
<p>Not really surprising what's number 1 again here!

<p>I'm guilty for adding to Diablo IV even though I own it on Battlenet. The convenience Steam offers is just so much better than other stores and launchers. I forget to ever look at Battlenet, and having it on Steam makes it one-click on both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking to grab a new game, I've listed some really good <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/best-cheap-steam-deck-linux-games-in-the-steam-autumn-sale-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cheap stuff for Steam Deck in the Steam Autumn Sale</a>.

Differential updates were implemented with a fallback to full downloads and you should definitely check <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/devblog-237/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Week 237 blog entry</a>, subtitle “Airshipper Partial download”.</li>
<li>Ongoing work on glider courses.</li>
<li>A strong disagreement that started with a discussion about instruments and sounds led to a spiralled misunderstanding, misattribution and hurt feelings between long term developers. It is an unfortunate event, but this conflict lead to the creation of a consensus with multiple statements regarding resolution of such situations. Please read the entire content of these tips at the <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/devblog-235/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Week 235 blog entry</a>, subtitle “Helpful tips and things to know for contributors”.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Airshipper server queries:</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge one that deserved its own topic here since it also features an entire <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/query-serverbrowser-announce/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Player counts is a long-requested feature in the server browser section of Airshipper. Now, the query server allows for clients to query status information about servers more easily displaying accurate ping information, player count, version information and global battlemode. There is a bit of manual work required for server owners to enable that on existing servers, and if you own a Veloren server, please check out the following issue on Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/veloren/serverbrowser/-/issues/103" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">List of servers without a query port</a>.</p>

      <title>Project Zomboid set for a massive update that should get a Beta before Christmas</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Zomboid, the highly rated and popular zombie survival game from The Indie Stone, is set to get another truly massive update.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2024/11/whatz-next/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> an unstable Build 42 is planned to arrive before Christmas time, but they will delay it if they need to. However they said "the enjoyment we’re seeing from our testers certainly would seem to suggest that the build will be in a good enough state for wider consumption".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/753386981732884857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Build 42 Unstable is planned to add some great features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An expanded map.</li>
<li>Underground areas.</li>
<li>A new lighting system.</li>
<li>Animal husbandry.</li>
<li>Wild animals.</li>
<li>Expanded lore.</li>
<li>Dynamic music.</li>
<li>Player vocals.</li>
<li>Better UI scaling.</li>
<li>+ much more shown in the image they shared below.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13234583021732884770gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13234583021732884770gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Project Zomboid has now been in Early Access for over 11 years! The Indie Stone have been through some tough times, like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130505000807/https://projectzomboid.com/blog/2011/10/project-zomboid-burglary-statement/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">break-in</a> back in 2011 that resulted in a lot of lost work. Thankfully, the game lived on and became something much-loved by players.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Survival game The Last Plague: Blight adds controller support, great for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last Plague: Blight <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/uncompromising-wilderness-survival-game-the-last-plague-blight-now-in-early-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impressed me quite a lot</a> with the initial Early Access release, and the developer has been doing some great updates to it recently. </p>
<p>With an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1564600/view/4464851103138186304" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">last week</a> adding in experimental controller support (only for third-person right now) it's supported across Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation controllers. Potentially other controllers as well, but only those controller icons are supported so far. The developer went a step further for Steam Deck, to ensure that text input will give you a proper on-screen keyboard too. Also in is a new radial menu for better controller support, replacing the old quick action menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19244298201732880523gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The third-person mode is also a reasonably new experimental addition to the game, giving it quite a different feel to the default top-down view. Feels almost like it was made for it though after giving it a test run today, it works quite nicely with my Xbox controller on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Since the update landed, a few more have arrived, like giving an on-screen keyboard to controllers other than the Steam Deck, along with various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The Last Plague: Blight now has a Very Positive rating on Steam. With Native Linux support, and hopefully Valve will rate it officially for Steam Deck soon now it has controller support built-in.</p>

      <title>Modding support returns to Dome Keeper in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the developers keep working away on multiplayer for Dome Keeper, you can now get back to filling your game up with mods as support has returned.</p>
<p>The game did have it before, but they did a major upgrade of the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> version used with a previous update, which messed with mod support. Now though, it's back and better than ever with numerous mods upgraded for it.</p>
<p>As they explained in the announcement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year we ported Dome Keeper from Godot 3 to Godot 4. Godot is the engine we use. This was a big undertaking done for three reasons, being multiplayer, console ports and future proofing the project. With that switch, the way the game can be modded did change too, and thus most mods broke.<br/>
We hired Ste from our community to lead the effort of making modding work for Godot 4 for Dome keeper. He is a cornerstone of our community and a key person in the Godot modloader project (shoutout to Kana too &lt;3), so in short the perfect fit to champion modding.</p>
<p>The result: modding is back, yay!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iJCV2MjXJYc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13f8ff5cae645b9695bbd08272a316bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iJCV2MjXJYc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To celebrate, a Dome Keeper modding jam is coming in January and they will be giving out some awards for it.</p>
<p>I recently got quite hooked on Dome Keeper. It's a great game and in the blink of an eye quite a few hours vanished from me. Woops.</p>
<p>Also a great time to mention you can get Dome Keeper and more games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-raw-fury-humble-bundle-is-an-awesome-deal-with-11-steam-deck-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the latest Humble Bundle</a>!</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will get cross-play, a photo mode and 12 subclasses next year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best RPGs ever made is about to get even better, with Larian Studios announcing what looks to be the last major update for Baldur's Gate 3 coming in 2025.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers mentioned we're going to be getting cross-play so you can finally hook up with friends across PC and console. This also includes cross-progression too using the Larian Network.</p>
<p>You might also want to do a fresh play-through as they're also adding in one new subclass for each of the existing Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard classes in the game. This will come with "new abilities, animations, VFX, summons and cantrips, and unique voiced dialogue lines for the Oathbreaker Knight with written reactivity for Oathbreakers, along with a touch of homebrewing on certain actions to enhance your role-playing experience".</p>
<p>I love the idea of the Ranger - Swarmkeeper subclass, giving you three types of deadly swarms to assist you in combat. Or the Barbarian - Path of Giants subclass to give you more power to launch people around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8496320361732878818gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>That sounds pretty exciting actually!</p>
<p>On top of that, there's going to be a proper photo mode to capture those great moments with a whole bunch of options to tweak the camera to your liking. This includes post-processing effects, photo frames, camera angle, what character to focus on, stickers and more.</p>
<p>A stress-test Beta will begin in early January for players to try it out and report any issues.</p>

      <title>Latin cowboy casual farming sim Gaucho and the Grassland new demo released</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>​Gaucho and the Grassland is a game that depicts the life of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucho" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gaúcho</a>, the equivalent of a Latin Cowboy from the region of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampas" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Pampas</a> (South of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile).</p>
<p>The full game is set to be released in Feb 2025, and this is the official trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1ysjZ8aDtn0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6eaa170002d04a13a21c5731f32abcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1ysjZ8aDtn0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Grassland is a place that not only brings you adventures related to daily duties like taking care of the cattle, helping locals, harvesting and resource gathering much like Stardew Valley, but also has some folkloric elements like "Boitatá the fire snake" which corrupts environments as it passes and the "Velho Pai (Old Father)", an Elderly Gaúcho that helps you with general guidance throughout the game.</p>
<p>The demo provided back at the end of 2022 was not that great. Controllers were bad, camera was awkward, mounting the horse was not really enjoyable because the map was tiny, the dog digging items mechanic was awful. However, after playing 3 hours in a chilled exploring mode in the brand new demo, these are my impressions so far:</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Game is more polite with more textures, a better night and day cycle, dynamically moving NPCs, item trading with NPCs, and there is actually an earth curvature while you explore the island.</li>
<li>A significant amount of content was added if compared with the old demo. </li>
<li>There is kind of a tutorial which is gameplay driven that let's you freely explore the map while learning the game mechanics.</li>
<li>I've played in Portuguese and English and I think the linguistic regionalism that is a characteristic of the Pampas is well translated or good equivalents are being used for the written dialogs.</li>
<li>For those born in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Rio Grande do Sul</a> state like me (Gaúcho), there are plenty of cultural references like when you complete a quest and a sample of the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDn3lLEQTD0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Canto Alegretense</a>" song is played, which is culturally relevant and an informal anthem of that state.</li>
<li>Quest system looks fun, and while there is a main quest that bounds all the situations that the NPCs are facing, the side quests help you to understand the mechanics and provide you with new items or recipes. The fact of not having all recipes available and you need to do good deeds to other NPCs to unlock them is cool.</li>
<li>Controllers are really good movement wise and using keyboard + mouse or my 8BitDo as a Steam managed controller worked out of the box except in specific situations (see below).</li>
<li>The Dog mechanic got way better since now the spots where the dog needs to dig are visible, making it easier to spot where you can collect materials instead of relying solely on the game RNG.</li>
<li>The house building and house decoration mechanics are nice and trigger a comfy feeling.</li>
<li>Game has a lot of potential from exploring, collecting, crafting, house building, decoration and puzzle solving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game still needs some optimization. When you start to move around on the map FPS can decrease drastically. In my case with a RTX3070 (laptop) I saw going from 144 to 68, and eventually a dip to 40 FPS.</li>
<li>The game does not have an autosave feature, which is unusual for this kind of exploration game. What happened is that when I was returning some items to end a quest, the NPC was floating(picture below). When I tried to report a bug by pressing F1 the game completely crashed.</li>
<li>When entering build mode to create my first house on the first acquired piece of land, I had to use the mouse to first select the item. After that, I was able to navigate through the building process but it seems that right after you enter build mode, the left thumbstick is useless and the first interaction needs to be done with the mouse. For those using controllers only or movement impaired players with special gamepad setup this could be a problem.</li>
<li>Menus are awkward to navigate with a controller and the game does not  have have a HUD scale setting.</li>
<li>Inventory and crafting uses the same overlay of the main menu, which kinda leads you to the same screen overall if you press Start or Y but on a different tab. On crafting games, I'd expect that you can still observe your environment while crafting and organising your inventory.</li>
<li>Quest tracking only shows one quest per time, and you need to go all over through menus to change the quest you want to track. </li>
<li>Playing on keyboard + mouse is good but the default controller layout needs to be worked a little bit. I’ve got confused many times because LB is “call the dog” and RB is “call the horse” when usually in these games genre it is used for item access on your belt. When I wanted to switch items(which are mapped to Dpad R and Dpad L) I got myself calling my dog or horse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ugly (depends on your opinion)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The expressions used by the main character when doing routine stuff are typically gaúcho regionalisms. While those phrases are catchy for those who understand, may annoy "non south Brazilians" because of the repetition. IMHO, it is stereotypically accurate and non-offensive for those from that region, and I feel like using "Texan accent" audio as a substitution because of the cowboy-ish theme would be bad.</li>
<li>The game received some Rio Grande do Sul state<a href="https://www.procultura.rs.gov.br/ver_projeto_fac.php?cod=4614" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> government subsidy</a> and funding since it portrays the life of the ones who are cowboys in the countryside. This item is on this section because people's opinions can differ much on this matter.</li>
<li>There is no mini-game for fishing which turns it into a boring task if compared with similar game titles. Fishing animation takes a lot of time making it not enjoyable for those who want to grind materials as well, and fells really slow if compared with other gathering mechanics.</li>
<li>While the day and night cycle mechanic is good, the day cycle could be longer proportionately in minutes since during the night most of the NPCs are unreachable.</li>
<li>The previous demo didn’t have a progression system for your actions, and after chopping some wood I noticed that my “Axe Skill” increased by 1, leading to an extra drop rate. After that, the same happened for mining and I don’t know if keeping this progression hidden is by design but, it would be nice to see some progression bars like Valheim.</li>
<li>The Linux demo build is still the one from 2022. I was scratching my head because the old grass bug was still there, and nothing had changed. When I forced the use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for that title, the new demo was provided. I don’t think it is that bad not providing a Native Linux build, but shaders being compiled during the gameplay could be the cause of performance dips although I saw some Brazilian YouTubers playing natively on Windows having those same performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some screenshots I took during my gameplay yesterday:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3088592121732877244gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3088592121732877244gol1.jpg"/></a><em>A reference to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins_of_S%C3%A3o_Miguel_das_Miss%C3%B5es" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Ruins of São Miguel Unesco</a> World Heritage site.</em></p>

<em>The bug that crashed my game and made me lose 20 minutes of progress</em></p>
<p>The game has incredible potential, if the issues get solved and also because of the fact that you are on an island and navigating out of it could lead to some future DLCs or extra content. I’m giving the benefit of doubt here since other titles of this genre suffered from the same performance issues and got better after some updates.</p>
<p>I tried to be as neutral as possible on my opinions even being a Gaúcho myself.</p>
<p>For those interested, you can<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1670830/Gaucho_and_the_Grassland/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> follow on Steam</a> and download the demo.</p>
<p>Make sure to force the use of the Steam Play <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility tool as highlighted above, as the Native Linux demo is old. I've let the developer know about this. It has Linux in the system requirements, so as far as we know the main release will have Linux support.</p>

      <title>LIGHT OF MOTIRAM takes Horizon Zero Dawn and turns it into a co-op survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is this Palworld all over again? The copying here is pretty blatant. Tencent Games owned developer Polaris Quest revealed LIGHT OF MOTIRAM and it seems very familiar.</p>
<p>Picture this: you run around with a bow and arrow, or a spear, and come across various mechanical beasts that freely roam the world. You've heard that before right? Because that's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West. But actually, it's <em>not</em>, it's LIGHT OF MOTIRAM.</p>
<p>Much like Palworld though, this adds quite a lot to the basic idea. There's online co-op for up to 10 people, 100 different Mechanimals to tame, ride, customize and take into combat with you. A full building system that has "realistic physics" with crafting, making it more of a traditional open-world survival game. Even so, their inspiration is truly obvious. The combat looks a fair bit more like Monster Hunter though, which is interesting. It's just the overall design work is <em>very</em> Horizon looking.</p>
<p>See their first teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hAhp1uJpSDc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdc27407133e388f81182c4f3a70f51e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hAhp1uJpSDc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I must admit, I do love the look and sound of this one.</p>

      <title>We&#39;re getting a Palworld x Terraria crossover, major Palworld update in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a surprise this one. Palworld and Terraria are getting a crossover, but we don't really know what just yet.</p>
<p>When Terraria did this with previous games, both games were updated with some content inspired by the other game. So it's likely each game will add something from the other, which could be quite interesting. Imagine the Eye of Cthulhu from Terraria flying at you in Palworld — and you try to catch it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18355469481732791606gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Spotted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buckycm.bsky.social/post/3lbvbfszals2f" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> that was posted by their community manager Bucky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...</p>
<p>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!</p>
<p>! ! ! Palworld x Terraria ! ! !</p>
<p>More info coming soon!</p>

<p>For Palworld, we're also getting the next major update in December as also posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buckycm.bsky.social/post/3lbxrb734ic25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> noting it comes with the new island that's "SIX TIMES BIGGER than Sakurajima will be your greatest challenge yet".</p>

      <title>The new Nexus Mods open source cross-platform app adds Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nexus Mods keep expanding their very promising cross-platform open source app for modding, that will eventually replace their older apps and the new 0.7.0 release just went out.</p>
<p>This expands the game support with Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, on top of the already supported Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. The developers mentioned: "This version adds basic support for Bannerlord. All modules can be easily installed and managed. We've also added several advanced <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/Bannerlord/#loadout-health-check" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Health Check diagnostics</a> to allow players to understand common issues in their setup, with more planned for the future when we add load order support!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6681662731732790238gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em></p>
<p>The Collections download page has been further refined, now giving non-Premium users access to the Collections features.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">An additional experimental update for Cyberpunk 2077 modding support was added with REDmod load order support. They've also added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3: Added <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/BaldursGate3/#loadout-health-check" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">diagnostics</a> relating to BG3 Script Extender.</li>
<li>Updated the My Games page design to better showcase the games you have managed, detected and available in the app but not detected.</li>
<li>Updated the design of tabs in the Workspace system to make them more compact.</li>
<li>General polish to areas of the UI such as Health Check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great stuff. Looking forward to seeing the full release of the Nexus Mods app since it supports Linux and Steam Deck making modding easier for everyone.</p>

      <title>You can get a free copy of both Breathedge and Dark Sector right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of more games and perhaps you can't afford something from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/gogs-black-friday-sale-is-live-now-with-some-big-discounts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG Sale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-autumn-sale-is-live-for-you-to-empty-your-wallets-steam-awards-open-for-nominations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Sale</a> - you're in luck! Here's two free games you can get right now. Both of which are free to keeps!</p>
<p>The first is <strong>Breathedge</strong>, an ironic outer space survival adventure game. Take on the role of a simple guy called the Man who is just carrying his grandpa's ashes to a galactic funeral and suddenly finds himself in the middle of a universal conspiracy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q3TvkZ9vemA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6a3648a67e275a76b3644f9979ee5d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q3TvkZ9vemA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can grab it from <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/breathedge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> for the next two days. However to claim it you need to sign up to their newsletter and link a Steam account. You've got two days to claim it. As a bonus Fanatical will give you 10% off their <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/birthday-mystery-bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Birthday Mystery Bundle</a> until December 19th 2024.</p>
<p>The other one is <strong>Dark Sector</strong>, that thrusts you into the role of Hayden Tenno, a covert operative sent on a dangerous mission into Lasria, an Eastern European city on the brink of ruin that hides a deadly Cold War secret. You end up being affected by some creature, and eventually get some pretty interesting powers.</p>

      <title>Incredible retro FPS Selaco adds a new &#39;Special Campaign&#39; in another huge update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celebrating six months since the intial Early Access release, the awesome retro-fuelled Selaco has another really big update out now. It's actually kind of ridiculous how much they keep squishing into the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This follows on from a recent Beta, but now it's available to everyone. The major addition is the new Special Campaign mod which is a blend of "New Game Plus and Randomizer Mode" adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A fully customizable campaign experience.</li>
<li>ARPG-style rarity system for both enemies and weapons.</li>
<li>Weapon Trait system where weapons can have new effects and behaviors.</li>
<li>Random Encounter system where new enemies can spawn into the level in real-time.</li>
<li>New unique enemy variants of existing enemies.</li>
<li>Randomization options including shuffled pickup locations, randomized weapon spawns, mystery boxes, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By itself that would be an awesome update but there's a whole lot more to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5787550231732787382gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Altered Orbit Studios also added in support for Steam Cloud, Geforce NOW, smarter tutorial prompts, reworked headshots, improved visuals, improved gun sound effects, more upgrades, improvements to the gore system, melee improvements, enemies will react to getting shot in the legs now, save game protection, new mutators to try and much more.</p>
<p>Due to how big the update is they've moved more story content to sometime in January - February 2025, with Chapter 2 development continuing "rapdily". They gave some teaser info about Chapter 2 including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One of the levels takes place in a mansion.</li>
<li>New defensive items, including a deployable Mini-Turret which comes with its own upgrade tree.</li>
<li>Heavy Weapons. These weapons are extremely powerful, but cannot be stored in your inventory and are thrown away once depleted.</li>
<li>Enemy Miniguns can be picked up.</li>
<li>Drop Pods that can result in unexpected encounters when venturing outside.</li>
<li>Friendly NPC's.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big milestone has been reached by Valve with their handheld Linux gaming PC, with the Steam Deck hitting 17,000 games rated playable or verified.</p>
<p>If you're curious on how long it's taken to hit various milestones Valve hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 in January</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14,000 in March</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-hits-15000-games-rated-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 in May</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-deck-reaches-over-16000-playable-and-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 in August</a>.

<p class="plain-list-title">Some fun games that recently got <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified include:</p>

<em>Pictured - Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></p>
<p>Some other games are easier to play now too like Marvel’s Midnight Suns, since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/2k-launcher-is-finally-no-more-thats-at-least-one-publisher-making-things-better-for-gamers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2K Launcher is finally no more</a>! We also only just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-fixes-disgaea-4-complete-final-fantasy-xiv-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had another Proton Experimental upgrade</a> to bring more compatibility as well. Plus a stable update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/huge-new-proton-9-0-4-update-for-steam-deck-linux-now-in-need-of-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4 is now in testing</a> too! Things are always moving to get as many games working as possible.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">I've been covering various games that get Steam Deck Verified across different articles so if you want some more highlights here's a few to check back on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-verified-highlights-for-november-7-2024-including-planet-coaster-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified highlights for November 7 2024</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There's a lot of games you can play outside of Steam too, although they do need a little extra setup. Like GOG, Epic Games and more via tools like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>. Remember that Valve's numbers here only include what they've put through testing, and only on Steam — so the overall real number is far higher.</p>
<p>Are you curious to know what games with anti-cheat are playable? I'm currently building up our own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated curated list</a> on that to help you. See more details in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/6277/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my forum post</a> (please leave all comments on that in there).</p>

      <title>Steam Autumn Sale is live for you to empty your wallets, Steam Awards open for nominations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another year coming to a close and so the Steam Autumn Sale is live again until December 4. Time to find where your wallet is hiding.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you <em>have</em> to buy anything though. Like me, many of you probably have a few hundred games gathering dust, waiting for that rainy day where you keep promising you'll play with them right? But, a few more couldn't hurt. <em>Some of the deals sure do look delicious.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JC876LwJ2AQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a85fd94f4c2347de237d5561a93eb13f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JC876LwJ2AQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So many thousands of great games on sale, you really don't need any reccomendations from me do you? Oh, you do? Well here's a few favourites going cheaper that work on Steam Deck / Linux Desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222140/Detroit_Become_Human" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Detroit: Become Human</a> - 70% off</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valheim </a>- 50% off</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve also put up the 64GB (EU 15% off) and 512GB (US/Canada 25% off) Steam Deck models on sale, in regions where they still have stock. These are the models that have been discontinued.</p>
<p>This is a great time to give over some suggestions to your fellow GamingOnLinux readers. Drop a comment of your top 5 games on sale you think people should be picking up.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>.</p>
<p>You can also now nominate your favourite games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/nominations" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Steam Awards</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going to wait a bit, the Steam Winter Sale will start December 19th. So even if you miss something in this sale it won't be long for the next major sale.</p>

      <title>New Steam Controller 2 and VR controller designs got leaked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve did a bit of a woops here, as they recently accidentally leaked the designs for what looks like their upcoming Steam Controller 2 and a new VR controller that is likely to come with the long leaked Deckard VR headset.</p>
<p>This is all speculation as always from leaks, as what we've seen might not even get released. As we saw from the Steam Deck, Valve go through a lot of iterations on their hardware before release.</p>
<p>Spotted by SteamDB developer Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbv5dzg5fc2o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the newer Steam Controller 2 looks like everything I wanted. Here's a slightly upscaled version of what they found for what's code-named Ibex.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7591896621732710513gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Looks rather nice, and I'm really happy to see dual thumbsticks and thumbpads, much more like the Steam Deck. Clearly Valve have taken notes about how much people love the inputs on the Steam Deck. My only concern there is how thick it looks, so it will be very interesting to eventually get my hands on it to see how it feels.</p>
<p>According to Djundik on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbv5gkx2qk2l" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, here's how the leak happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way it leaked is funny, [they] put "freetodownload" on the SteamVR app for anonymous accounts to access, which made all the depots accessible, and one of the depots was the contents for deckard/roy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Will you buy one?</p>

<p>This pulls in a lot of improvements from recent updates to Proton Experimental, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-fixes-disgaea-4-complete-final-fantasy-xiv-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve constantly update</a> or Proton Hotfix for specific games.

<p>For giving feedback, Valve ask to report issues that are new to this specific 9.0-4 Release Candidate that you <em>don't</em> see in Proton 9.0-3.</p>
<p>How to access it? Find Proton 9 in your Steam Library, go into the Properties -&gt; Betas and select "release-candidate". Then let it update and away you go.</p>

      <title>TRX an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 keeps expanding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally two separate projects, the open source reimplementations of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 now live under one roof with the TRX project. They're still having distinct individual releases though.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 1 is fully playable, with Tomb Raider 2 in progress and not ready yet. Tomb Raider 1 is supported across Linux, macOS and Windows but Tomb Raider 2 only for Windows right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9304304261732630857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/tomb-raider-1-open-source-engine-tr1x-adds-a-60fps-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last writing about the project</a> there's been some pretty big updates adding in the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to pause during cutscenes.</li>
<li>A photo mode.</li>
<li>An option to toggle the in-game UI.</li>
<li>An option to use PS1 tinted savegame crystals</li>
<li>Added skybox support, with a default option provided for Lost Valley, Colosseum and Obelisk of Khamoon.</li>
<li>Tons of bug fixes.</li>
<li>Various performance and loading time improvements.</li>
<li>Improved custom level support.</li>
<li>Updated OpenGL backend to use version 3.3, with fallback to 2.1 if initialization fails.</li>
<li>Optional automatic key/puzzle inventory item pre-selection.</li>
<li>Ability to disable saves completely by setting the save slot to 0.</li>
<li>+ much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just for Tomb Raider 1, there's been a lot of ongoing work to get Tomb Raider 2 properly playable too.</p>
<p>While the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection does exist, this project works with the originals and enhances them. You can grab them from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess hits a big milestone with over 500,000 copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the big free The Pristine Cut upgrade, Slay the Princess from Black Tabby Games continues to do really well.</p>
<p>Probably one of the best modern visual novels around with its mixture of great writing and lovely artwork. You can read some thoughts from a contributor on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/slay-the-princess-review-as-pristine-as-the-blade-cuts-deep/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pristine Cut in a previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1989270/view/4489620901087674399" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned: "We're beyond thrilled to announce that Slay the Princess has sold over 500,000 copies globally across PC, Mac, Linux, and consoles! It's been one of the greatest experiences of our lives watching so many of you connect with this passion project, and every step of the way you've helped our work exceed even our wildest expectations."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17615634991732628531gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fully voice-acted by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
<li>Hand-penciled art - every background and sprite is drawn traditionally with pencil and paper by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</li>
<li>A princess. She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li>No, the Princess isn't a “cosmic horror,” whatever that is supposed to mean. She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li>Don't even think about trying to romance her. It won't end well for you.</li>
<li>Hopefully you won't die. But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>A branching narrative where what you say and what you believe determines both who you are and how the story unfolds. Though I wouldn’t recommend taking any paths outside of the one I lay before you.</li>
<li>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of Scarlet Hollow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great to see games of all kinds managing to actually sell. In the announcement the developer also mentioned their other game, Scarlet Hollow, will get an update for the first four episodes early next year and then episode five will release later in 2025.</p>

      <title>Dev of Proton Sarek for older GPUs has forked DXVK to backport game settings and improve compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of the interesting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/check-out-proton-sarek-if-you-have-an-older-gpu-for-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Sarek</a> project to help Linux gamers with older GPUs play more games has now <a href="https://github.com/pythonlover02/DXVK-Sarek" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forked DXVK</a>, to hopefully improve things even further.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This repository was created to support users with Vulkan capable GPUs that do not meet the 1.3 requirement of the current builds. My goal is to ensure that everyone can benefit from the nice performance of DXVK, even if their hardware is slightly older.</p>
<p>Additionally, this project is intended to be integrated into <a href="https://github.com/pythonlover02/Proton-Sarek" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton Sarek</a>. The main idea is to backport Quality of Life (QOL) patches and per game configurations from the latest versions to the 1.10.x branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email, the developer told me "I've already backported and updated around 40 per game configurations, and a release should be available soon, around the start to mid December. This release will support both a standard DXVK and an Async version, with both integrated under Proton-Sarek."</p>
<p>Nice to see. While Valve continue pushing their official Proton forward, it often needs the most up to date drivers and the latest Vulkan support. So those of you with older GPUs can still benefit from getting a better experience and not being left behind thanks to Proton Sarek.</p>

      <title>Action-platformer metroidvania Janosik 2 will be a &#39;bigger, bolder adventure&#39; launching December 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free to play Janosik just got a major update, and its bigger, bolder adventure sequel Janosik 2 is set for launch on December 9. The first game is quite popular with a Very Positive rating on Steam, and this sequel looks like it expands on everything from the first.</p>
<p>If you've not played the original, now is a great time, as they've updated the free game with 4 new outfits for Janosik that you can unlock by completing 4 entirely new dungeons.</p>
<p>As for Janosik 2 the developers mentioned it's a "bigger, bolder adventure you don’t want to miss" with four unique playable characters. It takes off directly after the events of the original too. As they said: "Tricked by an ingenious ruse, Janosik must find a way to escape captivity and take the fight directly to Countess Bathory, who thinks she is pulling all the strings in the Highlands. Joined by Bogdan the Werewolf and Hugo the Vampire, and Janka the Plucky Maiden traverse through massive levels filled with mythical foes, deadly traps, and pesky De Blonde's goons."</p>

<p>They both have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fun one with Janosik 2 having multiple endings, various cut-scenes, four playable characters, various new enemies and environmental threats and new traversal options.</p>

      <title>PlaytronOS Alpha 2 brings expanded NVIDIA support, more handheld PC support and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playtron continue building up their PlaytronOS / GameOS (they don't seem to have settled properly on a name yet) alternative to SteamOS and Windows with a second Alpha release out now.</p>
<p>If you're just joining us and have no idea what PlaytronOS actually is. It's a Linux-powered distribution (specifically it's based on the Fedora Silverblue family of Atomic Desktop distros) that aims to play games from Steam, Epic Games, GOG and other platforms out of the box with a sleek interface and everything built-in so you don't need any external launchers. A good idea for handhelds, and they will support desktops and other devices too.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Hardware Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA support for Turing (GeForce GTX 1600/2000 series) and newer cards</li>
<li>Support for dual-GPU systems such as desktops and laptops</li>
<li>OS upgrade from Fedora 40 to Fedora 41</li>
<li>Support for portal-based Wi-Fi connections</li>
<li>These devices have been tested by Playtron and are known to work:
	<ul>
<li>AYANEO 2 and 2S</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally</li>
<li>Lenovo Legion Go</li>
<li>Valve Steam Deck LCD (NVMe only)</li>
<li>Valve Steam Deck OLED</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New &amp; Updated Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full cloud save support with conflict resolution for Epic Games Store and GOG.com games</li>
<li>App details page with game metadata and actions</li>
<li>Full support for mouse and keyboard input</li>
<li>New sound effects</li>
<li>Basic avatar system</li>
<li>Select custom game input configurations some text
	<ul>
<li>A limited selection of inputs are provided by the Playtron team as part of the Alpha 2 launch</li>
<li>Input configuration creation will be one of the features of our upcoming tool Playtron Labs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Timezone support</li>
<li>Up to 2x battery usage improvement in OS</li>
<li>Over 100 bugs identified and fixed</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm keen to see where they go with it, but they need to settle on a name properly and stop flip-flopping between PlaytronOS and GameOS whenever they talk about it. That, and their earlier marketing was quite silly, but they do seem to have cleaned up their website quite a lot. My other concern is how locked down they will keep it, as per their FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first, only the operating system code will be open source. We have plans to open source more and release API documentation to allow developers in the community to contribute and build their solutions using Playtron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's Linux, it will have all the same anti-cheat problems that SteamOS has on Steam Deck too. They still say they're "working with interested partners to enable anti-cheat services" but until they have a proper release with more hardware, I don't see anything changing there. Valve have sold multiple millions of Steam Decks now, and we still see companies newly blocking it like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>. <em>You can keep up to date on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our new anti-cheat page</a> (more info in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/6277/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my forum post</a>).</em></p>
<p>The only device that has been announced with it so far is still the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weird SuiPlay0X1</a>, a $599 handheld from a web3 / blockchain company that talks about NFTs and crypto.</p>
<p>You can download Alpha 2 from <a href="https://www.playtron.one/playtron-os" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>2K Launcher is finally no more - that&#39;s at least one publisher making things better for gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K Games have officially nuked the 2K Launcher from orbit, finally removing it from their games across both Steam and Epic. One publisher at least making things smoother for us all, and even better on Steam Deck since these extra launchers tend to be quite a nuisance.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated post</a> on their official support page they noted that "As of November 18, 2024, the 2K Launcher has been removed from every game that used it on". Yesterday, November 25, a "follow-up update was sent out via Steam to make sure the 2K Launcher was fully removed".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">These games now just launch completely direct into the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bioshock Remastered</li>
<li>Bioshock 2 Remastered</li>
<li>Bioshock Infinite</li>
<li>The Quarry</li>
<li>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">However, these below have a few different launch options, but these are direct Steam launch options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Civilization VI</li>
<li>Civilization V</li>
<li>XCOM 2</li>
<li>XCOM: Chimera Squad</li>
</ul>
<p>2K noted the new XCOM 2 Mod Launcher has also been tested working on Steam Deck, but certain buttons don't work with the gamepad controls so you'll need to adjust Steam Input for it. XCOM: Chimera Squad also has a Mod Launcher, which they said has the same issue but additionally on Steam Deck the Play and Manage Mods buttons have some graphical issues but still function.</p>
<p>You may need to completely close and re-open Steam to see the new launch options for each game.</p>
<p><em>What a lovely thing to wake up to.</em></p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core teaser trailer has me excited for more rock and stone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic is a truly <em>excellent</em> online co-op game, one of the best in fact. Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core takes all the cool bits of it and turns it into a rogue-lite.</p>
<p>To step back a hot second: Deep Rock Galactic has you and a few friends pick a <em>specific</em> type of mission, gear up and then jump into a pod that drills into the planet Hoxxes IV with fully destructible environments, and lots of aliens to squash. Your character gets upgraded outside each mission, to get access to various different tools and weaponry. So you go in fully equipped for the mission you've selected with your chosen character class.</p>
<p>With Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core instead of that defined mission structure and fully equipped space dwarves, it's a lot more random, and more fast-paced. You and your friends start missions with basically nothing, and upgrade as you go through the run gaining new equipment and abilities, making a new character build each time you go through. Plus some meta-progression on top of that.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VXnK8YrWdA0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d06870b35ae0bbb47ae65db97f5e767.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VXnK8YrWdA0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like some fun lore behind it too. in Rogue Core, you're an elite Reclaimer, the ones sent in when the miners can't handle the job as you fight through facilities that were previously set up by the Deep Rock Galactic company.</p>
<p>Many have asked and wondered why this isn't an expansion to DRG, and the developers answered in a detailed post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2605790/view/4482865501645572470" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It started out as an expansion. But as we got deeper into working on it, we found that we wanted to do a lot of stuff that felt way beyond the theme and feel of DRG. In other words, we felt more creative and excited when we didn’t have to keep making sure every idea for Rogue Core fit with the DRG legacy. Another big factor was Early Access – that’s a big way for us to get community feedback and fine-tune everything, and you can’t do that with DLC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt it will play well on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Perhaps even Steam Deck too if the requirements are close enough to the original Deep Rock Galactic. The game is a while away though, not likely until Q4 2025.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental for Steam Deck / Linux fixes Disgaea 4 Complete+, Final Fantasy XIV and various other games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated Proton Experimental, the testing-ground for new features and fixes for their Windows compatibility layer for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Here's what's new for November 25th.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as now playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disgaea 4 Complete+</li>
<li>Soul Interface</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some regressions introduced in previous Proton Experimental updates were solved including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall Guys is playable again.</li>
<li>It's possible to interact with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout: New Vegas launchers using mouse.</li>
<li>Videos play correctly again in Resident Evil 7 Biohazard and Resident Evil Village.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Regressions since Proton 9.0 solved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Games now launch on the correct screen on setups with multiple monitors connected to multiple GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other bug fixes:</p>

<li>Fixed various crashes affecting Final Fantasy XIV launcher.</li>
<li>Fixed broken account creation in Final Fantasy XIV.</li>
<li>Fixed Chromacell not being playable on AMD GPUs.</li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5113070401732551675gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Final Fantasy XIV</em></p>
<p>From the changelog on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have Proton Experimental downloaded, it will show up in your Steam Downloads as needing an update. Otherwise, you can just search for it in your Steam Library to install it. Learn more in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A quick note as well: recently I noticed <em>various</em> other news websites suddenly covering the NVIDIA DLSS 3 update in Proton Experimental that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-adds-dlss-3-frame-generation-support-plus-fixes-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-rivals-of-aether-ii-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I covered nearly two weeks ago</a>. One generic PC site covered it, then another and then another…and so on, sourcing each other. Many making claims of a Steam Deck 2 in some form.</p>
<p>Some writers seem to be mixing up (either for clickbait or they're just confused), that Proton is somehow tied to SteamOS or the Steam Deck, but remember - we all use it on Desktop Linux too. Not everything is directly Steam Deck related at all. Plus, you can bet the Steam Deck 2 <em>if</em> it ever releases <em>will</em> continue to be using an AMD APU. I'll eat my current Steam Deck if Valve went with Intel or NVIDIA. <em>Don't hold me to that.</em></p>

      <title>Unrailed 2: Back on Track gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for track building on the go, Unrailed 2: Back on Track is now Steam Deck Verified even though it's not finished yet. It only released into Early Access on November 7th, and they plan around 1 year until it's done.</p>
<p>More about it: "Unrailed 2: Back on Track brings chaotic local and online multiplayer track-building action to the next level – band together with friends to collaborate and build your track across new procedurally generated worlds - WHILST the train is running! So think fast, with more freedom than ever before, and conquer new obstacles in your way - before your trains becomes… a trainwreck!"</p>
<p>Valve Verified it against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-3</a>. So you're thoroughly good to go on Desktop Linux too with that version. The developers of the game shared the news in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2211170/announcements/detail/4481739601737679116" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam post today</a>.</p>

<p>Since the initial release, the developers have been quick to put up improvements across multiple patches. I'm looking forward to it as a big fan of the first game, but I'm going to personally wait until it's had a little more time in the oven to add content.</p>

      <title>Linux Firmware Updater adds initial community support for ASUS ROG Ally and ROG Ally X</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>fwupd is a great tool to update firmware easily on Linux and version 2.0.2 was just released, bringing new features and support for more devices. By default, it pulls from the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (<a href="https://fwupd.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LVFS</a>), where hardware vendors can officially put up their firmware. Hopefully more hardware vendors will use it over time, quite a few already do.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On top of bug fixes and a few new features <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/releases/tag/2.0.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">version 2.0.2</a> is out now bringing support for these devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally and ROG Ally X (initial support, community provided).</li>
<li>Google GID8 headset.</li>
<li>j5create USB-C JCD373.</li>
<li>Logitech Sight (as standalone device).</li>
<li>MNT Pocket Reform.</li>
<li>Netprisma LCUR57 and FCUN69.</li>
<li>Parade PS188.</li>
<li>Quectel DFOTA devices.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Pico.</li>
<li>SteelSeries Nova 5.</li>
<li>Telink DFU-HID devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see some handheld gaming PCs get some support in there. Although it would be great if ASUS put it up directly. If you're interested in the ROG Ally support, it's from <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/pull/7782" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this linked pull request</a>.</p>
<p>In related news <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/valve-fixes-up-steam-input-bug-with-rog-ally-x/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve recently fixed up</a> a Steam Input bug with the ROG Ally X, plus at the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/bazzite-updated-to-fedora-41-with-expanded-pc-gaming-handheld-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">end of October the latest Bazzite release</a> also improved Linux support on the ROG Ally series.</p>

      <title>Star Fox 64 is getting a Native PC port from the devs of Ocarina Of Time and Zelda Majoras Mask ports</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Harbour Masters community of developers who are behind the PC ports of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ocarina Of Time </a>and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/2-ship-2-harkinian-another-unofficial-pc-port-of-zelda-majoras-mask-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zelda Majoras Mask</a> have revealed a Star Fox 64 Native PC port is coming.</p>
<p>Announced via their Discord, they made it clear there's no time-frame on when it will release as it's still in development. However, they've "gotten the game to a state where we feel comfortable showcasing it for you" and so they pulled in a community streamer to show it off that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WjGSFdQcNEs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/576ff94a9ca07de2fa480d6ba0a5fe03.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WjGSFdQcNEs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While you could play it via an emulator already, the Native PC ports do come with a lot of enhancements. Plus they're a building off point for people to do other fun mods with as well. It's also just great for continued game preservation.</p>
<p>Since the two previous projects have Native Linux support, it's likely this will too whenever they put it live on GitHub.</p>

      <title>Death has a cute little pig companion in action-adventure Spindle - check out the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spindle looks quite sweet, and one I haven't heard anything about for a while after its successful crowdfunding campaign <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/in-spindle-you-become-death-and-figure-out-why-no-one-is-dying-along-with-your-pet-pig/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2021</a>. But there's a new trailer to show it off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is it? An old-school action-adventure where you step into the role of Death. But you're not alone on your journey through this strange, chaotic world – your trusty sidekick, an ever-loyal pig, will be with you every step of the way. The story sounds interesting too. A world where nobody dies anymore resulting in some strange happenings and you have to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L3DFO8V5gH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/603610500b048429bb9c5d8b0a4e1d69.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L3DFO8V5gH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>ScummVM 2.9.0 for retro gaming is approaching and in need of testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ScummVM project is readying up another release, with the developers issuing a call for testing on ScummVM 2.9.0.</p>
<p>If you're just joining us and don't know what ScummVM does? ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. It replaces the original executable to launch the game, to get them running on modern systems with various enhancements. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20241123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they noted these newly supported games in particular need testing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Orion Burger.</li>
<li>Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.</li>
<li>Thimbleweed Park.</li>
<li>The Space Bar.</li>
<li>Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)</li>
<li>Backyard Basketball.</li>
<li>Unrest.</li>
<li>Rise of the Dragon.</li>
<li>Castle Master.</li>
<li>Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)</li>
<li>Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)</li>
<li>Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)</li>
<li>The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)</li>
<li>Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of newly supported games being added, they also said "almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes" so testing various other games will be helpful too.</p>
<p>The actual <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/branch-2-9/NEWS.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> of what's new and improved is a long as always.</p>

      <title>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault open source remake gets a first Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day has arrived! Medal of Honor: Allied Assault including the Spearhead and Breakthrough expansions can be played easily on modern systems, with various enhancements thanks to the OpenMoHAA project.</p>
<p>Just announced in the last day is version v0.80.0-beta, where they said "As all of the features from the original game are implemented and the stability increased, the project is transitioning from alpha to beta." — so it may be finally time to jump in.</p>
<p>More: "The main goal of OpenMoHAA is to ensure the future and continuity of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on all platforms/architectures by providing new patches/features. Thanks to the ioquake3 project and the F.A.K.K SDK, OpenMoHAA has already reached more than half of its goal: an open-source version of MoH:AA (based on version 2.40) that is fully compatible with the original game (in terms of protocol, assets, and scripts)."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17267905441732523410gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17267905441732523410gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMoHAA on Linux, taken today</em></p>
<p>There's a fair amount of enhancements to the game like full 64-bit support, an SDL2 backend, OpenAL sound support, cross-platform support, lots of bug fixes, demo recording, smoother animations, bots for servers, IP bans for servers and so on.</p>
<p>For anyone who did try it previously, the highlights of new stuff to the Beta include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 3 launchers for simplicity, to start Allied Assault, Spearhead or Breakthrough</li>
<li>Rendering
	<ul>
<li>Better lighting</li>
<li>Decals / level marks are now rendered</li>
<li>Dynamic lights are now renderered properly, no more ground blinking issues when shooting rockets</li>
<li>Entities are now lit better by sphere lights (some artifacts are still present)</li>
<li>Sunflares are now rendered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI fixes (animations, logic, seeing through windows, holding turrets, speech animation...)</li>
<li>Animation fixes + smoother animations</li>
<li>Audio system enhancement</li>
<li>Better FX</li>
<li>Briefing videos from Spearhead and Breakthrough and game intro are working</li>
<li>Crashes fix</li>
<li>Demos are now supported using <code class="inline-code">+set com_target_demo 1</code> launch command-line</li>
<li>Fixed mods not loading properly</li>
<li>Fixed weird movement artifacts when running server on ARM</li>
<li>Less crashes</li>
<li>Network profiling</li>
<li>Script engine fixes + better mod support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy the original game for the data files it needs from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>See more on the project <a href="https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Running it on Linux was quite easy. I used the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a> to download the game from <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, then dropped the release files from the OpenMoHAA into the installed folder and launched it.</p>

      <title>UnderworldGodot is an engine recreation of Ultima Underworld 1 &amp; 2 in Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking over from the original Unity-based project, UnderworldGodot is an engine recreation of Ultima Underworld and Ultima Underworld 2 in the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Great for preservation of some classics.</p>
<p>Writing on the now archived GitHub of the <a href="https://github.com/hankmorgan/UnderworldExporter" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">original</a> Unity version, the developer noted the move to Godot was to "ensure the engine and software is more fully open source as well as avoiding risks due to Unity licencing changes". The project is a reboot and aims to "act more like the Underworld games originally worked".</p>
<p>Setting some expectations, the developer notes it's to be considered "pre-alpha" with no support, so don't expect it to be playable yet. It does have a long list of features already implemented, but there's also a lot still missing in it.</p>

      <title>JSAUX released their first White 6-in-1 Docking Station for handhelds like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX have released another Docking Station, this time it's White and it does look rather nice. A good match for the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-white-and-steam-deck-australia-have-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White launch</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/the-new-detachable-jsaux-dock-will-fit-a-steam-deck-rog-ally-x-legion-go-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one I previously covered</a>, just with the colour change to match. I must admit though, I really do love it in White. For people worried it will yellow over time, like a lot of White tech, JSAUX said: "If you’re old enough, you might recall that white hardware often turns yellow over time. To ensure our white Docking Stations stay white throughout their use, we carefully selected high-quality raw materials. Thanks to these materials and advanced anti-aging techniques, we’ve achieved a durable, lasting white finish that perfectly matches your white Steam Deck."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13026297781732520664gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1* USB-C port for connecting to the handheld device.<br/>
1* USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).<br/>
2* USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).<br/>
1* Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps).<br/>
1* HDMI (4K@120Hz).<br/>
1* USB-C (PD 100W input).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's usually $45.99, but they have a sale on right now so it's $42.99 until December 5th. Pretty great price really for what you get. And the dock itself can be pulled out from the stand too so you can use it easily with other devices that don't need a stand.</p>
<p>JSAUX say it will fit properly and work with the ROG Ally X, ROG Ally, Steam Deck, and Legion Go.</p>

      <title>Wine 9.22 released noting the &#39;Wayland driver enabled in default configuration&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Closing in on the Wine 10 stable release now! Wine 9.22 has been released, ahead of the first release candidate for Wine 10 in two weeks time. The Wine 10 release itself is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/windows-to-linux-compatibility-layer-wine-10-0-planned-for-mid-january-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">due for sometime around mid-January</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.22" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> the highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for display mode virtualization.</li>
<li>Locale data updated to Unicode CLDR 46.</li>
<li>More support for network sessions in DirectPlay.</li>
<li>Wayland driver enabled in default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5583" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, it seems Wayland is only currently used when x11 fails. So it's enabled, but not the default go-to, likely as more Wayland work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>There's also bug fixes noted for Dark Souls Remastered, World Of Warcraft and Steam. Plus a few other miscellaneous behaviour fixes.</p>

      <title>War Thunder adds stealth tech, ray tracing and graphics upgrades in the Firebirds update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every time a new War Thunder update comes out, I think to myself: I'm finally going to progress a bit more into the aircraft research and then get side-tracked by tanks. But now, with stealth added in the Firebirds update, I might just have to sink some more hours in.</p>
<p>An exciting addition is the F-117A (Squadron Vehicle) which brings in a brand new stealth capability to the game. The developers note this craft has a "lower IR and radio signature". There's also multiple other aircraft including the F-15E, Su-34, Tornado GR.4 and Mirage 2000 RMV. There's also multiple new helicopters and new tanks.</p>
<p>But there's a lot more to this update as they've added in AMD FSR 3.1, DLAA, XeSS, TSR, Direct3D 12 (beta) and Ray Tracing (beta) with an overhaul to the graphics settings menu. They say they're looking at adding frame generation for a future update too. There's also some small reworks to multiple locations, but the "Abandoned Factory" got a huge upgrade visually and looks awesome. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z7_LWZxyhdY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e334888f3a100ccc516be905aecdd337.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z7_LWZxyhdY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has Native Linux support with Vulkan, it looks like AMD FSR, XeSS and Ray Tracing are all currently only available via DirectX 12 - so you'll need to run War Thunder with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to see any of that. <em>I'm hoping they continue to work on their Vulkan renderer too.</em></p>
<p>See a lot more about the update on the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236390/view/4455841997094125905" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Truckful, a driving adventure mystery game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful was revealed back in July, and the idea of it had me really intrigued and now they have a new trailer up for this driving action-adventure mystery game. It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>What seems like initially a peaceful but challenging game about trucking and delivering packages, where you upgrade your vehicle as you go, and have to learn how to handle some tricky roads with all sorts of packages seems to soon turn into something a bit weirder. As they said when it was announced: </p>
<p>"This seemingly idyllic countryside hides its fair share of mysteries, though. The ancient forest on the outskirts whispers through local legends and folklore, its dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadows… Explore hidden paths, navigate misty wetlands, and brave treacherous marshes and quicksands to uncover the truth beneath the branches."</p>
<p>Anyway, announced during The MIX Fall Showcase 2024 was a new trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sS3hpCthbqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f1beb824aab9502bc742aeaa0b54a86d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sS3hpCthbqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive, upgrade and customize your pickup truck</li>
<li>Pack the truck bed with cargo of all shapes and sizes</li>
<li>Complete errands for villagers in need</li>
<li>Enjoy a physics-based car handling gameplay</li>
<li>Unravel the mystery of the old forest</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free-to-play pixel art survival game Ruins To Fortress arrives December 13</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruins To Fortress looks like it could be interesting, a post-apocalyptic free-to-play pixel art open survival game. The developers have announced it's going to enter Early Access on December 13th.</p>
<p>Like a sort of blending somewhere between Terraria and Starbound, set on a single island where you craft tools, grow food, build formidable defences, and raze enemy bases. Here though you can either cooperate, or go after rivals so it's more on the competitive side. So perhaps a bit more like a side-scrolling Rust as you'll be able to host your own servers too.</p>
<p>They also have a new trailer to show it off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WH9SqPen_bY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e1a2014cbd212f49d0e3546bba33a15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WH9SqPen_bY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it will be free they will be offering a single DLC to support the game that will include what sounds like mostly cosmetic items.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included gets a Free Weekend, big update live and new DLC coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is one of my favourites from Klei Entertainment, a space-colony simulation game that's Steam Deck Verified and has full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>If you still haven't tried it out, there's good news. A Free Weekend for it is live on Steam so you can try it completely free all weekend, and it has a big 66% discount on it too.</p>
<p>A new DLC was also revealed with Oxygen Not Included: The Bionic Booster Pack that "revolutionizes the workforce with new bionic Duplicants, skill-enhancing bionic booster modules, portable power storage, and remote-work buildings—everything you need to create a colony of cosmic proportions".</p>
<p>These bionic Duplicants sound really useful, since they can work in low-breathability environments thanks to having their own little oxygen supply. A lot more to it like portable power banks for your bionic buddies, rockets that can be pilot-less, remote-work buildings and new cosmetic items. No release date for it yet though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20774611031732273143gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the free update for all players it's quite a big one too. It includes new buildings for everyone, upgrades to the schedule system, various UI improvements and lots of bug fixes across the base game and other DLC.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.3.0 graphics drivers for Linux released with many new features and bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Dylan Baker announced the early release of Mesa 24.3.0, the latest set of Linux open source graphics drivers full of new features. As usual they suggested waiting on Mesa 24.3.1 if you want stability.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the release announcement email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I'd hoped we were able to pull in the Mesa 24.3 release cycle by one week! Thanks to everyone who helped close or dismiss blocking issues! This is great, as it means we'll leap frog both the US Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. This does mean that we will have a release due on New Years day, I will release that either the Thursday or Friday if there anything worth releasing (that two weeks is generally quite slow), otherwise we'll plan to just skip that resume on January 15th.</p>
<p>This release has seen the continuing trend of OpenGL work slowing down and Vulkan work speeding up. Anv, Radv, Nvk, and v3dv dominate the list of new features, with v3dv gaining Vulkan 1.3 conformance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/24.3.0.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> all of these are newly supported features:</p>

<li>Expose Vulkan 1.3 on v3dv, both rpi4 and rpi5</li>
<li>VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer on nvk</li>

      <title>Dungeon Clawler will grab hold of your free time now it&#39;s in Early Access, plus keys to give away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stray Fawn Studio developers of The Wandering Village and Nimbatus have released their latest game into Early Access with Dungeon Clawler. It has Native Linux support, and while it has no Steam Deck rating yet the developer mentioned they've done extensive testing to ensure it's a good experience.</p>
<p>Ever lost a good amount of change to a claw machine in an arcade? I know I have. When you think "that next coin will do it!", well it's a little like that, only you <em>won't</em> lose so much money (it's only £8.50). Here it blends a claw machine, with a deck-builder, turn-based combat and a little bit of dungeon exploration on top. Pretty clever and unique, especially with all the different ways it will mess with you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3UDTxqZf0qw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30f0095372d7abb081ead50f08a711f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3UDTxqZf0qw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate claw machine roguelike experience..</li>
<li>Alot of interesting items and perks to build your deck</li>
<li>Unique characters each with their different strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Multiple difficulty levels and unlockable lucky paws to customize your run.</li>
<li>Break the game – go crazy with different claw and item synergies.</li>
<li>Venture into mystery locations and discover treasures as well as strange and dangerous obstacles.</li>
<li>Spend your hard earned coins in the dungeon's pachinko machines..</li>
<li>Meet different characters who might help you on your journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A little history behind its development:</p>
<p>"Dungeon Clawler is Stray Fawn Studio's fifth self-developed game. It started as a small side project of Micha, one of the studio's co-founders. Fueled by the passion for roguelike-games and a fondness for claw machines that they first discovered on a journey to Tokyo (and its arcades), the project grew and garnered more and more interest. It has now blossomed into a unique roguelike deckbuilding experience, combining the elements of traditional deckbuilders with an arcade-like claw machine mechanic." — Stray Fawn Studio</p>
<p>Gosh I love indie developers, making all kinds of smaller games that really suck you in like this.</p>
<p><strong>Giveaway</strong></p>
<p>Want to win a copy? The developer sent over two Steam keys to give away. All you have to do is comment clearly you would like to enter. This is open to all users old and new. Giveaway will end Monday, November 25th at 7PM UTC. Winners will be sent a DM here on GamingOnLinux.</p>

      <title>Give your Steam Deck a refreshed look with these new Razer skins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Popular hardware vendor Razer have announced a couple of new fancy skins for the Steam Deck, so if you're wanting to give it a little more style perhaps you might find something you like.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I didn't even know Razer were doing skins for the Steam Deck until a link was dropped into the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>. They actually have 9 flashy looking covers to wrap around your Deck to keep it cosy and looking fresh. A nice alternative to swapping the shell from the likes of JSAUX and eXtremeRate, or buying a Limited Edition Steam Deck from Valve.</p>
<p>The two new skins are Sludge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2048925951732204208gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2048925951732204208gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19473990861732204209gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19473990861732204209gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then Acid Sludge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1052007531732204209gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1052007531732204209gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729992971732204247gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8729992971732204247gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Must admit, that Acid Sludge really does look <em>awesome</em> on the back of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, they don't seem to be available in the UK, so I couldn't get them even if I wanted. Looks like they might only be available in the US.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.razer.com/skins" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Razer store</a>.</p>
<p>Have you got a skin on your Steam Deck? Did you manage to get it bubble free? Leave a comment.</p>

      <title>Squad-tactics cyberpunk strategy game Cyber Knights: Flashpoint now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The supremely cool XCOM-like squad-tactics game Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from developers Trese Brothers is now properly Steam Deck Verified. After going through over 170 updates in Early Access, the Trese Brothers are absolutely relentless at expanding the game and enhancing it from player input. </p>
<p>As they said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4445710804718714886" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to the players in the forums, on reddit and in our Discord who have been giving us feedback on both our default controls and the Steam Deck experience. We're continuing to work on improvements here and there (e.g. the filtering in cold storage, squashing any bugs reported through the in-game click left stick system), but the overall playability is feeling great. Verification signifies we've now checked off the final few details with text size (adjustable in the Options menu as well) and every keybinding in the game properly showing controller prompts (all fully rebindable). And Cyber Knights provides a native Linux build, so great performance with no need for Proton.<br/>
<br/>
As most of you know, we're on a hot streak with...</p>
<ul>
<li>a new map being added each week</li>
<li>the new Gunslinger class (bringing us to 44 total possible character class combinations!)</li>
<li>last season's big push of major feature additions</li>
<li>being right on the threshold of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>...so Steam Deck Verification (and our ongoing rollout of new content) feels like a great way to wrap up the fall season. If you know any Deck players, please do tell them about our game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16190216111732203574gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Absolutely love what they're doing with this game, I'm thoroughly amazed every time I jump in at how much they've expanded it.</p>

      <title>Khronos Group takes over cross-platform Slang shading language from NVIDIA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interesting industry news here for you, especially for developers. The Khronos Group announced they've launched the Slang Initiative, taking over the Slang shading language supported by NVIDIA since 2017.</p>
<p>No longer being tied to a single graphics vendor, instead under the wing of the multi-company governance at Khronos, means it can truly be a proper modern open standard for everyone. </p>
<p>Slang is supported across "D3D12, Vulkan, Metal, D3D11, OpenGL, CUDA, and even generate code to run on a CPU. For textual targets, such as Metal Shading Language (MSL) and CUDA".</p>
<p>Some choice quotes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-group-launches-slang-initiative-hosting-open-source-compiler-contributed-by-nvidia" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“Slang is now a significant shading language option for graphics developers everywhere, as all are enabled to directly influence and participate in its ongoing development,” said Neil Trevett, president of The Khronos Group and vice president developer ecosystems, NVIDIA. “Khronos’s innovative Slang governance structure blends open-source development agility with the patent safeguards of open standards. Slang is freely available for any platform or API to use, including Khronos, which will leverage Slang in the Vulkan ecosystem while ensuring SPIR-V remains responsive to Slang’s requirements."</p>
<p>“NVIDIA will continue its longstanding investment in Slang, which is designed to meet the needs of today’s graphics developers while paving the way for the neural graphics revolution,” said Nicholas Haemel, vice president of graphics and system software, NVIDIA. “With Slang in open governance at Khronos, the graphics community can collaboratively advance and harness the advantages of cross-platform support, scalable graphics systems, reduced compile times, and enhanced modularity.”</p>
<p>“The process of getting our large HLSL shader codebase working with Slang went extremely smoothly. We were able to integrate Slang into the Source 2 engine and ship the generated SPIR-V into production on multiple titles, including Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2, with minimal changes to our shaders. After completing the initial integration, we have since adopted some of the advanced features of Slang, such as BufferPointer, enumerants, interfaces, and generics. We are very thankful for NVIDIA offering Slang to the open-source community and believe ongoing contributions from multiple companies within Khronos will help ensure a healthy future for Slang,” said Dan Ginsburg, software developer, Valve.</p>

      <title>Steam getting proper Season Pass support with clearer guidelines and refunds for cancellations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have another Steam store update incoming, with seemingly proper built-in support for a Season Pass along with new guidance for developers.</p>
<p>Initially spotted by SteamDB developer Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbfpzdgjdc23" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> pointing out a new Steamworks page for <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Season Passes</a>. Valve note on this page that Season Pass store pages will be listing all of the DLC included, along with their release dates. If developers aren't ready to clearly tell you when each DLC will be released then developers "shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam".</p>
<p>Valve said they will only offer Season Passes to developers "in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam".</p>
<p>The new guidelines include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a Season Pass is made available for purchase on Steam, it must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete list of all DLC included in the Pass. (i.e. listing each of the four DLCs included in a Pass).</li>
<li>A basic description of the content that’s included in each DLC. For example, the first content release might be “The Glitterlands Expansion – New area to explore, two new weapons, and new enemies.” It’s not required for the DLC to have a final name at the launch of the Season Pass. The information about the content in the DLC doesn’t need to be detailed (simply “new weapons” or “two new weapons” is acceptable, they don’t have to list the exact weapons).</li>
<li>Expected release date for each DLC. Quarter and Year (i.e. January to March 2025) or Season/Year is acceptable. Of course, a date that’s more precise is also fine (i.e. June, 2025 or June 1st, 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<u>A Season Pass must include at least one released DLC when it is made available for purchase*</u><br/>
*with the exception of Season Passes included in a Pre-Purchase of a deluxe edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If developers need to delay an included DLC they get a one-time release date delay by up to three months. If they need longer, they need to contact Valve directly. However, if a DLC in a Season Pass is cancelled, gamers will be "offered a refund for the value of unreleased DLC".</p>
<p>Not a big surprise to see, since it's a much-used feature by plenty of bigger developers. Just like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/valve-makes-paid-advanced-access-a-clear-feature-on-steam-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access being a thing</a>, Valve continue moving with what developers are doing. By making it an actual dedicated feature, Valve can ensure some quality-control there for gamers by holding developers to account on repeated delays and cancellations.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes up Steam Input bug with ROG Ally X</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve confirmed back in August</a> they still had plans to release SteamOS 3 outside of the Steam Deck for other handhelds, and it's nice to see they're still working away on the Steam Client for various hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/gamescope-gets-improved-rog-ally-support-hinting-at-more-progress-for-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In October</a> we saw an update for Gamescope from the community that improved configuring the display on the ASUS ROG Ally and the newer ASUS ROG Ally X, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steamos-alternative-bazzite-adds-support-for-onexplayer-plus-improvements-for-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was actually for the SteamOS-like Bazzite</a>, one of the best ways to use Linux on various PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Now the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4489620901087674430?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest</a> Steam Client Beta has a fix included for Steam Input directly on the ASUS ROG Ally X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed audio desync that occurs for some videos when played in Steam or Chrome browser.</li>
<li>Added settings button to allow resetting the game recording folder to the default path.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed duplicate controllers showing up on the ROG Ally X.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed store and community features being disabled when streaming to a Mac.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So at least for now if you're using some other form of Linux, like Bazzite, or Windows, with the latest Steam Client Beta the experience should be a little better without the duplicated controllers.</p>

      <title>itch.io store now requires AI generated content disclosures for assets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With AI generated content continuing to spread everywhere, the <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> store has made a change to now require AI generated content disclosures.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://itch.io/t/4309690/generative-ai-disclosure-tagging" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> it specifically mentions it's now <em>required</em> for "Asset Creators" meaning developers who provide things like graphics, sounds and more for developers to use in their games. All pages get the option though, so game developers can tag their creations as using or not using AI.</p>
<p>From their updated guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recently added the AI Disclosure feature. You will have time to review and update your pages accordingly, but we are strictly enforcing disclosure for all game asset pages due to legal ambiguity around rights associated with Generative AI content. Failure to tag your asset page may result in delisting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve made a similar move for Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in early January</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good change, because the store is getting flooded with it. Doing a quick search today, and keep in mind this is only those that are correctly tagged, showed 1,214 assets on itch.io that were made using some form of AI generation versus 13,536 now tagged as not using AI generation.</p>
<p>A number of game developers have updated their itch.io pages too, with it showing 337 made using AI generation at time of writing.</p>

      <title>Monster catcher Cassette Beasts adds Steam Workshop support and a new battle mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts from Bytten Studio is a brilliant spin on the whole monster catching genre, and a fresh update out now continues expanding it.</p>
<p>The Gauntlet Update, version 1.7, has release and the first major addition is Magikrab's Gauntlet, a series of randomised combat encounters that can be played solo or online with a friend. And, to enhance things even further, modding should be a whole lot easier with Steam Workshop support now enabled for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="auwooxCiZhU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/693bdbe001d8d0d23ac6ac673f9b8fc7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/auwooxCiZhU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main New Additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Magikrab’s Gauntlet has been added. This is a new gameplay system that is available in Night’s Bridge Station after completing the Land of Confusion and Take Me On quests.
	<ul>
<li>In the gauntlet you face an endless series of randomised and increasingly difficult battles against friends and foes old and new.</li>
<li>You can take on the gauntlet on your own, or invite a friend through online multiplayer to take on the challenges together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ranger Wilma now provides a Sticker Fusion service after you’ve completed Land of Confusion and Take Me On. Sticker Fusion allows you to move rare and uncommon attributes you like from one sticker to another.</li>
<li>After Frankie has completed her training, you can speak to her in the Town Hall to clear the ranger noticeboard of quests you don’t want. This costs a certain amount of Fused Material, and you get no quest rewards.</li>
<li>During multiplayer raids and gauntlet battles you can now:
	<ul>
<li>Use items</li>
<li>Fuse with your partner NPC</li>
<li>Switch to your partner NPC’s tape</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support has been added.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cassette Beasts has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. It's also just thoroughly cool, you should check it out. Another great one made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve pushed out a new stable Steam Deck Client update which includes some pretty essential sounding bug fixes. This was release for everyone on November 19th.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4472732402493423624" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well there's a surprise. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered from Guerrilla Games / Nixxes Software and PlayStation Publishing has been given the Steam Deck Verified <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> tick from Valve.</p>
<p>Despite the game bringing in some more enhanced rendering and updated graphics, it appears it's running well enough for Valve to think the "game works great on Steam Deck, right out of the box". It does, however, need an internet connection for first-time setup thanks to the forcing of a PlayStation Network Account.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rgDYyxOKBgg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bacbcfdc514ff85c6a89bad568a4607f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rgDYyxOKBgg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The release came with Ultrawide 21:9 and Super Ultrawide 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 triple monitor support, NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XeSS. So if you're playing on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> you've got plenty of options to tweak it to your liking.</p>
<p>Valve's testing on Steam Deck used the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>
<p>As I reported previously, for Desktop Linux you likely need a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-may-need-a-workaround-on-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quick launch option</a> to run it properly.</p>
<p>Have you been playing on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux? How's your experience been?</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl review - works on Linux Desktop with Proton but poorly on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl from GSC Game World has now been released and after playing it pre-release, I've had a damn fun time with it. There's some clear issues though, that I'll get into. <em>Disclosure: key provided by Renaissance PR.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, the game works out of the box on Desktop Linux. With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>, everything works as expected, including the intro video with no broken test-screen. Being able to play it instantly has been quite a highlight of this year. It’s a <em>huge</em> game, both in terms of world size and install size, you’re going to need to free up some space because it’s about 160GB!</p>
<p>Do you need to play the originals? No. While it <em>does</em> follow on from the originals, it’s a standalone game with its own story. The developers <em>suggest</em> playing the originals to "maximize the immersion". But really, it’s fine. You may not get every reference here and there, but it all explains itself as you play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209864151732034296gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209864151732034296gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When you first load up the game, you will need to let it compile shaders, it does this before you even get into the main menu. That initial compiling took about 13 minutes, so it takes a little while, but features like this are worth it to get a smoother game overall. So grab a coffee.</p>
<p>The developers say that no procedural generation was used in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornoby, <em>everything</em> was made by hand. They even used photogrammetry, along with real objects and places with prominent landmarks included from the real world. However, plenty has been rearranged for the sake of the gameplay, they say it’s “fictionally revised”.</p>
<p><em>Note: there will probably be some form of spoilers from here on out.</em></p>

<h4><strong>Steam Deck Performance</strong></h4>
<p>Now a few quick words on Steam Deck performance and expectations because this won’t take long. Truthfully, I <em>didn’t</em> expect it to be playable and… it’s really not.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s the initial shader compiling. On Steam Deck (OLED) it took 51 minutes to complete. It will do it each time you load the game fresh too, but much faster, only about 2 minutes. The initial shader compiling also took a whole 40% battery time away - ouch.</p>
<p>After that, there’s no controller input at all. It sometimes detected I was using a controller (the Deck itself) showing gamepad button prompts, but no actual input. Switching it over to Keyboard / Mouse in Steam Input at least allows you to continue. To be fair, it’s advertised with “Partial Controller Support” on Steam, but that’s clearly pushing it.</p>
<p>It only gets worse from this point on.</p>
<p>Performance is <em>awful</em>. Truly bad. Tested on the <em>lowest</em> possible settings in the game, even with nothing going on, it’s often well below 30FPS. Without upscaling, it’s about 15FPS. Then trying it with all the various upscalers in the game, and you can at times get it to <em>briefly</em> give you around 30FPS at select moments, but it’s mostly going to be around 20FPS and below.</p>
<p>This screenshot below is 1280x800, the Low preset, with AMD FSR set to Ultra Performance and it should speak for itself at 23FPS:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18494085041732032242gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18494085041732032242gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>How about FSR 3 Frame Generation? It may give you a few more FPS in some cases, but it destroys the Frame Timing and turns it into something comical with input all over the place. See the screenshot below, in the top left notice the frame timing going wild resulting in serious input delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2842523511732032243gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2842523511732032243gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>FSR 3 Frame Generation really needs the game to already perform quite well to actually make a difference.</p>
<p>That performance only gets <em>worse</em> at various points I tested, some dropping below 10FPS on the lowest possible settings. This is just <u>clearly</u> just <em>not</em> a game for the Steam Deck. Even if you managed to get the performance higher doing extra tweaks like we often see after releases, the low visuals simply aren't worth it in this.</p>
<p><em>Edit: release day update note - Valve set it as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Desktop Linux Performance</strong></h4>
<p>On Kubuntu 24.10 with my Ryzen 5800X / Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 resolution, I’ve gone through various settings to see where I could get it performing well. And, quick tip here, Steam Game Recording seemed to suck away a good 20FPS from this game, so I would make sure it’s not recording for it. Some games just don’t play particularly nice with it.</p>
<p>For reference, here’s their suggested system requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4066123991731671887gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4066123991731671887gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, the developers put a small note in the actual Steam system requirements, to note even the Minimum listed specifications were using upscaling.</p>
<p>With that in mind. Performance here will depend of course on your hardware, and your chosen upscaling. At 1440p resolution on the High preset as per their suggestion based on my system, using no upscaling simply <em>wasn’t</em> an option, performance was all over the place often dropping well below 60FPS, even when dropping it down to Medium.</p>
<p>Eventually I settled on TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) “Quality” with 80% Resolution Scale, which works <em>impressively</em> well on both the visual quality and performance uplift. Add into that FSR 3 Frame Generation, and often it was sitting usually above 80FPS and often a fair amount higher even on the High preset.</p>
<p>As an example here, in a pretty empty area with nothing going on. High settings preset, Frame Generation (Left), and with no Frame Generation (Right):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4248529471732032443gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4248529471732032443gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12311106061732032445gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12311106061732032445gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>So <em>without</em> any FSR 3 Frame Generation, this empty area was hovering just at 60FPS (that’s with TSR at 80% resolution scale as well). FSR 3 Frame Generation added just about 50FPS. Frame Gen also improved the Frame Timings too so it's overall smoother.</p>
<p>While I am impressed how smooth Frame Generation makes it, clearly the game directly just <em>needs</em> various performance improvements and is quite messy without upscaling. Perhaps we may see future Proton improvements to help it too like we’ve seen for other games. Even though plenty of it performed well with my settings, numerous parts also did not perform well regardless of the settings picked.</p>
<h4><strong>Gameplay</strong></h4>
<p>Note: review codes came quite close to release, so i’m short on time to fully explore everything i wanted to, and a basic play through is around 40 hours <em>at least</em>. Additionally, there’s multiple endings depending on what you do, and given that it’s a pretty dynamic open-world game, other people may get to see a <em>very</em> different experience.</p>
<p>I should probably preface this by noting that this is the first time I’ve personally <em>properly</em> experienced this world, after bouncing off the older games for various reasons. I just couldn't get into them. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 though, this is very much my jam.</p>
<p>For people new to the series, keep in mind this is <em>not</em> a fast-paced run and gun FPS. It’s supposed to be an immersive first-person exploration horror shooter. You start with very little and it’s all about looting as you go. It’s a thoroughly challenging game, and that’s how it’s designed, they say it’s an “anti-power fantasy”, as you’re just another expendable person exploring a hostile environment. With no levelling system, you <em>need</em> to loot to get a better chance at surviving for better weapons, equipment and items to just keep you somewhat alive (but probably a bit irradiated).</p>
<p>It’s a survival game too where you’ll be dealing with hunger, bleeding, sleep and radiation that all need a constant watch over, so you’ll need to be stocking up on plenty of supplies. No character choice though, you're simply thrust into the shoes of Skif.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18025324531732032629gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18025324531732032629gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the difficulty, it can be pretty <em>brutal</em>. However, they have thankfully included difficulty modes. The intended experience <em>is</em> for it to be difficult, but not impossible. There’s even a Rookie mode for you to get more forgiving combat to help you explore the world, and you can change the difficulty at any point. My play-through has been with their intended middle difficulty.</p>
<p>The world is huge too, “64-km²” they say, and it does take a <em>long</em> time to travel across it. Half the time because of so many <em>distractions</em> and encounters. Totally seamless though, no special loading screens to get in the way of the exploration and action.</p>
<p>While there is a main story quest line to follow, outside of that there’s this loop that you end up doing. Going through each different zone, talking to everyone you can to grab side-quests, then gearing up to go and explore. You repeat this quite a lot, and as you explore you’ll likely uncover more random side-quests that continually have you explore more, and further into danger. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, like most open world games, is very much what you make of it. You could blast through it a lot quicker, but half the fun is in all the encounters and some of the side-quests are pretty good.</p>
<p>Part of this loop is also hunting for artifacts, special items you can equip in a slot to help you on your travels. You'll see lots of different anomalies in the Zone, and you have equipment that not only warns you about them with beeps, but you can pull it out to help you hunt down where exactly an artifact might be found in select areas. There's a few different types of these detectors you'll find on your travels.</p>
<p>As for the artifacts, they all have different buffs and debuffs and different levels of each and even just finding them can cause a whole lot of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21154181831732037350gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21154181831732037350gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19633096511732037351gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19633096511732037351gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>While they can give you some protection, they can also cause some serious radiation issues. So they're very much a constant toss-up between risk / reward to use.</p>
<p>Something I did find slightly funny, is the <em>yellow paint</em> styled objects being a thing even in a game like this. You’ll see it in various places, indicating you can do something like climb a ladder or break apart some wood. It’s quite subtle, but still amusing to see it in such a game.</p>
<p>The game can feel somewhat alive, thanks to all the various NPC encounters. You’ll see groups roaming, that will encounter each other and fight without you even needing to get involved. You can watch the fireworks from the sidelines and scoop up some loot later, or engage and speed things up a bit and potentially save some extra ammo if you manage to do it quietly.</p>
<p>While it’s not meant to be a fast-paced game, I wouldn’t say it was particularly stealthy or slow either. Enemies seem to spot you quite easily even from afar, and track you a bit after you move around too. I can’t say I’ve really experienced a whole lot of this “Advanced artificial intelligence system” that they talk about a fair bit. When a single enemy in a group, not actually next to the group, spots you, they all seem to just <em>instantly</em> know where you are and turn to you guns blazing. This is typical of most shooters but here I was expecting a little more smarts from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. The amount of times I tried certain encounters over and over and <em>over again</em> with different methods, always found by one single person setting off the whole group - I ended up just going in guns blazing myself a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Your movement speed is somewhat quick too, and while you can crouch, you cannot go prone - which feels a bit <em>odd</em> here if you’re wanting to be more stealthy. I get it though, it’s <em>not</em> meant to be a fully tactical game, but there’s so many situations it would have been great to have. Especially as the current stealth system is…not especially great.</p>
<p>Wonderful atmosphere all the way through. Especially with the day and night cycle, and then the weather system on top of that. Rain, full-on storms - it all really adds to the immersion. The storms especially can look awesome at night while you’re out and about.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7875088791732032762gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7875088791732032762gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One interesting game mechanic here is that you have an unlimited supply of bolts. You can pull them out any time, and throw them at various types of Anomalies in the game to set them off. This allows you to see where certain types start and end, plus move past them safely once they’ve been set off and you get a few seconds cool-down before they reappear.</p>
<p>You’ll be using this feature a lot to access certain areas, some may even surround some fun loot. One particular quest had me direct an NPC through a field of electrical anomalies, and it took me a while to get it right without killing them or us both.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1312371401732032849gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1312371401732032849gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There’s a lot that can go wrong in this game. So my one big tip for anyone jumping in: <strong>save early, save often</strong>. Mash that F5 button, <em>wear it out</em>. Also, the game doesn’t pause when you’re messing with your inventory, so don’t stick around for too long. Saves are great! Especially when you’re low on health, heading towards somewhere that may have some loot, only to come across a group of bandits and just when you think you’re going to live with 1HP and a dream after taking them down for their loot, a cute little anomaly appears and gives you the sweet kiss of death. I did say it was brutal right?</p>
<p>Some of the encounters I will never forget. Exploring early on, low health, trying to find some meds when suddenly I heard this almighty roar. My character was freaking out, the screen went all weird and clearly something was close by. But what? It felt like it was <em>stalking</em> me a bit, the top of the screen was glowing red, clearly showing an enemy is nearby and I could hear it grunting. I didn’t get a chance to see though, because some weird anomaly appeared as I was searching for it that sucked me in and — dead. Reloaded, explored the same area, and ended up finding 5 med packs close-ish to where I died, great success.</p>
<p>5 minutes later, I heard that roar again, so I quietly explored around some more. Eventually, I came to a house that clearly had a tunnel dug into it from below. Did I explore it? You bet I did! Did I regret that decision? Also very much yes. I saw a dead body, and thought “great, some loot!” and then out of the darkness ahead came a very <em>angry</em> speedy Bloodsucker that wanted me for dinner. That might be one of the most crazy-terrifying moments I’ve had in a game. I died <em>again</em>, obviously.</p>
<p>I love the environmental interactions in this too. Those Bloodsuckers make my heart beat real fast, and seeing them near water is quite fun, because even though they have some sort of cloaking, you can spot them through the water like in the shot below, you’ll see the ripples. That was an especially fun encounter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13400746291732032984gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13400746291732032984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is just insanely intense all the time you’re exploring as you never know quite what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Another time I came out of a tunnel, minding my own business, and was suddenly pushed to the floor with a grunt. Got up, looked around and saw a bunch of what looked like wild boar running rampant trying to attack me. After running for a few seconds to safety on top of a truck, I suddenly heard a load of barking. A whole pack of mutated dogs had come along for some fun too, and then the boar just seemed to chase them around. Guess what happened next? I died, because the truck I jumped onto for <em>safety</em> was a super-source of radiation. <em>Nothing in this game is safe dammit.</em></p>
<p>Some parts of the general design I found <em>odd</em> that I didn’t like though including only being able to lean if you’re holding a gun. But what if I want to peek around a corner with a knife? Nope. There’s also the sin of some NPCs running slower than you walk, which is especially <em>annoying</em> on certain quests you pick. The mantling system to climb up something is also pretty rubbish, and only works at seemingly very select places. On top of that, in some places, even the slightest jump down can kill you. You know the times I'm talking about I'm sure, it happens in other games, you look and think "even my unfit ass could jump / side down that without a single injury".</p>
<p>While there’s no character-specific upgrade system, there’s still plenty of ways to customise your whole experience. Weapons, for example, can be <em>individually</em> tweaked with various attachments and upgrades. It can get a little costly though depending on how many you wish to keep around. You also need to deal with weapon durability, and if it drops too low bullets will get jammed. Weapon durability can end up a fatal mistake to ignore, when you’ve got some good loot and a pack of hostile people or creatures come across you. Weapons end up wearing out somewhat quicker than I was expecting too, which is thoroughly annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18089629711732033055gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18089629711732033055gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16317179191732033056gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16317179191732033056gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The overall dynamic nature of it means some quests and side-quests can go a fair bit differently each time, depending on your involvement, or not at all if you step out of the way.</p>
<p>One particular quest came to mind where I tried talking a group out of killing someone in a house, but they didn’t listen. As they were about to go in, the person hiding came running out guns-blazing at them. First time around, the person in the house managed to take them all down after running outside and taking cover. Second time the group point blank shot the person the second they stepped outside, which was quite comical to see after the initial run of it due to how abrupt it was. Just <em>pow</em>, dead.</p>
<p>I’ve also had quite a lot of times where I’m out roaming for loot when enemies spotted and started firing at me, only for a big creature to come along and annihilate them so I could run away while they’re all distracted. So many little events that keep going throughout the game, and you get to choose what to do about them all.</p>
<p>Something I truly hated though is the weight system. I can't think of a single time, in any game – ever, that has made being overencumbered in any way fun. It's a game mechanic I despise. Let me stock up on things without slowing to a crawl. Considering how far between traders are, and your own stash, it's just a ridiculous nuisance. Let me hoard sausages in peace! Why are a few of them as heavy as some of the guns?</p>
<p>I hope you like rats…as there can be swarms. Vicious, hungry, screeching swarms of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12934600221732033233gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12934600221732033233gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully again due to the dynamic nature of the game, you might at times come across a roaming friendly patrol to help you deal with them, or use as your distraction meat-shield.</p>
<p>I'll also take this moment to say screw these guys and their stupidly annoying telekinesis that picks up guns, fires them at you and steals your gun away from you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17694670001732033341gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17694670001732033341gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Say cheese! Still smiling at me after death, annoying little thing.</em></p>
<p>There's some other bouncy little critters that can also go to hell, that make me jump every time they make an appearance and I'm not expecting them. But I won't spoil those. You can just <em>enjoy</em> meeting them for yourselves.</p>
<p>Even though the world is huge, there is (thankfully) a form of fast-travel. Much like the game world though, it’s on the punishing side, as it will cost you a bit every time you decide to use it. However, it can be incredibly useful too. If you’re stocked up on loot and want to get to your stash, or to a different area to sell it and carry on with more quests, it can be beneficial anyway to find a guide to initiate fast-travel so you don’t lose anything on the road. I can’t count the number of times I died to a random creature, then bandits appearing and finally losing it to an anomaly with loot on me. Thankfully, I quick-save as much as I breathe but still, you get the point.</p>
<p>The quest system is dynamic too, and at least a little smart. You can build up quite a lot of quests, and there’s various ways of doing each of them differently. Some of them can be completed with a shotgun to the face of a particular person, but that person might give you other options. Shooting first, questions later is not always the best option, but sometimes it’s also just fun to do so you can loot everyone in a particular location. If you’re allowed to kill a particular quest giver, they’ll have the items you need on them. Other times, a quest giver might have been killed by someone, or something, and they’ll all show up in your Failed Quest list.</p>
<p>Another big issue to deal with are powerful emissions. They’re insane crazy storms that turn the sky red, with lightning everywhere and staying outside during one is 100% guaranteed death. You do get a fair bit of warning when one is coming, but even so, getting to shelter fast can still be an issue. Nearly everything in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 wants you dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4233058491732047350gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4233058491732047350gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I haven't even gotten a chance yet to talk about the story, which I won't spoil, because it would be so easy to do so. It revolves around a particular item that gets taken from you, and your main initial quest to try and find it and who was involved. This of course leads onto various other intertwining stories, and things spiral a fair bit from there and it gets…weird.</p>
<p>Dealing with various gangs and different factions along the way. It's exciting even from the moment you load it up, with an impressive intro to the game. Even though the story is interesting as it expands, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is very much about <em>everything else</em>. Plenty of the individual quests you do, along with their story progression, are really fun as they unfold. Backed up by some great voice acting, I especially liked the blind brainwashed preacher when you meet the remnants of the Monolith organisation, and a particular mind-controlling "boss battle" of sorts that took me a good few attempts to get right.</p>
<p>As always, every experience you have depends on your equipment, you really will want to constantly be sorting through what you have and swapping things around depending on your currently picked quest-line.</p>
<p><em>Hope you like FPS platforming too because there's a bit of that spread throughout the game.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8057729621732050516gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8057729621732050516gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With a game like this, I'm really only scratching the surface. I need to go back through and play more, to try out making some different decisions. You do get to make a few interesting choices as you play, and so I'm keen to see what the real difference is when you treat a faction differently.</p>
<h4><strong>Bugs and Technical Issues</strong></h4>
<p>In my time in the game I’ve seen a fair amount of bugs. Just to give you a full idea of what to expect that I’ve come across: objects falling through the world, annoyingly at times I needed them too (darn ammo and meds); dead bodies that spring back up in some sort of T pose and then flop back down again; characters that at times seem to do a mini-teleport and guns that fire without a sound at all. Others like: bodies you can’t get close enough to move, that end up blocking your way in certain situations; I’ve seen NPCs with legs going through the floor in buildings; NPCs that walk on top of objects and just stare point-blank at walls; NPCs walking on the spot never going anywhere and then just vanishing; various NPCs that aren't even close to the floor (or the bed) and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5147835951732033476gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5147835951732033476gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>During my run I've also seen one of the single <em>funniest</em> bugs I’ve ever seen in a game. I was at an enemy base, sneaking around, got discovered and so an enemy started firing at me. I shot them, and then they just suddenly started wildly spinning, and then their body took off like a helicopter and just carried on spinning going up and up and up. The physics system can be pretty <em>hilarious</em>. This ended up happening multiple times too.</p>
<p>Radio chatter audio is even a problem too. When you get a call it often flicks between radio-style sounding one sentence, to chatting like they're right next to you and back again. Thoroughly odd.</p>
<p>Objects NPCs are wearing don’t always line up correctly too, like a particular discussion where their headphones and tape player move without them and the camera ends up focusing on that as you move around. Hilarious again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10259717461732033435gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10259717461732033435gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Saved games act <em>oddly</em> too. I assume due to the dynamic nature of the game, but the AI seems to just make things up when you reload the game. Numerous times I’ve saved somewhat close to enemies, reloaded and they’re suddenly looking for me even when they weren’t before or they know exactly where I am and start shooting. Their position seems to <em>shift</em> during save reloading, as does their behaviour. I gave advice earlier to “save early, save often” and you’ll need it, because this issue has caused me to load earlier saves more times than I can remember.</p>
<p>None of the problems actually stopped me enjoying it for the most part, some even just made me laugh, but yeah — there’s definitely a fair amount of bugs there. I’m honestly surprised at how many. Some do end up breaking the game, like quests that don’t go through properly causing you to reload an earlier save.</p>
<p>A fair amount of flickering textures too in <em>some</em> places, which might be issues with it running with Proton on Linux. So I’ll give it some allowance there until we know more after release. Example video:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10836592101732104709gol1.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p>That flickering is only in a select few places, but very distracting when it happens.</p>
<p>One major graphical issue I came across, that I’ve <em>never</em> ever seen before in <em>any</em> other game, is that I had to completely disable adaptive sync directly in my <em>monitor</em> control panel. Otherwise, lots of light sources would have some insane flicker. Took me ages to figure out what that cause was. But I’ve not had to do that for any other game.</p>
<p>It's clear the game is coming in hot, with plenty of bugs still to be worked through. There's been patches during the review period, some fixes I may not have seen yet, but still many issues to be found during testing even on release day showing many.</p>
<p>Quite stable though, surprisingly so, only a single hard-crash to desktop in my entire run.</p>
<h4><strong>To sum up</strong></h4>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has been equal parts mesmerising as it has been terrifying at the same time. There’s been lots of moments where I’ve just sat and watched something happen, to the times where something has made me jump so fiercely that I threw my mouse across my desk. Some of the encounters really can end up quite <em>frightful</em>, but other times I’ve been just amazed by things happening around me. However, all the bugs can definitely be really <em>frustrating</em> to deal with.</p>
<p>My main concern with it aside from the many bugs is the performance on Linux (and just performance in general), you clearly need some power and without Frame Generation it’s pretty rough. Apart from that, and speaking overall, my time spent with it for the most part has been thoroughly good fun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11797481641732033789gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11797481641732033789gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If I could compare it to previous experiences, it was like the first time I jumped into and completed the original Dying Light or Fallout 3. Worlds full of seemingly endless possibilities, that’s truly never dull to load up a save and explore, and you don’t necessarily need to stick to the storyline if you want to just keep exploring and discovering. There’s hours and hours of content here to discover. But also a whole <strong>lot</strong> of <em>jankiness</em>, so expect plenty of patches to come.</p>
<p>With the mod support, I really cannot wait to see what people cook up to add into it. I feel like this is going to be a game that has a very-long shelf-life that people will be playing for years to come. Add into that the multiplayer they’re promising that will come “soon after release” as a free addition, I have zero doubts that it’s going to be popular.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique gameplay built on a blend of FPS, horror, and immersive sim.</li>
<li>It is a non-linear story, with a variety of paths that lead to one of the several endings.</li>
<li>Benchmark-setting graphics developed using cutting-edge photogrammetry and scanning technologies.</li>
<li>Advanced artificial intelligence systems that will keep engaged even the most hard-boiled players.</li>
<li>Immersive survival mechanics like hunger, sleeping, bleeding, radiation effects that enrich the gameplay.</li>
<li>Dynamic day-night cycle and weather will add even more realism to the gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Mod support gives the freedom to the creative stalker to extend and enrich the game universe.</li>
<li>Multiplayer mode, will be added after release as a free update.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game goes live to purchase at 4PM UTC.</p>

<p>“It feels utterly surreal to say that, but after more than 7 years in the making, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is now released. That’s totally wild. So was the whole development story. What started as the most ambitious game by GSC eventually turned out to be an ultimate personal challenge. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was always supposed to be a truly Ukrainian product, showing our culture to the world in the ongoing effort of the nation to be recognized. I truly believe the team we have consists of exceptional people, but I never actually thought they would be finishing the game under the circumstances like these. Despite all the odds, it’s there. Our biggest game, our own story, our love letter to Ukraine. All the time, effort and passion we put into this is about to be witnessed by the players from all around the globe. After 15 years, the doors to the Zone will be opened once again”, — says Ievgen Grygorovych, CEO and Game Director.</p>

      <title>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa confirms Sony sent an &#39;initial letter of intent&#39; to acquire them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/sony-reportedly-looking-to-acquire-kadokawa-owner-of-elden-ring-dev-fromsoftware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I covered</a> that Kadokawa, the owner of ELDEN RING developer FromSoftware, were potentially being acquired by Sony and now Kadokawa have confirmed there's something going on.</p>
<p>No decision has been made yet though. Before you go jumping to conclusions. In a press <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material7/240956/00.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release</a> issued via their <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, they issued a brief statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some articles on the acquisition of KADOKAWA Corporation (hereinafter "the Company") by<br/>
Sony Group Inc. However, this information is not announced by the Company. The Company has received an<br/>
initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time. If there are<br/>
any facts that should be announced in the future, we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate<br/>
manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now at least we know the previous report is correct, but we'll have to wait on their decision.</p>
<p>If the deal goes through this really will be a huge deal in the world of video games since Kadokawa control FromSoftware (ELDEN RING, <em>ARMORED CORE), </em>Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO), ACQUIRE Corp. (OCTOPATH TRAVELER) and Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker) as well as various Anime and Manga.</p>
<p>Shows you how big this deal is that they had to put out a statement to clarify things, and that nothing has happened just yet.</p>

      <title>Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Greece lands December 4, SCS continue updating legacy art assets for both truck sims</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software have announced that Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Greece is set for release on December 4th. Plus, they're continuing to update the visuals for both Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2024/11/under-hood-reimagining-legacy-assets.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> the developers gave a little background info on their rework of various art assets used in both games noting that: "Since the release of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, the processing power of personal computers has made some serious advancements. In turn, we've continually brought updates to both our titles to introduce new technology and techniques, which has allowed us to introduce higher levels of visual fidelity to our content."</p>
<p>Thanks to the work from two team members they're going through "enhancing the quality and optimization of game models that have started to look outdated and inconsistent with newer additions". Nice to see they continue updating the game for everyone, on top of all the various newer location DLC.</p>
<p>On that note, Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Greece arrives December 4th, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TnstEfkCYFM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42f912db843c6109727d3e41dc1fc52d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TnstEfkCYFM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Greece DLC as you can imagine adds a lot of new areas to explore, but SCS said it's more than just that. It introduces hotel complexes and vibrant cotton farms as new depots as well. <em>Might have to dust off my wheel soon…</em></p>
<p>12 years after release, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has some impressive numbers seeing a peak player count of 36,919 in the last 24 hours. Not many games are able to do that.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>ROSE is a free rogue-lite arena shooter where you sacrifice your body parts to progress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A free game to play midweek? Why not eh? You really should check out ROSE, a violent rogue-lite arena shooter where you sacrifice your body parts to progress and gain new weapons and abilities. Developer Zakroutil launched it free on Steam, with an optional donation DLC on November 18th.</p>
<p>I'm really surprised this is free, it's actually really good! You go through waves of enemies across various different arenas full of traps, and when you defeat a wave you can choose to sacrifice a body part which gives you a debuff, that you can later use to give yourself a big boost when you've sacrificed enough. A pretty clever game mechanic that really makes runs feel quite exciting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ORnCVVdnJ4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86cf76ee88dda5d16bcfecf82ff2b915.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ORnCVVdnJ4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sacrifice your flesh and blood to progress.</li>
<li>Reverse sacrifices to gain boosts instead.</li>
<li>Unlock and upgrade unique weapons.</li>
<li>Slaughter waves of demented enemies.</li>
<li>Defeat titanic bosses.</li>
<li>Progress through the randomized arenas to uncover the dark story.</li>
<li>Avoid traps and other procedurally placed obstacles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Properly weird, unique and terribly good fun. Difficult as hell though, with the speed of it and all the different types of insane enemies that come after you. Some can even latch onto you to keep hurting you. It's a visually wild experience that's for sure.</p>
<p>It works great on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>

<p>The Steam page at least has Linux system requirements in a tab, although it's "TBD" (to be decided) so it might even get Linux support. Otherwise, there's always Proton. Will be keeping an eye on it.</p>

      <title>Steam Controller 2 is apparently a thing and being &#39;tooled for a mass production&#39; plus a new VR controller</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Take this with a pinch of salt as you always do with leaks, but it appears Valve may be prepping a Steam Controller 2, along with a new controller for their Deckard VR kit as well.</p>
<p>News about this comes from <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a> on X, who has covered a lot of Valve leaks for upcoming VR hardware in the past who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Codename for Steam Controller 2 is “Ibex”</p>
<p>Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)</p>
<p>Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wondering where the name Roy for the Deckard VR headset comes from, it seem Valve really love <em>Blade Runner</em> references with <em>Rick Deckard</em> and <em>Roy Batty</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, according to Lynch in <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another</a> post, the Deckard Roy controller has quite a lot of inputs on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve Roy controller(s) have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap</p>
<p>I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named</p>
<p>There is also an unreleased OpenXR extension for these controllers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1856871543684436415" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">might</a> even get some eye-tracking in the Deckard headset.</p>
<p>Long time readers of GamingOnLinux will know that this nearly made my heart explode, because I'm a die-hard fan of the original Steam Controller. I even wrote about my continued love of it in a little article <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/confessing-my-continued-love-of-the-steam-controller-a-few-years-after-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2019</a>. So the news of a potential new and updated one really has me excited.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Just two things I want from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two thumbsticks in addition to the trackpads.</li>
<li>Better battery placement, because the original is a nightmare to get batteries out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously Valve won't confirm any leaks, we'll just have to wait and see what it all turns out to be.</p>
<p>What makes me truly curious on the Steam Controller 2 is just — why? The original was done along with the Steam Machines and Steam Link. While we do have the Steam Deck now, it has been out for years already , and Steam Input works great with tons of different controllers, so why would Valve be again making their own? Just because they can? Because it might sell well for all the people docking the Steam Deck that want a dedicated controller? Or perhaps we might finally see Valve decide to make another attempt at a true home-console like Steam Machine?</p>
<p>You can bet I'll be first in line to buy one either way. <em>I'll be pushing you all out of my way to get it. </em></p>
<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 550.135 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While NVIDIA continues working on new features for their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nvidia-565-57-01-beta-has-wayland-and-hdr-improvements-plus-dxvk-and-vkd3d-optimizations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">565 Beta series</a>, and they have their current <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/nvidia-stable-driver-560-35-03-released-for-linux-with-wayland-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new-feature branch 560.35.03</a>, they also have the slightly older and stable version that just updated to version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/236036/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.135</a>.</p>
<p>The main highlights / changes in this release are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In Linux kernel 6.11, drm_fbdev_generic was renamed to drm_fbdev_ttm.Use drm_fbdev_ttm when present to keep supporting direct frame buffer access needed for Wayland compositors to present content on newer kernels.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. The driver now supports enumerating modes on hotplug events through the DRM fbdev API.</li>
<li>Updated the kernel module build process to use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT from the Linux kernel's Kconfig to detect the compiler used to build the kernel. This may help select the correct compiler on systems where the kernel was built with a compiler other than the default one.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented kernel modules linked using precompiled kernel interface files from loading on recent Debian systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a stable driver, you should be fine to upgrade without issues. I imagine most of you gaming are likely at least on the 560 series that I covered previously. For this 550 series though NVIDIA describes it as: "This driver meets the quality levels applied to Windows drivers that pass testing in Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), therefore providing the same attention to driver reliability, robustness, and performance for non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux)".</p>

<p>It's not clear if this is via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> or a Native Linux version.

      <title>Hotloop is a twin-stick shooter where you fling yourself around using gravity from planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some fresh twin-stick shooting fun? Hotloop looks like a nice one, with an interesting gravity mechanic to throw your ship around using gravity from various planets.</p>
<p>More: "It is a dynamic mix of old school arcade and simulation. In this game you will meet a realistic system of spacecraft behaviour and precise orbital mechanics. You have to curb the force of gravity and learn how to use it to your advantage in order to repel numerous enemies."</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8913s_0CKLo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47ea7a2b0660a6297b97341e265eea30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8913s_0CKLo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A game where you use the environment directly to defeat enemies by smashing them into asteroids, make them burn up in the sun, fall into a black hole and more. All while you're trying to keep yourself moving, with the pull of various celestial bodies. With the fuel mechanic, you'll need to make great use of gravity to keep some spare.</p>
<p>Various different types of weapons and utilities and it just looks like some good classic fun.</p>
<p>The developer also noted just recently they did some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2253660/view/6855136062298128798" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improvements</a> for Steam Deck players too including tweaking the UI and input updates, plus it has a Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>Sony reportedly looking to acquire Kadokawa, owner of ELDEN RING dev FromSoftware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, Sony are currently in talks to buy Kadokawa Corporation, the owner of ELDEN RING developer FromSoftware. They also made Armored Core, Dark Souls and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</p>
<p>Seems like a purchase that would make sense for Sony. Kadokawa are a big name in both Anime and Manga publishing, and with Sony owning Crunchyroll (and Funimation) it would help them expand it even more. Kadokawa also own some huge names in the industry including Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa), Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker) and various others.</p>
<p>Reuters said "Sony declined to comment. Kadokawa said it cannot comment." but according to their sources a deal might be signed as soon as a few weeks time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If Sony do acquire them, this could have a big effect industry-wide. For PC releases, it <em>could</em> even mean seeing more games end up requiring the PlayStation Network account system. That would make sense, as Sony keep pushing that with more recent games, and acquiring more companies to push it even further would also align with their plans to bring more players into their system.</p>

      <title>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth gets online co-op in the latest update with Repentance+ </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available in Beta for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, is the new The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+ update that brings online co-op.</p>
<p>You need to own <u>all</u> the DLC for it, and they're classing it as a Beta for now while they refine it and squash remaining bugs. Additionally, as far as I know, while the base game has Linux support you <em>need</em> <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to run this because the Repentance DLC is only supported on Windows.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j7yPmbNCP4I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22049dac596d2e756b0825c371ed43cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j7yPmbNCP4I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Online play supports all game modes, all achievements that you get in solo can be earned while playing online but overall there's a few differences from solo play as they detailed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/7119722540407193807" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online play has a few differences from solo play. Defeated bosses will drop an item for each player in the match. If a match is joined in progress, the new player will be granted several items to catch them up based on how far along the run is. Players can spend coins at the revive machine in the starting room of each floor to bring back dead players. Be warned, however, that the cost goes up each time the machine is used. Defeating a boss at the end of the stage will also revive any dead players. There might be some other special things to discover online as well!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to note is that mods are not supported to play online, you need to disable any mods.</p>
<p>Did they change anything for solo players? Yes, lots. There's various item improvements and reworks, plus many general quality of life fixes and bug fixes. It's a big update overall.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem like GOG have the update yet, so stick to Steam if you want all the goodies.</p>

      <title>Arcane Wilds is a western-themed fantasy RTS now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now in Early Access, Arcane Wilds gives a slightly different take on the base-building RTS genre and comes with Linux support.</p>
<p>Not only is the setting quite interesting with the blending of themes, but the way it handles resources is a fun one. Resources you gather actually remain at the gathering sites, needing direct transportation for you to be able to use them. This means you can actually steal resources from opponents, requiring each player to properly protect them. It also has a special online co-op survival mode too which sounds pretty fun.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XocajfH1DDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41fc2cd7e4ced618b82d3831240efc3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XocajfH1DDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Three very different factions too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Army: Boasting a powerful arsenal, the Army faction excels in ranged combat with essence-powered cannons, compensating for their low mobility with exceptional firepower.</li>
<li>Colony: Comprising a motley crew of gunslingers, the Colony faction employs explosive barrels and rapid-firing gatling guns, creating a versatile force on the battlefield.</li>
<li>Tribe: Known for their agility and adaptability, the Tribe faction utilizes movable structures and chaos-inducing abilities from medicine men and shamans to wreak havoc among enemies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some fun modding capabilities too with "first-class scripting support with Lua" they say so players can make their own maps and game modes, with Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Lukas Frischknecht, founder of Avancadia, says: "We poured our energy and development expertise into creating Arcane Wilds. We’re confident that Arcane Wilds will give RTS fans an experience they’ve never had before and give the genre a much-needed freshen-up."</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White and Steam Deck Australia have launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big things have arrived. The first is that you can attempt to grab the sleek looking Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White right now, and the Steam Deck is now available in Australia.</p>
<p>The new Limited Edition White costs £599 / $679 and has the same specifications as the 1TB OLED. Although, you do get an exclusive Limited Edition White carrying case, startup movie, and virtual keyboard theme. Valve said they've "allocated stock proportionally across all regions, and restricting purchases to 1 unit per account" and that to purchase your account "must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 and be in good standing".</p>
<p>Once it's gone, it's gone. So if you're somehow still on the fence, now might be the best time to get one of the coolest-looking models.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20287088481731971816gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Australia also joins then list of supported regions for the Steam Deck officially now too. Prices for Australia are:</p>
<ul>
<li>256GB LCD: $649.00 AUD</li>

      <title>Single-player survival horror game Sorry We&#39;re Closed out now and should work great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

Check out the release trailer below:</p>

      <title>Devs of chill arcade freeriding game SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding use the Steam Deck as their performance target</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding is a recent discovery that looks wonderful. A chill arcade freeriding game where it's just you against the raw wilderness and they plan to have it working to perfection on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They're using the Steam Deck as their performance target and optimizing directly against it. As detailed in a recent Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2943150/announcements/detail/6491470391966433407" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, that follows on from an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2943150/view/6491470391966433298" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">earlier</a> post about hitting their smooth 60FPS goal, the Steam Deck as a target means it will run smoothly on a lot of "normal" PCs.</p>
<p>How? As they briefly explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The how is a bit more complicated, but the short of it was that we generate and spawn in new terrain continuously as you ski down the mountain. Our terrain generation algorithm isn't super heavy, but heavy enough that when we ran it on the main thread of the CPU you could easily drop down to 40-50 frames, and in very dense areas even lower perhaps. The solution? Multithreading and parallel processing for calculating the terrain, as well as spacing out spawning of objects. This got rid of 99% of stutter, and the last pieces was some graphics optimization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of their work, as they showed in two small GIFs, is that the performance on Steam Deck went from 30FPS and below (a bit all over the place) to a clear smooth 60FPS. Very nice.</p>

<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now. It doesn't have a full release date yet.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK v2.5.1 released fixing GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition and an anisotropic filtering regression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the rather large <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/direct3d-to-vulkan-translation-layer-dxvk-v25-released-with-rewritten-memory-management/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DXVK 2.5 update a week ago</a>, a smaller bug-fix release is out now for the Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer used by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. The projects works with Direct3D 8/9/10/11.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the main changes included in the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.5.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DXVK 2.5.1</a> release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a major regression where anisotropic filtering would not work correctly in D3D9 games. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4452" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4452</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed some build issues with dxvk-native. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4446</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed some build issues with recent versions of clang. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4467" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4467</a>)</li>
<li>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition: Work around a crash when HDR is enabled. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4450" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4450</a>)<br/>
	Note: Since these games use Unreal Engine 4, HDR is unsupported in D3D11 mode.</li>

<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>
