      <title>Yuzu agrees to pay Nintendo $2.4 million and will entirely shut down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/nintendo-goes-after-switch-emulator-yuzu-in-new-lawsuit/" target="_blank">recently filed</a> a lawsuit against the Yuzu team, it was pretty much inevitable this was going to happen wasn't it. <em>The end of Yuzu is officially here.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo and Tropic Haze LLC (Yuzu) filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.56980/gov.uscourts.rid.56980.10.0.pdf" target="_blank">joint motion</a> for the court to enter Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction, so as I understand it's not quite final until the judge stamps it.</p>
<p>As a result the Yuzu team have announced their intention to shut <em>everything</em> down, and have agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4M USD in damages. As per the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.56980/gov.uscourts.rid.56980.10.1.pdf" target="_blank">other document</a>, Yuzu will also transfer the <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org" target="_blank">domain name</a> used over to Nintendo and they have agreed to delete <em>every single thing</em> related to Yuzu that they have.</p>
<p>Writing in the yuzu Discord (and <a href="https://twitter.com/yuzuemu/status/1764733659444064671" target="_blank">posted</a> on X) the developer bunnei said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello yuz-ers and Citra fans:</p>
<p>We write today to inform you that yuzu and yuzu’s support of Citra are being discontinued, effective immediately.</p>
<p>yuzu and its team have always been against piracy. We started the projects in good faith, out of passion for Nintendo and its consoles and games, and were not intending to cause harm. But we see now that because our projects can circumvent Nintendo’s technological protection measures and allow users to play games outside of authorized hardware, they have led to extensive piracy. In particular, we have been deeply disappointed when users have used our software to leak game content prior to its release and ruin the experience for legitimate purchasers and fans.</p>
<p>We have come to the decision that we cannot continue to allow this to occur. Piracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and on video game consoles should end. Effective today, we will be pulling our code repositories offline, discontinuing our Patreon accounts and Discord servers, and, soon, shutting down our websites. We hope our actions will be a small step toward ending piracy of all creators’ works.</p>
<p>Thank you for your years of support and for understanding our decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering it's open source though, and has been out in the wild for some time now, it's unlikely this is <em>truly</em> the end because it's been so widely circulated. However, it will make it a lot harder for anyone seeking it out, and no doubt put off anyone from doing anything with Yuzu code they might still have.</p>
<p>For now, the <a href="https://ryujinx.org" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a> project at least still exists and as far as I know hasn't had Nintendo come knocking — yet.</p>

      <title>Sunshine game streaming v0.22.0 adds HDR on Linux, Wayland + NVIDIA improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sunshine along with Moonlight are popular ways to run your own game streaming system (as say an alternative to Steam Remote Play), and the latest Sunshine release sounds great for Linux gamers.</p>
<p>You would use Sunshine to host the stream, like on a good PC, and then run Moonlight on the system you wish to actually play the game on. Moonlight for example works on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS and more. It does take some setup, but when going it can be vastly better than other solutions and it's open source.</p>
<p>In the latest release of Sunshine v0.22.0 there's some nice additions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Input/Linux) Add native/pen touch support for Linux.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Add HDR streaming support for Linux using KMS capture backend.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Add KMS capture support for Nvidia GPUs running Wayland.</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Add Fedora 39 docker image and rpm package.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Display monitor indexes in logs for wlroots and KMS capture backends.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Improve VAAPI encoding performance on Intel GPUs.</li>
<li>(Linux) Updated desktop files.</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Optionally, allow using the system installation of wayland-protocols.</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Make vaapi optional.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17559160191709559259gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17559160191709559259gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p>And then some nice bug fixes for Linux too:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix missing mouse cursor when using KMS capture on a GPU with hardware cursor support.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix GL errors or corrupt video output on GPUs that use aux planes such as Intel Arc.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix GL errors or corrupt video output on GPUs that use DRM modifiers on YUV buffers.</li>
<li>(Input/Linux) Fix scrolling in applications that don't support high-resolution scrolling.</li>
<li>(Input/Linux) Fix absolute mouse input being interpreted as touch input.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix wlroots capture causing GL errors and crashes.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix wlroots capture failing when the display scale factor was not 1.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix excessive CPU usage when using wlroots capture backend.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix capture of virtual displays created by the amdgpu kernel driver.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix corrupt video output or stream disconnections if the display resolution changes while streaming.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix color of aspect ratio padding in the capture image with VAAPI.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix NVENC initialization error when using X11 capture with some GPUs.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Replace vaTerminate method with dl handle.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix capture when DRM is enabled and x11 is disabled.</li>
<li>(Tray/Linux) Fix random crash when the tray icon is updating.</li>
<li>(Linux) Use XDG spec for fetching config directory.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine pulls in code to eliminate a Vulkan performance issue for wow64</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is about to get just that little bit sweeter, with new code recently merged into the project that should work around a performance issue with Vulkan. Specifically it relates to how Wine was previously implementing wow64, a way of supporting 32-bit applications on 64bit.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5128" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> titled "winevulkan: Use VK_EXT_map_memory_placed for memory mapping on wow64" that was accepted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the new extension, we may implement wow64 correctly, without <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_external_memory_host</code> hacks. This is both more correct and more performant (essentially eliminating Vulkan wow64 performance penalty).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_map_memory_placed.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_map_memory_placed</a> extension was released with Vulkan 1.3.278 spec update on February 16, 2024. The extension "allows a client to request that <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkMapMemory2KHR.html" target="_blank">vkMapMemory2KHR</a> attempt to place the memory map at a particular virtual address" and was worked on by Collabora, AMD, NVIDIA, Valve and CodeWeavers.</p>
<p>So once all graphics drivers are released with support for it, and Wine gets a release with it in (along with any needed Proton updates), it should work that little bit better.</p>

      <title>Steam smashes its peak players online record to over 34 million</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starting 2024 off strong, Valve has seen Steam smash the all-time record once again for users actually online showing that weekends are a busy time for gamers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the record of 34,649,583 people online was hit Sunday, March 3rd at 2PM UTC and at the time 11,146,564 players were actually in game too. Steam has been regularly hitting over 33 million since January, but managed to first hit over 34 million on Saturday, March 2nd and then smashed the record again on Sunday.</p>
<p>Going by the stats the most popular games were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Helldivers 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like 2024 is going to be another massive year for Valve. 2023 was already pretty crazy with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-users-redeemed-over-80-million-in-physical-wallet-cards-in-december-2023/" target="_blank">Steam users redeeming over $80 million in physical wallet cards</a>.</p>

I'm doing my part.</em></p>
<p>What were you playing this weekend? As you might have gathered, I was playing plenty of Helldivers 2. Freedom isn't going to bring itself to the galaxy.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another month down according to Statcounter at least, Linux on the desktop is doing better than ever. Take it with your usual little pinch of salt like any survey sampling though.</p>
<p>We've finally cracked 4%, which for Linux is a pretty big thing. How do they do it? They collect stats from over 1.5 million websites, so they have a pretty good sample size for it.</p>
<p>Here's how things have looked over the last year+</p>
<ul>
<li>January 23 - 2.91%</li>
<li>February 23 - 2.94%</li>
<li>March 23 - 2.85%</li>
<li>April 23 - 2.83%</li>
<li>May 23 - 2.7%</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like once again we're seeing an Asia influx on Steam, as the February 2024 Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey showed a big +7.62% bump in Simplified Chinese. This month also saw a +2.76% rise in Windows 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>As a result this pushed down the totals for both macOS and Linux, which always happens when there's a rise in Simplified Chinese so the overall operating system stats on Steam for February 2024 are:</p>

      <title>Proton 9.0 for Steam Deck / Linux got a small Beta update, plus Proton Experimental too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>All older games being sold in Germany on Steam now require a content rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For game developers that want to continue selling games in Germany, they'll need to ensure they actually have a content rating, including for older games. Hopefully there won't be any disruption, but Steam has a <em>huge</em> amount of games going back a great many years, so there may be a few that get caught-out in this.</p>
<p>Announced in a Steamworks Development <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/4183351393029705362" target="_blank">blog post by Valve</a>, they mentioned both Brazilian and German laws require content ratings for people to find age-appropriate content. However, there's been an ongoing legal debate as to whether that applied to new games only <em>or</em> to the back catalogue of older games too. Now the German regulatory authority BZKJ has "expressed to us their interpretation of the law applies to all games on Steam, including ones that were launched before the law came into effect".</p>
<p>So developers will now need to ensure their games have a rating to continue to be sold in Germany. The good news for developers, is that Steam has its own built-in rating system they can go opt to use, or game devs can go directly through the BZKJ.</p>
<p>For developers that released a game before January 2020, they may not have filled out the questionnaire for Valve's rating system, so they will need to go back and do it for their games.</p>

      <title>Game over for Roblox on Linux / Steam Deck as it&#39;s now blocked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is, the update for Roblox has arrived that now forcefully blocks it from working with Wine on Linux systems (like Steam Deck).</p>
<p>It's been a bit of a saga hasn't it? Roblox has always been somewhat iffy to play on Linux, at times being broken while people working on the likes of <a href="https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice" target="_blank">Grapefruit</a> and <a href="https://vinegarhq.org" target="_blank">Vinegar</a> repeatedly kept up with changes to make it work. The Roblox developers then introduced Hyperion anti-cheat software, although they continued to make it work <em>unofficially</em> with Wine but that wasn't to last as a developer explained <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/we-can-probably-say-a-final-goodbye-to-roblox-on-linux-with-wine-soon/" target="_blank">that it has caused cheating</a>.</p>
<p>Now if you try to run it, you will simply be told "Wine is not supported.":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797727231709299834gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Despite what you may think of Roblox (and it's historically had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" target="_blank">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY" target="_blank">problems</a>) as one of the biggest gaming platforms ever, it's certainly a shame to see it go. There's plenty of people out there that have Roblox as their main thing, and so not being able to do it on Linux is quite a loss.</p>
<p>Any game that intentionally prevents it from working on Linux <em>is</em> a loss as it just increases the uphill battle Linux has as a gaming platform. There's not exactly many accessible alternatives to it for Linux fans.</p>
<p>Know any alternatives for people looking? Let readers know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam had a bit of a scam problem with fakes of Helldivers 2 and Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not the first time it has happened, and likely won't be the last unless Valve implement some more security checks, but recently a few games tried scamming players by renaming into other popular games.</p>
<p>I've seen this a few times now, although it's suddenly coming into focus again because the games being imitated were current massive smash-hits.</p>
<p>The CEO of developer Arrowhead and the Helldivers 2 Creative Director, wrote a <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1763526653467144241" target="_blank">post</a> on X noting that they were aware of store dupes posing as Helldivers 2. There was also a <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1763498651517853709" target="_blank">post</a> on X from the Community Manager at Pocketpair, developer on Palworld, who also spoke about the recent fakers imitating Palworld too. They've now been removed and hidden from the Steam store, but thanks to SteamDB we can go back and look.</p>
<p>A game that was previously called <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2630550/history/" target="_blank">DO NOT SMILE</a> renamed to Helldivers 2, and even changed the publisher and developer to match, it's especially nefarious because the now hidden <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2630550/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank">Steam page</a> clearly looked like it was Helldivers 2. They even copied some of the recent news posts. Another game, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2607830/history/" target="_blank">Figurality</a>, did the exact same thing. Then there's the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2607810/" target="_blank">Stolen Mushrooms</a>, which attempted to be Palworld. <em>There may be others, but those I could find quite easily as examples.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4819635471709296151gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4819635471709296151gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Image from SteamDB</em></p>
<p>As you can see above from the shot of SteamDB, the developer changed basically everything they could to make it seem like their game was Helldivers 2. And when you look at the store page (hidden but still exists) it certainly would look like Helldivers 2 if you weren't properly clued up:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16168351011709296498gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16168351011709296498gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Of course now there's no purchase button since it's been hidden, but you get the idea. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240301063242/store.steampowered.com/app/2630550/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> archive shows it did have purchases available before being hidden by Valve.</em></p>
<p>It seems it's quite easy to do, as apparently Valve don't have checks in place against this. I've reached out to Valve to see if they have any comment to share on what they will do in future to protect developers <em>and</em> customers from scams like this. Quite a concerning issue.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.17 brings lots of bug fixes, plus Persona 3 Reload improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released the latest stable update to SteamOS for Steam Deck, and it includes quite a healthy dose of bug fixes and general improvements.</p>
<p>This is quite the bumper update that includes WiFi fixes, HDR improvements, incorrect gamma when streaming games, multiple performance improvements Persona 3 Reload and many other bug fixes. Nice to see all the recent Beta versions now rolled out for everyone!</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5.17 brings all this from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4124805233776242149" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed black screen when launching Forza Horizon 4 and other titles on Steam Deck OLED.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where modifying settings in the desktop partition manager could prevent the SD card from being mounted and visible in Steam.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in desktop mode where dropping a folder on the desktop would erroneously create a shortcut for every item within the folder.</li>
<li>Fixed crashes when streaming to/from the Deck with Steam Remote Play.</li>
<li>Added a timeout to the boot selection screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a WiFi crash occurring where certain bands would cause the driver to attempt to set an incorrect spatial stream count.</li>
<li>Added a slider to control the brightness of the Status LED (Charger LED). This setting can be found under Settings -&gt; Display.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where WiFi would fail to connect in certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible session crash when connecting an HDR display.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare session crash on application exit.</li>
<li>Improved handling of GPU crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple performance improvements for Persona 3 Reload.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying GPU clock speed as an instantaneous measurement rather than an average, resulting in misleading numbers.
<ul>
<li>This matches behavior of SteamOS 3.4.11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved a situation where a game's frame presentation could block because of buffers submitted by Steam or other windows, removing a potential source of game stutters.</li>
<li>Added an additional frame timing plot to the level four performance overlay. When the frame limiter or vsync is enabled, this shows timings of when frames are flipped to the display, rather than application-side rendering times.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing stutter in certain games that buffer multiple frames in advance.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous compositor performance improvements.</li>
<li>Reduced stutters when the upscale filter was set to FSR or NIS under high GPU load.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue regarding frame-pacing and stutter, especially affecting some external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed display sometimes getting stuck at 60Hz after returning from sleep on the Steam UI.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a core could be stuck at 100% CPU if a game's window closed in an unclean way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HDR on some external DisplayPort displays being slightly desaturated.</li>
<li>Improved gamut mapping for HDR titles on Deck OLED.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain HDR titles wherein wiggling the cursor on the same frame as closing the game would cause incorrect colors in subsequent game launches.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect colors (gamma) when using Steam In-Home Streaming.</li>
<li>Fixed consistency of application fade-ins/fade-outs.</li>
<li>Fixed slightly blurry image when streaming from the Deck with Steam Remote Play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved controller's mouse and keyboard emulation when Steam is not running, including including vertical and horizontal scrolling support on left trackpad.</li>
<li>Added support for the HyperX Clutch Gladiate controllers.</li>
<li>Fixed a system restart when Joy-Con controllers are connected.</li>
<li>Slightly improved corner tracking on Steam Deck OLED trackpads.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with elevated noise levels for trackpad pressure sensors. Affects only certain configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Firmware 120 (LCD) / 107 (OLED)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several USB compatibility issues.</li>
<li>
<p>Developer note:  This changes the default USB mode back to XHCI (host-only) while issues with dual-role device mode are investigated.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Extraction horror shooter Level Zero: Extraction will get Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Level Zero: Extraction is an upcoming extraction horror game with high-stakes asymmetric PvPvPvE and FPS combat, and according to the developer they will add Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Level Zero: Extraction is a multiplayer extraction horror, a unique take on survival experience which blends the heart-pounding tension of asymmetric horrors with the high-stakes showdowns of extraction shooters. Embark on a dangerous scavenging expedition where 3 teams of up to 3 mercenaries compete for loot, and dare to come back. Or take on the role of two deadly alien monsters and hunt for human prey."</p>

<p>In a post on the official Steam forum a user asked if it will be playable on Steam Deck, to which a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1456940/discussions/0/4339851480051269915/#c4339851480053310622" target="_blank">developer replied</a> very clearly to say: "Hey! Yeah, we plan on adding SD support in the future". And of course since it will run with Proton, it will be playable on Desktop Linux too. Looks like it could be a good one to keep an eye on if you're in the mood for more survival shooters like it.</p>

      <title>Single-player extraction shooter ZERO Sievert adds controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZERO Sievert is a top-down pixel-art single-player survival shooter from CABO Studio and Modern Wolf, and now it should be a lot nicer on Steam Deck or Desktop PCs with controllers.</p>
<p>It already worked quite well with Proton 8 on Linux, but it wasn't great on Steam Deck due to the lack of controller support. That's much less of a problem as of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1782120/view/4123679333853656818" target="_blank">latest update</a> as it adds full controller support to all actions, plus various parts of the UI were updated to work properly with it and just be more intuitive overall. The developer also said clearly they're now working towards making the game fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Testing it on Steam Deck myself it is vastly better, although the new controller support takes some getting used to, and some bits are a little tricky it's now properly playable.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YN0tFfx72uU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72efe24c759901d7366c292f16f4dda4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YN0tFfx72uU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer also improved inventory sorting, AI combat is more realistic with weapon recoil, no more insane accuracy leading to your death. Overall, a pretty great update for an already incredibly fun game.</p>
<p>Seems like loading time and performance has improved a lot since I last played it too, it's looking really good now.</p>
<p>Available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782120/ZERO_Sievert/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The HDMI Forum rejected AMD&#39;s open source HDMI 2.1 implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you were hoping at some point to see HDMI 2.1+ on Linux with AMD + Mesa, you're out of luck right now as it's simply not going to be happening.</p>
<p>There's been a bug report on the Mesa GitLab of "<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417" target="_blank">4k@120hz unavailable via HDMI 2.1</a>" that's been open for a few years now, with lots of comments and chatter about the issue. The problem is that HDMI is a proprietary interface, whereas DisplayPort is run by the international non-profit VESA, so it's much more complicated for HDMI support.</p>
<p>In an update on the bug report, AMD engineer Alex Deucher <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2303163" target="_blank">commented</a>: "The HDMI Forum has rejected our proposal unfortunately.  At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements."</p>
<p>So if you're on Linux, it's going to continue to be best to buy hardware that uses DisplayPort.</p>
<p>On the NVIDIA side though, it seems like it <em>may</em> not be an issue, as developer Karol Herbst wrote on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@karolherbst@chaos.social/112014061485741219" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>: "Even though AMD might not be able to add support for HDMI 2.1, nouveau certainly will as Nvidia's open source driver _also_ supports HDMI 2.1 so there is no reason to believe that at least some drivers can't support HDMI 2.1</p>
<p>It's quite backwards, but apparently having all the logic inside firmware (like Nvidia does) will probably help us implementing support for HDMI 2.1"</p>
<p>So perhaps in future AMD may be able to do something similar with their firmware.</p>

      <title>Open-source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA hardware in Mesa, NVK, is now ready for prime time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The future of NVIDIA hardware on Linux is here with the open source Vulkan driver NVK in Mesa, as there's now a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27832" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to have it shipped by default. Once approved and merged into Mesa, this should then ship with the Mesa 24.1 release due out hopefully at the start of May.</p>
<p>NVK is also now a conformant Vulkan 1.3 driver on Turing (RTX 2000 and GTX 1600 series), Ampere (RTX 3000 series), and Ada (RTX 4000 series) GPUs. From developer Faith Ekstrand in the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-is-now-ready-for-prime-time.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, "Not only have we jumped forward three Vulkan versions, but the new test runs were done with the GSP firmware enabled and includes Ampere and Ada GPUs. Also, unlike the initial 1.0 run, there are no hacks this time. Every test we passed in those conformance test runs also passes on upstream Mesa".</p>
<p>Ekstrand also mentioned lots of work went into ensuring DXVK (part of Proton for D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 to Vulkan) would run completely out of the box with Mesa, and work continues on D3D12 to Vulkan work via VKD3D-Proton. </p>
<p>Additionally, the OpenGL support, they're still expecting Zink + NVK to be the plan, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/nvidia-open-source-driver-to-use-nvk-zink-for-opengl-on-newer-gpus/" target="_blank">as noted in our previous article</a>. Because it's much more performant than the old original nouveau OpenGL driver and should keep improving too on features, performance and stability.</p>
<p>So in later distribution releases, you should hopefully get access to it out of the box with no configuration required if you have an NVIDIA GPU that's currently supported.</p>
<p>What a great time for open source. Fantastic work by all involved in this project.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes Remote Play on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently releasing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/valve-release-big-stable-steam-client-update-for-steam-steam-deck/" target="_blank">big Stable Steam Client update</a> for Steam Deck and Desktop PCs, I highlighted that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/remote-play-broken-on-steam-deck-with-the-february-stable-update/" target="_blank">Remote Play was broken on Steam Deck</a> - and so Valve has now fixed it.</p>
<p>Initially putting out a quick Beta update, and then <em>very</em> shortly after putting it into Stable so all users will be able to update now and have working Remote Play. I've tested it across a couple titles from my desktop Linux PC to the Steam Deck, and yup — visual, audio and input are all working properly with no more infinite Steam loading screen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4124805233776542002" target="_blank">changelog</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the 'Verifying Installation' message incorrectly showing on every startup.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed infinite loading animation when streaming from another PC</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Valve get such a big feature fixed up, still a shame to see the initial update rolled out with it broken though. So hopefully checks will be done to prevent this in future.</p>
<p>This is great, as Remote Play is such an incredibly useful feature for when you want to run some bigger games smoother on Steam Deck and you have a PC, so you can sit somewhere super comfortable and just stream it instead of sitting at a desk.</p>

      <title>5 years later Valve finally gives Windows compatibility tool Proton a logo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can you believe it? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, the compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Steam Deck / Linux PCs didn't actually have a proper logo for over 5 years.</p>
<p>Not everything actually <em>needs</em> a logo of course, but it did feel somewhat odd for a piece of software so essential to Valve's plans to just be completely blank on that. With all the entries of Proton in Steam just showing up blank with their name and version, it was about time Valve made it at least a tiny bit <em>prettier</em> don't you think?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7085450281709146217gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Proton logo - Valve</em></p>
<p>Proton has been around <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" target="_blank">since August 2018</a>! 5 and a half years! Hard to imagine trying to game on Linux without it now, it's so incredibly useful and just amazing tech. The Steam Deck obviously wouldn't have been such a success without it, and it's crazy to think the original Steam Machines launched as they did with so few popular games. Proton is a true blessing, enabling tens of thousands of games to work on Linux systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I guess I can finally retire the silly little <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/tagline_gallery/proton.jpg" target="_blank">placeholder</a> logo I threw out a long time ago when I needed <em>something</em> for it. Rest easy my child, your time is over.</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, Valve also recently launched the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-9-now-in-beta-with-improved-game-compatibility-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">first Beta of Proton 9.0</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-experimental-updated-with-proton-9-adds-fixes-for-helldivers-2-and-more/" target="_blank">new Proton Experimental version</a>. Be sure to also read the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/5-years-ago-valve-released-proton-forever-changing-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">overview I did back when Proton turned 5</a> which nicely sums things up.</p>

      <title>Lots more content is coming to Last Epoch and controller support improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch recently released on Steam with Native Linux support, an offline mode and controller support but the developers at Eleventh Hour Games plan to keep improving it all.</p>
<p>In an update posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/4194610392091503963" target="_blank">Steam</a> the developer noted that there's patches due soon for lots of reported issues, and they plan to continue weekly updates to keep fixing up issues and acting on player feedback.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of server issues though, as it was a lot more popular than expected. It's another early 2024 Steam hit, seeing a peak player count of 264,708 players online at the same time 3 days ago. Things are calmer now but it did show up some "unanticipated bottlenecks" in their backend and they said to expect more information later about the cause. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18224783921709140675gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some more good news is that we can expect to see more localization improvements, major content planned for a 1.1 update including more work from player feedback and a "heavy emphasis on expanding end-game content" as they said they are "wholly committed to making the best ARPG in the genre, and listening to our amazing community is a big part of that".</p>
<p>For players on Steam Deck or PC with a gamepad, expect more improvements there. While the 1.0 release had an "immense amount of gamepad updates" they have "a lot of updates coming before 1.1 that will improve the experience even further, including better navigation of certain panels" as they plan to release LE on consoles so they're going to ensure gamepad is a "top notch" experience.</p>

      <title>nullptr is an action puzzle hacking game where every second counts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due to release sometime in Q3 2024, developer Jeferson Silva has recently put up a demo for their action puzzle hacking game nullptr.</p>
<p>A fast paced action puzzle game where you play the role of a hacker. Take down megacorporations by invading their servers, downloading their data and getting out without being detected. Outwit defensive sentry programs and expose the perfect route to access the databases. Once you're connected to one of the servers ports, you have 20 seconds to hack security systems, reprogram the server to evade sentinel programs and download data. Your goal is to find or create safe routes to download all databases in each server without being traced.</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="chUGrRxo2Gk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/720ed83000b546321f3a89bfe2b6ecbb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/chUGrRxo2Gk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This could be a good one for those of you who love puzzle games, and like having your ability to think quickly on your feet tested.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579650/nullptr/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Lots of exciting updates coming to the free &amp; open source RPG Veloren</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Veloren, the free and open source action-adventure role-playing voxel game made in Rust keeps evolving. Since its last public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/multiplayer-voxel-rpg-veloren-v015-is-out-adding-the-first-world-boss/" target="_blank">v0.15 release in July 2023</a>, much has changed and lots of improvements were made so far.</p>
<p>This is a compilation of what is considered important by the core contributors on the game so far:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13106773381709124909gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13106773381709124909gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Discord links and Gitlab merge requests to have bi-directional linking for better tracking of feature requests.</li>
<li>A draft version of a Roadmap was added to Gitlab defining priorities and project focus.</li>
<li>Translation can now be done through <a href="https://translate.codeberg.org/engage/veloren/" target="_blank">Weblate</a>, and it is fully integrated with the project Gitlab.</li>
<li>A branch was created for food diversification so, expect a lot of new foods to be implemented in-game.</li>
<li>Craftable shovels used to dig up mud and graves for loot.</li>
<li>Network Library update.</li>
<li>Locations now available during character selection.</li>
<li>Better cursor locking on Wayland.</li>
<li>Singleplayer map GUI with map selection for easier world selection.</li>
<li>Frost Giga boss rework and testing.</li>
<li>Toolchain update to keep it as compatible as possible with all OSs supported.</li>
<li>Melee, Projectile and Beam attacks benefit on critical by precision when attacking from behind, or partial precision when attacking from sides. Aiming for the head with projectiles can also trigger precision events that will lead to critical hits.</li>
<li>Server configuration settings moved from<code class="inline-code"> server/server_config/settings.ron:metrics_address</code> to <code class="inline-code">server-cli/settings.ron:web_address</code></li>
<li>A merge was made to enable plugin-defined items for those who want to modify the game.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">WGPU</code> added support to OpenGL3.3 so, if you have a more modest PC with no Vulkan support, you might be able to run Veloren, while modern PCs running Vulkan or DirectX 12 will see a slightly increase in performance.</li>
<li>Cliff towns and mesa biomes (those look beautiful),</li>
<li>More potions were added to the game.</li>
<li>Fixes related to armor buffs. </li>
<li>Re-enabling kelp on sea and crustaceous taming. </li>
<li>Wiki tool integration to track drop related data from mobs showing item name, rarity (percentage) and quantity.</li>
<li>Over the shoulder aiming for ranged attacks, customizable in the game settings. This was done because the contributors didn't like the way third person camera handled aiming. This implementation ended up fixing some crosshair issues as well.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8678306741709125315gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8678306741709125315gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it is hard to provide a curated list of everything that was implemented, these are some "minor" implementations that are scattered throughout all the blog updates and reflect the constant maintenance of the project and their continuous effort in making this game awesome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mob related improvements: new mobs, AI, models, code refactor, random bugfixes like "division by zero", item quantity display, animations, pet bugs, etc).</li>
<li>Updates in scenario related stuff (points of interest, outpost, abandoned ruins, vampire castles, terracota ruins, airships, textures, etc).</li>
<li>World generation overall fixes.</li>
<li>Seasonal events like Halloween and Christmas.</li>
<li>Shaders, test on rendering algorithms, faster colour mapping, screenshot conversion optimization, performance optimizations overall.</li>
<li>Loads of translation fixes, group and NPC chat fixes, death message improvements.</li>
<li>Unmerged fixes, which are the ones that might land in game soon or need further testing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6543669351709125393gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6543669351709125393gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Truly amazing how quickly this game is evolving lately and the passion of the contributors to keep improving the game in every aspect.</p>

      <title>Remote Play broken on Steam Deck with the February stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/valve-release-big-stable-steam-client-update-for-steam-steam-deck/" target="_blank">just recently launched</a> a big stable update to the Steam Client for both Steam Deck and Desktop PCs, which has come with one big issue for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems Remote Play on Steam Deck is now broken. Trying to play a game from a Linux or Windows host just results in a spinning Steam logo screen on the Steam Deck. Weirdly, in my testing, the Steam Deck did get audio but no visual or input — the only choice is to press B to exit the stream.</p>
<p>The thing is, this has been a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10461" target="_blank">reported bug</a> since at least February 3rd, when it was noticed from people on the Preview / Beta update channels with multiple confirmed reports.</p>
<p>Hopefully Valve will solve it. Although, other reports have noted that it does work again in the current Release Candidate update available via Developer Options (for the next upcoming major update), which is not meant for any normal users so I <em>wouldn't</em> recommend changing it as enabling the advanced update channels could cause future problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289557211709123917gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289557211709123917gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>A shame to see such a useful feature broken in this way. Hopefully Valve will ensure this feature is fully tested when rolling out future updates to the Steam Deck. Remote Play has always bin a bit iffy in my testing, something with it always seems to be broken but this is the first time I've seen it entirely broken like this.</p>

      <title>The future has arrived - KDE Plasma 6 desktop released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team announced "MegaRelease 6", a big upgrade that includes Plasma 6, Frameworks 6 and Gear 24.02 with tons of improvements to this popular desktop environment that's used on the Steam Deck for Desktop Mode. <em>Hopefully we will see Valve give it an update in the next major SteamOS release.</em></p>
<p>Bringing the future to a desktop near you, the tech under the hood has gone through some <strong>major</strong> upgrades with updates to Qt and Wayland support (with Wayland also now the default). The developers say "We have done our best to ensure that these changes are as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible, so when you install this update, you will see the same familiar desktop environment that you know and love" and that the upgrades "benefit Plasma's security, efficiency, and performance, and improve support for modern hardware".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1228818921709045295gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1228818921709045295gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of big stuff on top of Qt and Wayland upgrades including:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Desktop Overview effect that combines the Overview and Desktop Grid.</li>
<li>Partial support for High Dynamic Range (HDR).</li>
<li>Refreshed Breeze theme.</li>
<li>Improved system settings app to make it more user friendly.</li>
<li>Improved fingerprint unlock from lockscreen.</li>
<li>Plasma Search now lets you customize the ordering of search results. Plus it's faster and performs better.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements to various apps like the popular video editor Kdenlive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and my favourite, the Cube has returned! All hail hypnocube!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1861896241709045623gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1861896241709045623gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of smaller but still useful changes have made it in too, like the controversial single-click to open files and folders has been moved to a double-click which better matches Windows and other desktop environments.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most exciting Plasma updates I've ever seen, and I can't wait to get my Kubuntu install on my desktop upgraded. I'm <em>really</em> keen to see how much Wayland support has improved, and should hopefully properly make it my own default now too.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/" target="_blank">full release page</a> for all the info. There's simply far too many goodies to list here.</p>

      <title>Nintendo goes after Switch emulator yuzu in new lawsuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here we go. Nintendo have formally filed a lawsuit against the creators of the popular open source Switch emulator <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org" target="_blank">yuzu</a>. <em>Nintendo certainly aren't holding back on this one either.</em></p>
<p>Looking over the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/709016504/Nintendo-of-America-Inc-v-Tropic-Haze-LLC-1-24-Cv-00082-No-1-D-R-I-Feb-26-2024" target="_blank">document</a> filed February 26th, Nintendo give an example in their complaint with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom saying that it was "unlawfully distributed a week and a half before its release by Nintendo" and that copies of it were "successfully downloaded from pirate websites over one million times before the game was published and made available for lawful purchase by Nintendo".</p>
<p>A major part of the argument is how Nintendo say that "Yuzu unlawfully circumvents the technological measures on Nintendo Switch games and allows for the play of encrypted Nintendo Switch games on devices other than a Nintendo Switch". Nintendo go on to talk about how yuzu allows working around all the protections they put in place, and that "to be clear, there is no lawful way to use Yuzu to play Nintendo Switch games, including because it must decrypt the games’ encryption".</p>
<p>To work yuzu needs certain things from a Switch console, of which the early models had an exploit where this was possible. The yuzu install guide mentions specifically you need a "HACKABLE Nintendo Switch", which Nintendo argue in the suit that "Users obtain the prod.keys either through unlawful websites or by unlawfully hacking a Nintendo Switch console". Because of how yuzu works Nintendo state it "turns general computing devices into tools for massive intellectual property infringement of Nintendo and others’ copyrighted works".</p>
<p>What's not particularly great for the yuzu team is a quote included in the suit from the project lead Bunnei, where Nintendo quote Bunnei saying "users probably just pirate a yuzu folder with everything" when replying to another user about the Quickstart Guide as it can be confusing for people. For context, this is a quote from the yuzu Discord server, but a follow-up post from another developer mentions directly after it "just to clarify on that last statement, we do not endorse, nor support piracy and the users who do won't receive assistance". Still, it's giving Nintendo easy ammo.</p>
<p>Nintendo are going after damages (which look to be quite high in monies), plus they want the yuzu website domain transferred to Nintendo control and the total shut down of yuzu as a whole.</p>
<p>This is going to get messy for yuzu, and for the future of emulation.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 demo is sticking around for another month - you need to try this</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is absolutely going to be a big success when it hits Early Access later this year, and you can try out the demo for a good while longer now so the developer can ensure they get it right.</p>
<p>It's a <em>pure</em> factory-building game. No aliens, no combat, just you and your conveyor belts spreading across a huge map. The first game in the series had a great idea with you cutting up shapes to make different shapes, and this simply builds upon the basics of it in a much more visually rich setting, along with plenty of new game mechanics.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below if you haven't seen it before:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently no changes are planned for the demo, as the developer continues working on the full game. They are working through feedback to improve various areas of the game like the reusability of shapes and production lines. Thankfully the dev said there was "very little negative feedback" so overall they're onto something good.</p>
<p>As of late last week, the demo had been played by over 109,477 unique people - impressive.</p>
<p>The Native Linux demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> until March 25th.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 is going to be massive and I&#39;m hyped</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Matt Dabrowski recently did a fresh developer video on the upcoming Streets of Rogue 2, and it's really going to be massive.</p>
<p>What is it: Streets of Rogue 2 is a crazy, immersive RPG sandbox set in a vast randomly generated open world where freedom and fun are dialed up to 11. Fight, sneak, hack, farm, build, steal, or talk your way to power as you try to topple a corrupt president in countless possible ways – solo or with friends.</p>
<p>The sequel is going to be a much bigger game, with the developer mentioning in the latest developer video below that even the default map size is "meant to be like a scaled down version of a very small country, which still ends up kind of enormous". Dabrowski then talks a bit about how that's actually done using various algorithms for random generation, a fun look behind the curtain. It all sounds pretty complicated but Dabrowski does a really fun job of breaking it down into the basics to show how the world map is actually built, and shows a little on how you'll be building your own stuff.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nGahQVeBoTY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ecb88b3e077bd2a72745641de687d287.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nGahQVeBoTY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The first is one of my favourites to play with others so I really can't wait to play Streets of Rogue 2. It's due out sometime later this year. Will you be picking it up?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>PC and handheld gaming with Linux levels up with Bazzite v2.3.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite version 2.3.0 has been released, and it should make installing it a whole lot easier across different devices from PCs to handhelds. The developers think it's the "next generation of Linux Gaming".</p>
<p>Reminder on what it is: Bazzite is a custom image of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/" target="_blank">Fedora Atomic Linux</a> utilizing Universal Blue's image framework designed to bring users the best in Linux gaming for their PCs, including the Steam Deck and other handhelds. So think of it like a <em>much</em> fancier more customizable version of SteamOS.</p>
<p>With the new release of Bazzite version 2.3.0 it includes offline ISOs, which should be faster and fix issues people had where it wouldn't boot and they've also managed to get <a href="https://ventoy.net" target="_blank">Ventoy</a> support in too (which is a great tool for booting almost any ISO). More installer improvements are planned too, this is just the start.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9600528121709038514gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9600528121709038514gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Big Picture Mode.</em></p>
<p>Some of the other improvements in Bazzite 2.3.0 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A warning when the currently booted image is over a month old.</li>
<li>Automatic nested desktop resolution handling for a number of handhelds.</li>
<li>Improvement to support for GPD Win Mini, GPD Max 2, GPD Win 4.</li>
<li>Added joystickwake to keep screen alive from controller input.</li>
<li>Added support for the AYANEO Air Plus.</li>
<li>Defaults to X11 on NVIDIA now.</li>
<li>Support for REALTEK RTL8814AU and RTLXXAU devices.</li>
<li>BoxBuddy included pre-installed for a Distrobox UI.</li>
<li>Improvements to the upgrade system.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes everywhere.</li>
<li>+ plenty more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers said they also plan to support the MSI Claw and Orange Pi Neo, with Steam Deck OLED support currently stuck due to issues with newer Linux kernels (but the original Steam Deck LCD is supported).</p>
<p>You can see all the 2.3.0 changes on <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v2.3.0" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and check out their <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-buzz-12/688" target="_blank">overview post</a>.

      <title>Free and open source evolution sim Thrive gets big new gameplay features in v0.6.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is a free and open source evolution sim from Revolutionary Games Studio that's currently in-development, and a new release has rolled out with v0.6.5 bringing some gameplay additions.</p>
<p>What many people like to compare to the cell stage in the classic Spore, not many games have attempted anything really like this so it's great to see it continue to expand.</p>
<p>One of the major new features in this release is a part unlock system, so some of the organelles are locked behind specific conditions giving you more to actually do to progress in the game. There's also a fog of war on the patch map, which is where you see different biomes / areas in the early parts of the game. Some big performance improvements have come along too including more multi-threading and they say they've reduced overall memory allocations by about 75% during gameplay. You'll also find more tutorials and an expanded Thriveopedia for in-game info.</p>
<p>See their new overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hg6jv75cbgU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee8ec4eb6bc5e183f64c9be7f1380e87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hg6jv75cbgU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See their <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-40-unlocking-potential/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more on the update.</p>
<p>The developers also mentioned they're about to update from <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> 3 to 4, so that should hopefully come with various improvements too.</p>
<p>You can grab it free from <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive-Launcher" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or buy it to support the developer on <a href="https://revolutionarygames.itch.io/thrive" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley v1.6 confirmed to release in March, hits over 30 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next big free upgrade for Stardew Valley now has a release date in March and there's plenty to look forward to. Stardew Valley also just celebrated its 8th anniversary.</p>
<p>Confirmation of a March 19th release date comes from creator ConcernedApe (Eric Barone), who <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762192764899627457" target="_blank">posted</a> on X:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="It's the 8th anniversary of Stardew Valley. Thank you for all the support over the years! Today I am announcing the PC Release date for the 1.6 update: --March 19th--. Console &amp; Mobile will follow as soon as possible." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3051831401709033225gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Not only that but in a follow up <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147" target="_blank">post</a> Barone mentioned that Stardew Valley has also now sold over 30 million copies, which is simply incredible. Last time I remember seeing a sales count it was 20 million <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/stardew-valley-hits-20-million-sales/" target="_blank">back in May 2022</a>. The official <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank">press page</a> has also been updated to note the 30 million milestone as of February 2024, with over 19 million of those being on PC.</p>
<p>What to expect from the 1.6 update? Barone previously <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1707155027914035542" target="_blank">teased</a> in a post on X that it will have a major new festival, two new mini festivals, new late-game content to expand each of the skill areas, new items and crafting recipes, 100+ new lines of dialogue, winter outfits for villagers, 8 player support for multiplayer, a new farm type, new secrets and more.</p>
<p>Will you be jumping back in for the 1.6 update? </p>
<p>Stardew Valley has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with Proton 9 - adds fixes for Helldivers 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-9-now-in-beta-with-improved-game-compatibility-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">testing is open for Proton 9</a>, Valve have now updated Proton Experimental to move over to Proton 9 along with a bunch of extra game fixes for Steam Deck / Linux. Confused about the different versions and want to learn more about Proton? Check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>On top of all the changes from Proton 9, these are what were newly added with the Proton Experimental update for February 26th. First up, noted as now playable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hero's Land</li>
<li>Onimusha: Warlords</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The other fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Made Helldivers 2 work more reliably on different setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Halo Infinite somtimes crashing during "initalizing data".</li>
<li>Fixed Russian language rendering in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons launcher.</li>
<li>Fixed green stripe in Greedfall video playback.</li>
<li>Fixed launch failure with STORY OF SEASONS: A Wonderful Life configuration tool.</li>
<li>Updated Wine-Mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-9.0.0" target="_blank">9.0.0</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16809937701708962820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16809937701708962820gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/793059711708962857gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/793059711708962857gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Helldivers 2 on Linux</p>
<p>And the Wine Mono 9.0.0 changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>macOS-related updates:
<ul>
<li>Fixed Mono using direct GS access to read the win32 "last error" value, which does not work in 64-bit Wine on macOS.</li>
<li>Mono now ignores the TMPDIR environment variable, which is not normally set on Windows, but in Wine on macOS it's inherited from the host environment. This had caused errors creating temporary files.</li>
<li>The test suite now has macOS-specific and Linux-specific expected results, and I have verified that the tests pass on macOS with this release. (Full CI for macOS coming soon, I hope.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many System.Configuration improvements, with much of Mono's code replaced with code from referencesource.</li>
<li>Assemblies installed in the GAC can now use SkipVerification. Mono didn't allow this for reasons that were unclear, and it's hard to test whether .NET Framework matches. This had caused "invalid IL code" errors in 8.0.0 with assemblies installed to the Windows GAC, because that was the first version to inform Mono that those assemblies were in the GAC. Those regressions should be fixed now.</li>
<li>Added Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.dll.</li>
<li>Fixed the PDB filenames embedded in PE dll's.</li>
<li>FNA now uses D3D11 by default instead of OpenGL. This should fix hangs in some games that use multiple threads with XNA.</li>
<li>Changed the <code class="inline-code">List<t>.Sort(Comparison<t>)</t></t></code> method to not count as a modification. This is a bug in .NET Framework that Shenzhen I/O depends on.</li>
<li>Updated the registry information with a new .NET Framework Release number, which helps the XSplit Broadcaster Installer (but XSplit still doesn't work).</li>
<li>GC invocations and traced methods are now logged to <code class="inline-code">WINE_FTRACE_FILE</code> if it is set in the environment.</li>
<li>The DriveInfo.VolumeLabel property has been imported from referencesource.</li>
<li>Upstream updates:
<ul>
<li>Mono to main branch as of 2024-01-26</li>
<li>FNA to 24.01</li>
<li>FNA.NetStub to master branch as of 2023-10-27</li>
<li>llvm-mingw to 20231128</li>
<li>SDL to 2.28.5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Windowkill is a clever multi-window twin-stick shooter that moves around your screen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might be one of the most unique games I've ever played. Windowkill from torcado just released on Steam with Native Linux support and its use of multiple moving windows really changes the bullet-hell genre. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p><em>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's not just a great game but another fun example of what Godot devs can do.</em></p>
<p>An experimental game where the play area is constantly shrinking around you, and you need to move all over your screen in this little window to get at enemies, or away from them. You shoot the window borders to expand it, making it quite chaotic and challenging to do that on top of firing at enemies to not get swarmed. Other windows will spawn on your desktop, with bosses and all sorts. It's just so exceptionally clever and surprisingly works really well too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15918868961708957805gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15918868961708957805gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Windowkill on Kubuntu - KDE Plasma (X11)</em></p>
<p><em>I did also test it on Wayland too with KDE Plasma, and it works fine there too.</em></p>
<p>Part of what makes it challenging, is that your bullets stop at the window edge which is how you expand the window. So to take down bosses like one pictured above, you <em>need</em> to get the windows to overlap. It's a game of <em>constant</em> movement, you're always thinking of where you want to go next and how to get there while avoiding enemies darting at you, bosses firing at you, other enemies sneaking in behind you and more. Pure chaotic fun.</p>
<p>Mechanically it's a twin-stick bullet-hell, that throws in a sprinkle of Vampire Survivor-like popularised gem drops to pick up, to then continually upgrade your little character. Here though, you can power-up <em>whenever</em> you want. The shop is always open at the tap of a button to jump in and spend some purple dots to upgrade. You can get more health, multi-shots, shots that pierce through multiple enemies, splash damage from your bullets and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vA60y3bpKBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7afdfb35287f999ccdc8f713894bbf48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vA60y3bpKBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Defeating each boss will drop down a special upgrade item too, allowing you to pick something extra. There's some fun options here too like an an extra window that will have an area on it that just constantly damages enemies, or giving you the ability (on a cool down) to enlarge the main window to temporarily make it a bit easier and give you more space and so on. So many options that makes it such a fun game to repeatedly jump back into for one more run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13593976271708959844gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13593976271708959844gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Windowkill on Kubuntu - KDE Plasma (X11)</em></p>
<p>How about on the Steam Deck? So it works quite well on Desktop Linux but I was curious how it would go there. Considering the type of game, I didn't think it would actually really work. Curiously, the Native Linux version would show a Godot logo screen and then my device just reboots. Proton 8 at least got it to launch but the multi-window system didn't work well in Gaming Mode and I couldn't actually do anything. Looking on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2726450#8CHrZ1K2cS" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> someone else mentioned the reboot issue too. For now, seems you'll need Desktop Mode on Steam Deck to make it work. So I'll just stick to playing this one on my desktop, where I'm massively enjoying it.</p>
<p>This game deserves many more eyes on it and much success. Wonderful idea. This is probably going to take over my free time for a while (when I'm not constantly dying in Helldivers 2). A nice coffee-break game that will make you play a bit too long and have your coffee go cold.</p>

      <title>Stealthy platformer Kiyo in need of Linux testers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Pixel Rats emailed in about their stealthy platformer that now has a Playtest available on Steam, and they're requesting backup from Linux players to see how it runs across different systems.</p>
<p>More about it: "Sneak, fight and sabotage an evil bunny corporation in this stealthy platformer. Join a resistance group of animals trying to get their home planet back from the paws of evil rabbits. Master stealth, swing with ninja ropes, crack tricky puzzles and enjoy satirical humour!"</p>
<p>The developer mentioned they wrote their game engine from scratch, so it's vital they get as many people as possible to give it a go to ensure the eventual release works well. Check out the trailer showcase below:</p>

      <title>We can probably say a final goodbye to Roblox on Linux with Wine soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Roblox recently introduced Hyperion anti-tamper, there were some issues running it on Linux, but there's been workarounds and some of the Roblox staff made it to work on Linux with Wine again, but it seems not for much longer.</p>
<p>This ongoing saga of Roblox working, then not working, then working again and so on looks like it's about to end and not in a good way for people playing it on Linux with Wine. The info comes from the Roblox developer forum (login required), spread across a few posts in the topic "<a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/1" target="_blank">Why isn’t Hyperion an anti-cheat?</a>".</p>
<p>Roblox staff member Bitdancer once again answering lots of questions, and then <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/22?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">this</a> was noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a similar issue with our unofficial Wine support. We see it being used for cheating, which is heartbreaking, to be honest, as this was a personal effort of our developers under the assumption that folks out there would understand and not misuse it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to a user asking if "Roblox on Linux is likely not gonna last much longer?", Bitdancer <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/27?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am very sorry, but you are correct. Unfortunately, we have exhausted our options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/29?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">expanding</a> on the why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wine is an excellent tool for reverse engineering. Additionally, we had to disable many antitamper checks to make Hyperion run on Wine. This has allowed interested parties to learn a lot about the internal workings of Hyperion, relevant to both Win32 and UWP. As the initial shock of Hyperion’s release started wearing off, many people have begun discovering the various angles through which one can learn more about the inner workings of Hyperion. Apparently, many have done just that, necessitating us to become more strict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing across <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/33?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">another</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason I gave above is one, rather significant, reason but not the only one. There have been many contributing factors. For example, the increased detection of cheating on Wine, the floundering of Wine-based Roblox exploits on different Discord servers, and the question of maintainability. Hyperion is a complex piece of software; we introduced more than one bug in Hyperion because we wanted to make something work on Wine. Ultimately, every responsible company must ask whether it is worth the effort. Who is responsible when things go wrong? What does unofficial support really mean? How many users of other platforms will be inconvenienced by our decision to support Wine? How can we make features such as kernel components work, and so much more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they explained in the quotes above, it doesn't necessarily mean Linux players specifically are the ones actually cheating, but the way they enabled it to work has allowed cheat makers to look a bit more behind the scenes to enable cheats even on Windows.</p>
<p>So, if you are playing it on Linux, or you were wanting to, it certainly sounds like it will be entirely blocked at some point. A shame, considering how massive a platform Roblox is. It's good to see their team be so clear and open about the issues though, rather than just blocking it and not giving an answer like plenty of other games do.</p>

      <title>Upcoming GZDoom shooter Selaco will have Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco looks absolutely incredible, a first-person shooter built on GZDoom that I've covered a few times because the demos were so much fun. And at the Early Access release in May, it's going to have Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Building up some more excitement for what I fully expect to be quite a big hit in the shooter space, the official Selaco X account posted about the upcoming modding support via Steam Workshop. Noting in a <a href="https://twitter.com/SelacoGame/status/1761426428170494456" target="_blank">thread</a> that Selaco will have support for new maps, weapons, enemies, gameplay changes and more — a lot of it thanks to GZDoom already having such an active modding scene so it's modding support in general is great. Can't wait to see what people create for it!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nUbF8Ytadx0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9d495c1130ff6c161a0637adada5e7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nUbF8Ytadx0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A lengthy story-driven campaign - Selaco is a story-driven experience, and we don't say that lightly. A dedicated writer has been brought on board to assist with creating an engaging and believable sci-fi story and world.</li>
<li>Intense Action set pieces - Turn the entire world into confetti with the destructive power of your weapons. Every single bullet will react properly with any materials or objects you hit. Our artists have created many different variations for each (voxel)object to ensure that the aftermath of each encounter is palpable. That once lavish office space now nothing but a pile of rubble with broken paintings, smashed tables, screen, chairs, smoke, and chunks of debris.</li>
<li>Custom AI - With our FEAR influence, writing proper AI was a goal from the get go. The enemy is fully aware of each other's presence and work together to take you down. They will keep their distance if you apply constant pressure on them, will rush you if you hide or run out of bullets, toss grenades if you use the same cover for too long, and much more. Hundreds of custom lines have been written and acted out, providing hints to the player about their current plans and tactics.</li>
<li>Full soundtrack - Selaco is accompanied by a full length original soundtrack composed by an experienced musician who has worked on many games in the past.</li>
<li>Professional voice-acting - To help immerse players in the story and atmosphere of Selaco, professional voice actors have been brought on board. Dawn will be voiced by the incredibly talented Melissa Medina, with other casting choices revealed at a later date.</li>
<li>Extra Gamemodes - Completing levels allows you to replay that level in Incursion Mode, an expanded version of that map where your skills will be tested against a near endless onslaught of enemies. Win incursion maps to gain bonuses to aid you throughout the campaign. New exclusive Incursion Levels and new mutators will also be unlocked as the campaign progresses.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow Selaco along on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. It will have full Native Linux support at the Early Access release on May 31st.</p>

      <title>Proton 9.0 now in Beta with improved game compatibility for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced that Proton 9.0 is now available for testing, with lots of game compatibility improvements for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux thanks to it now being based on the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/wine-9-0-brings-much-improved-windows-app-and-game-compatibility-to-linux/" target="_blank">Wine 9.0 release</a>.</p>
<p>How to get it? Simply search for Proton 9.0 in your Steam Library (not the Steam Store!), and select to install it. Exactly the same on Steam Deck or Desktop Linux. You can also try <a href="steam://install/2805730" target="_blank">this link</a> to directly install it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13716504621708774686gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13716504621708774686gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then you can selectively set games to Proton 9.0 in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility options for each game.</p>
<p>Valve said that the public beta will be "updated more regularly with regression fixes prior to the Proton 9.0-1 release".

      <title>Discord Overlay for Linux v0.7.0 should improve idling and on battery power </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Discover, not to be confused with the KDE Discover software store, is a Discord overlay for Linux and the first update in a while is out now with version 0.7.0.</p>
<p>What does it actually do? It allows you to easily have a configurable on-screen Discord overlay to show who is currently talking, or to display text and images from selected channels.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/trigg/Discover/releases/tag/v0.7.0" target="_blank">release notes</a> for 0.7.0 the developers mentioned: "This update brings in a bunch of changes which remove our previous reliance on timeouts. For most users this will seem to do absolutely nothing, but for users where this program is idling and on battery power it will allow the OS to scale down battery usage much further than previously able."</p>
<p>Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix rendering title with incorrect font.</li>
<li>Fix accidentally using None in dud voice data.</li>
<li>Included a lot of RPC documentation to README.</li>
<li>Differentiate Text &amp; Notification window titles for better catching by window managers.</li>
<li>Catch monitors layout change and monitor resolution change and re-render overlays.</li>
<li>Reduce reconnect rate when local discord goes away.</li>
<li>Cache user access token and attempt to reconnect quicker using it.</li>
<li>Changed connection origin to localhost.</li>
<li>Rewrote entire connection handler core to remove timeouts that never stopped.
<ul>
<li>Removed 60hz tick for reading local connection to discord.</li>
<li>Removed 1hz tick for re-rendering voice overlay even if data remained the same.</li>
<li>Removed 1hz tick for re-rendering notification overlay even if data remained the same.</li>
<li>Add a one-off timeout after render where data is expected to auto-hide itself.</li>
<li>Implemented socket read and reconnect login in GLib main loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a community made project, not affiliated with Discord, made due to "the shortcomings in support on Linux by the official discord client".</p>

<p>As we saw from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-users-redeemed-over-80-million-in-physical-wallet-cards-in-december-2023/" target="_blank">Steam 2023 Overview</a>, a lot of games are managing to find success. It has slipped down the Steam charts a bit now though thanks to the recent releases of Helldivers 2, Last Epoch, Pacific Drive and others. And it was only natural it would calm down after the initial rush and hype period but no doubt it will rank back up again on the first major content update.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 550.54.14 driver released as stable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today launched the 550.54.14 Linux driver as stable coming with a whole bunch of fixes and improvements, so here's all that's changed.</p>
<p>Seems NVIDIA took on what I said to them about their recent changelogs being confusing for end-users (noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-550-40-07-beta-driver-released-with-fixes-for-vrr-and-wayland/" target="_blank">the previous NVIDIA Beta article</a>), so now they're including a note on changes between this version and the last in the same series. </p>
<p>So the changes from the previous 550.40.07 Beta to this stable version are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused HDMI FRL displays to flicker or blank when enabling VRR with 8 bits per color channel.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced with the 550.40.07 beta driver which caused corrupted window decorations in some applications when running on GNOME.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where vkAcquireNextImageKHR() was not returning VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR when it should with WSI X11 swapchains.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where fences passed to VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT could signal earlier than expected when a WSI X11 swap chain becomes out of date.</li>
<li>Fixed Xid errors on Hogwarts Legacy and Forza Horizon 4.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_encode_queue, VK_KHR_video_encode_h264, VK_KHR_video_encode_h265 and VK_KHR_video_maintenance1 extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression which prevented some Vulkan applications from receiving VK_DEVICE_LOST upon a VT switch, which could lead to the application hanging or behaving incorrectly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from honoring the --gbm-backend-dir command line option.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the changes on top of that when going from the 545.29.06 driver to this version are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Wayland applications to run at less than one frame per second on Maxwell, Volta, and Pascal series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an intermittent drop in desktop framerate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused “Flip event timeout” messages to be printed to the system log when displays are hotplugged when nvidia-drm is loaded with the <code class="inline-code">fbdev=1</code> kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent Xid errors on Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus, Forza Horizon 5, and Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the “NoMaxPClkCheck” mode validation token from working on single-link TMDS (e.g. DVI, HDMI) outputs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed VRR displays to be driven below their minimum refresh rate, resulting in a blank or flickering image.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve Kwin performance on hybrid GPU systems by setting <code class="inline-code">OGL_DEDICATED_HW_STATE_PER_CONTEXT=ENABLE_ROBUST</code>.</li>
<li>Updated the build process for NVIDIA kernel modules to honor the <code class="inline-code">INSTALL_MOD_DIR</code> Kbuild environment variable.</li>
<li>Added support for R8, GR88 and YCbCr GBM formats.</li>
<li>Optimized the X driver headless framerate limiter to more closely mimic upstream behavior and prevent it from activating in inconvenient situations. Added a new X config option <code class="inline-code">LimitFrameRateWhenHeadless</code> to disable the headless framerate limiter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Gamescope from running when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the installer package from being unpacked on systems where zstd is not installed, when /tmp is mounted noexec.</li>
<li>Use transparent huge pages when available for the .text section. This is done through <code class="inline-code">madvise()</code> calls, and requires <code class="inline-code">CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS</code>.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from “nvidia-frontend” to “nvidia” and “nvidiactl”. Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0 and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an application is run with <code class="inline-code">__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via Wine.</li>
<li>Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a mix of physical and virtual displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend, which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when running on Wayland with newer versions of libwayland-client.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's <em>more</em> listed on the official changelog, but a bunch of those were available in older NVIDIA driver releases, as NVIDIA list all changes since the previous Production release.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA open source driver to use NVK + Zink for OpenGL on newer GPUs</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628" target="_blank">recent merge</a> request on the Mesa Git repository added the initial support for allowing drivers to chose Zink as the translation layer for handling OpenGL. This basically does an OpenGL-on-Vulkan implementation making it easier for newer cards to support OpenGL through a generic implementation, reducing duplicate code and making it easier to keep OpenGL around since while not yet deprecated it is being less used on modern games.</p>
<p>The merge allows owners of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20xx series GPUs and newer to opt to use Zink instead of relying on the default NVC0 Gallium3D implementation to handle OpenGL requests. Those who want to give it a try, it should be as simple as setting the <code class="inline-code">NOUVEAU_USE_ZINK=1</code> environment variable after updating Mesa 24.1 when your distribution receives the update that is currently only on the main branch of Mesa repository.</p>
<p>Since the merge from branch <code class="inline-code">airlied/zink-driver-choice</code> to <code class="inline-code">main</code> was merged <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628#note_null" target="_blank">2 days ago</a>, most distros might not be distributing those patches yet. For those who use source-based distros or any source-base package building system like AUR, the package <code class="inline-code">mesa-git</code> is <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mesa-git" target="_blank">available</a> as a means of tracking the main branch and testing these bleeding-edge features.</p>
<p>While NVK as a technology is still in-development with plenty left to do, there has been lots of improvements being implemented on the last year. Related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/mesa-240-out-now-with-amd-radv-ray-tracing-improvements-more-nvidia-nvk-improvements/" target="_blank">Mesa 24.0 out now with AMD RADV ray-tracing improvements, more NVIDIA NVK improvements</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, developer Mike Blumenkrantz recently put up another <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/woof/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about NVK work and thanks to some recent changes mentioned that "As a result, all GL games now work on NVK. No hyperbole. They just work".</p>

      <title>Snap store from Canonical (Ubuntu) hit with another crypto scam app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/snap-store-from-canonical-hit-with-malicious-apps/" target="_blank">Not the first time</a> this has happened, but recently the Snap store from Canonical hosted a scam bitcoin app that claimed to be "Exodus wallet" that caused a user to lose money.</p>
<p>Posting on the Snapcraft <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904" target="_blank">forum</a> an unfortunate user noted their wallet has been emptied after using it, and a day later a Canonical staffer <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904/5" target="_blank">mentioned</a> it had now been removed and they were investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical, has now jumped into the discussion in another <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/should-unverified-cryptocurrency-apps-be-banned/38919/4" target="_blank">forum post</a> to note that while "cryptocurrency is largely a cesspit of ignoble intentions even if the mathematics are interesting", Shuttleworth doesn't think that "banning cryptocurrency apps helps" as "If anything, it would make using Linux much worse.".</p>
<p>Additionally, Shuttleworth also opened an additional <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/stronger-identity-verification-for-all-publishers/39061" target="_blank">forum post</a> to discuss requiring "more comprehensive proof of publisher identity for every publisher" for Snaps. So if you have good ideas for them to implement, to make Snap publishing more secure - drop a reply in the linked post.</p>
<p>Hopefully Canonical come up with a good solution, because repeating issues like this reflect pretty poorly on Snap, Canonical and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Alan Pope (formerly of Canonical, now Axiom) wrote up two blog posts on it "<a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/" target="_blank">Exodus Bitcoin Wallet: $490K Swindle</a>" and the follow-up "<a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-follow-up/" target="_blank">Exodus Bitcoin Wallet: Follow up 2.0</a>" that you may want to read for a little more background.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform development library SDL3 gets a Vulkan Renderer and camera API</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With development work ongoing for SDL3, some recent exciting improvements include a Vulkan Render backend and a camera API.</p>
<p>What is SDL? Simple DirectMedia Layer is an open source cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, graphics hardware and more. It's popular and used by quite a lot of games, even Valve use it. See more on the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>
<p>SDL3 is going to be a pretty <em>big</em> release and just recently Valve developer Dan Ginsburg had their Vulkan Renderer merged into the project. From the <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9114" target="_blank">pull request</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This pull request adds an implementation of a Vulkan Render backend to SDL. I have so far tested this primarily on Windows, but also smoke tested on Linux and macOS (MoltenVK). I have not tried it yet on Android, but it should be usable there as well (sans any bugs I missed). This began as a port of the SDL Direct3D12 Renderer, which is the closest thing to Vulkan as existed in the SDL codebase. The shaders are more or less identical (with the only differences being in descriptor bindings vs root descriptors). The shaders are built using the HLSL frontend of glslang.</p>
<p>Everything in the code is pure Vulkan 1.0 (no extensions), with the exception of HDR support which requires the Vulkan instance extension VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace. The code could have been simplified considerably if I used dynamic rendering, push descriptors, extended dynamic state, and other modern Vulkan-isms, but I felt it was more important to make the code as vanilla Vulkan as possible so that it would run on any Vulkan implementation.</p>

      <title>CrossOver 24 released with Wine 9.0 - plus CodeWeavers still hiring developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CodeWeavers have announced the release of CrossOver 24, their application for managing games and applications designed for Windows installed with Wine on Linux and macOS. CodeWeavers support development on Wine and they also work with Valve on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>!</p>
<p>CrossOver 24 includes these big improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" target="_blank">Wine 9.0</a>, <em>bringing with it over 7,000 changes that offer improvements to a variety of applications</em></li>
<li>Wine Mono 8.1.0</li>
<li>vkd3d 1.10</li>
<li>MoltenVK 1.2.5</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus they've also upgraded the CrossOver UI to include some much requested additions like the ability to drag and drop files onto the app to install and run them, which includes a new ability to create a launcher for it at the same time too. On top of that there's also the inclusion of a feature to change the directory of where your bottles are stored.</p>
<p>Additionally for Linux they also noted the new Office 365 installers now work and they fixed crashes with PowerPoint 2016/365 but they noted "only the 32-bit online Office installers work". See more in the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2024/2/22/crossover-24-with-wine-9-in-record-time" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>They're also still hiring developers with multiple positions open. This includes a General Wine Developer, Web Developer and an Administrative Operations Associate that you can see on their <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/about/jobs" target="_blank">jobs page</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com" target="_blank">CodeWeavers website</a>. They're also offering a discount of 24% off the price of CrossOver+ and renewals until March 2, 2024 with the code <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/store?deal=WineNine" target="_blank">WineNine</a>.</p>

      <title>Lies of P recently removed Denuvo and it&#39;s on sale - good time for soulslike fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who skip over games that have Denuvo, you might want to go and check in with the rather good soulslike game Lies of P as it's been removed from the game.</p>
<p>The developers didn't actually announce it, and even the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/4195735657914862794" target="_blank">patch notes</a> don't mention the removal of Denuvo. It seems odd, but often when we see Denuvo removed, developers seem to try and keep it quiet. I always find that weird. But you can see clearly via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1627720/history/?changeid=U:45465881" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that it's gone and so is any mention of it on the Steam store page.</p>
<p>It is rated Steam Deck Playable (due to some small text) and Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1627720?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, and overall thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> it really does work quite nicely and is one of the best games released in 2023. Well, best if you like this sort of game, with some pretty brutal combat difficulty especially during the boss fights. </p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a puppet created by Geppetto who’s caught in a web of lies with unimaginable monsters and untrustworthy figures standing between you and the events that have befallen the world of Lies of P.</p>
<p>You are awakened by a mysterious voice that guides you through the plagued city of Krat - a once lively place that has been poisoned by madness and bloodlust. In our soulslike, you must adapt yourself and your weapons to face untold horrors, untangle the unfathomable secrets of the city's elites and choose whether to confront predicaments with the truth or weave lies to overcome them on the journey to find yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Lies of P on:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/lies-of-p?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> (on sale 25% off)</p>

      <title>The Force Engine for classic Star Wars: Dark Forces now on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want an easy way to get The Force Engine on Linux to play Star Wars: Dark Forces (and eventually Outlaws too)? Well, now it's available on Flathub. No more needing to manually compile it from source like we're back in the dark ages, making it much easier to do on Steam Deck too!</p>
<p>Current features of The Force Engine:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Dark Forces support, including mods. Outlaws support is coming in version 2.0.</li>
<li>Mod Loader - simply place your mods in the Mods/ directory as zip files or directories.</li>
<li>High Resolution and Widescreen support - when using 320x200 you get the original software renderer. TFE also includes a floating-point software renderer which supports widescreen, including ultrawide, and much higher resolutions.</li>
<li>GPU Renderer with perspective correct pitch - play at much higher resolutions with improved performance.</li>
<li>Extended Limits - TFE, by default, will support much higher limits than the original game which removes most of the HOM (Hall of Mirrors) issues in advanced mods.</li>
<li>Full input binding, mouse sensitivity adjustment, and controller support. Note, however, that menus currently require the mouse.</li>
<li>Optional Quality of Life improvements, such as full mouselook, aiming reticle, improved Boba Fett AI, autorun, and more.</li>
<li>A new save system that works seamlessly with the existing checkpoint and lives system. You can ignore it entirely, use it just as an exit save so you don’t have to play long user levels in one sitting, or full save and load with quicksaves like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.</li>
<li>OPL3 emulation and Sound Font 2 midi synthesis support.</li>
<li>Optional and quality of life features, even mouselook, can be disabled if you want the original experience. Play in 320x200, turn the mouse mode (Input menu) to Menus only or horizontal, and enable the Classic (software) renderer - and it will look and play just like DOS, but with a higher framerate and without needing to adjust cycles in DosBox.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also the Nightdive Studios remaster on the way which releases February 28th, that the developer of The Force Engine <a href="https://the-force-engine.freeforums.net/thread/253/nightdive-dark-forces-remaster" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they were helping on in a "technical advisory role". But that hasn't stopped future plans to keep on improving The Force Engine.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.theforceengine.tfe" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. You do need to own the original which you can buy easily <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_dark_forces?as=1636858786" target="_blank">on GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32400/STAR_WARS__Dark_Forces/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Geometry Survivor is wonderful nostalgia bait updated for the survivor-like era</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have some ridiculously fond memories of playing Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, to the point of having a mini-party with lots of us sat around an Xbox 360 blasting through high-scores. To see Geometry Survivor appear is quite a highlight. <em>Note: key provided by Evolve.</em></p>
<p>Taking the visual style of the classic, but putting a spin on it with mechanics that have now been made popular by Vampire Survivors, Geometry Survivor brings the best of both worlds together. Giving you some glorious neon explosions and chaos the classics are known for, but giving you the extra itch of needing another run to unlock some permanent upgrades. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20778267091708610415gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20778267091708610415gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here, unlike its inspiration, your weapons fire automatically. So all you need to worry about, like most survivor-likes, is your movement with fast reactions often being needed when you're getting completely swarmed. Well, not just movement, you also need to carefully craft your run through all the in-run upgrades you can pick. As you destroy enemies, and collect little experience orbs, you then get to pick weapons and upgrade them each level.</p>
<p>It's definitely challenging too, much more so than some other survivor games I've played which I appreciated with it. I've found numerous of them too easy, but this feels just about right. </p>
<p>I only wish there was a lot more of it! Overall it's a little on the basic side of things but that's not really a complaint, more an observation. It's good, and you can have a lot of fun with it if you enjoy arcade smashers. With the different ship types to buy that each come with a unique power like health regeneration or 30% increased game speed, on top of all the permanent upgrades to unlock and each run being a count down from 20 minutes you'll get quite a few happy hours out of it.</p>
<p>Some compatibility notes: on Steam Deck, it works just fine out of the box with Proton 8. On Desktop Linux though, you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/ge-proton-8-31-and-8-32-bring-fixes-for-helldivers-2-dark-and-darker-agarest/" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, otherwise the main menu background is <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5998778131708608751gol1.jpg" target="_blank">broken</a> as it's a video file Proton doesn't support directly. But Valve recode various videos for Steam Deck. Additionally, sometimes it would fail to launch, but clicking again and all is fine — odd. Performance not an issue at all, top quality on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux as expected.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogtemkrXtqw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f45a26f1c385c71a576746b8b2459ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogtemkrXtqw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One hand gameplay: Use just one hand to control the direction of your ship.</li>
<li>Auto-Shooter: Your weapons fire automatically, letting you concentrate on staying alive.</li>
<li>Weapons: Each run allows you to get a unique combination of weapons.</li>
<li>Credits: Earn credits and permanently unlock new upgrades.</li>
<li>Enemies: Enjoy the multitude of enemies each with their own AI.</li>
<li>20 minutes of intense gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro visuals and music straight from the 80s.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic price for what it is too at only £4.29 when not on sale. Gets a full thumbs up from me if you love retro-looking arcade action with plenty of chaos.</p>

      <title>Move over Diablo 4 and Path of Exile as Last Epoch 1.0 is here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next action RPG? Diablo and Path of Exile fans may want to take a look at Last Epoch, which has finally left Early Access with the 1.0 update and there's plenty to love about it. <em>Truthfully, I can't even remember how I got my copy it's been so many years. </em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/last-epoch-1-0-patch-notes/62536" target="_blank">1.0 patch notes</a> are pretty long but the gist of it is full controller support, an offline mode, new cinematics, various graphical improvements, the Item Factions system, new skills and absolutely loads more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ddvY964TCoQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6aa044d4234a0a7f5d8e77b94686ea5e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ddvY964TCoQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“I want to sincerely thank all of our fans from the bottom of our hearts,” said Judd Cobler, Founder and CEO of Eleventh Hour Games, and Game Director for Last Epoch. “We are a team formed from the ARPG community, and to be able to make it this far with Last Epoch and share this creation with you is a dream come true. We cannot wait for you to experience the full release and the awesome plans we have for the future.”</p>
<p>Last Epoch has Native Linux support and it does work on Steam Deck, although Valve note it as Unsupported on Steam Deck that rating was from May 2022 so they need to update it. There are some issues in the default OpenGL version though like the map being blank, which you can get around simply with "-force-vulkan" as a launch option in Steam. Go into the Properties and put that in the Launch Options text box.</p>
<p>I also had no sound by default on Kubuntu which was solved using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/no-sound-in-war-thunder-on-linux-heres-a-potential-solution/" target="_blank">same method as War Thunder</a> using this Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">FMOD_ALSA_DEVICE=pulse %command% -force-vulkan </code></p>
<p>Check out the 1.0 patch video if you're a previous player:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LGNB-ZuNREo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21b6417abbcaf2dee941566dafc0e4e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LGNB-ZuNREo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So far it's proven to be popular with it hitting a peak player count on Steam of over 150,000 players which has clearly beaten Diablo 4 and it's closing in on Path of Exile's all-time Steam record quickly. It currently has a Very Positive overall user rating on Steam too, although the recent reviews are only Mostly Positive which seems to be due to server issues so it will probably bounce-back once they're fully sorted.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s no end to Vampire Survivor-likes with Temtem: Swarm announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days when every developer seemed to be announcing some kind of Battle Royale game or mode for an existing game? Well now it's very much Vampire Survivor-likes. Even the monster catching Temtem is being turned into one with Temtem: Swarm.</p>
<p>I continue to be a sucker for all of them too, and Temtem: Swarm looks quite delightful actually. Seems like a fun blending of monster catchers and survivor-likes with evolving creatures, lots of abilities and upgrades, overpowered strategies, chaos and big boss battles. You can even play it online in co-op with others.</p>
<p>Check out the new announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HuUVIBDONEA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ff46e1d5a3909f3c90d44cfd7b1aecb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HuUVIBDONEA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No doubt it will work just fine with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, and I will absolutely be diving into this one to see what it's like. Will you be checking it out as well?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510960/Temtem_Swarm/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It's due out in Q3 2024.</p>

      <title>Steam users redeemed over $80 million in physical wallet cards in December 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues to pretty much print money, and they've released their latest yearly review and 2023 seems to be another great year for Steam.</p>
<p>This time around, they didn't give all that many details on Steam's overall growth. We didn't get notes on monthly or daily active users like we've seen in the past. And most of the post is simply going over features they added for users and developers during 2023. Still, they did give a <em>few</em> details on that and what they showed was still really surprising.</p>
<p>One of those surprising marks is physical wallet cards, which Valve said during December 20th to December 31st, 2023 that "players redeemed more than $80 million in physical wallet cards". That's a whole lot of gifting going on! Valve also said these physical cards are "some of the most expensive payment methods we support" but the benefits are clear for both developers and Steam users.</p>
<p>Valve also showed one element of their growth with a comparison of the Steam Autumn Sale between 2022 and 2023 showing many developers managing to find success. With a 21% increase in the amount of games earning over $1M in revenue.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steam Autumn Sale</strong></td>
<td><strong>Increase from 2022 to 2023</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $1K Revenue</td>
<td>+19%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $10K Revenue</td>
<td>+17%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $100K Revenue</td>
<td>+17%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $500K Revenue</td>
<td>+19%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $1M Revenue</td>
<td>+21%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another big note is that 2023 was the first year in the entire history of Steam where over 500 games earned more than $3 million in gross revenue in one year, Valve said this was more than double the number of games hitting it versus 2018.</p>
<p>It's not just existing and well-known developers doing well though. As Valve notes with their Top 20 game releases each month by revenue that in 2023 more than a quarter of them were from studios releasing on Steam for the very first time.</p>
<p>2023 was also the year that Steam crossed over 33 million concurrent users for the first time!</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment the retro Diablo styled Vampire Survivors-like &#39;closing in on the finale&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer studio Chasing Carrots say they're "closing in on the finale" for the fantastic Halls of Torment, which blends a classic Diablo style with Vampire Survivors-like gameplay for a great mix.</p>
<p>The latest update is out now adding in plenty of performance improvements, so it should run better than before. But there's also a bunch of new content added for people who have played for a while. This includes the Chambers of Dissonance, the next stage that can be unlocked by defeating the Twisted Construct in Frozen Depths that comes with its own quest board and music track.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also a new projectile focused character named Landsknecht that has an arquebus and magic grenades, who can be unlocked in the new Chambers of Dissonance. Another new character was added, Sage, whose main weapon is the first ability you choose at the beginning of a run.</p>

<p>There's also new abilities like the Morning Star, a physical projectile/melee ability that gets a damage buff with force and Spectral Fists ability which is a directly attacking summon ability. Lots of smaller changes too like new quest icons, the HUD shows if you have auto attack and/or auto aim enabled or not, bug fixes and so on.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. It gets a firm recommendation from me.</p>

      <title>Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters (open source Star Control 2) now available on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters, which is an open source version of the classic Star Control 2, has managed to get a Steam release from Pistol Shrimp Games. The developer team includes both of the original designers Paul Reiche and Fred Ford and they're currently working on The Ur-Quan Masters 2.</p>
<p>The Steam release sadly only comes with the Windows version, even though the <a href="https://sc2.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">main project</a> fully supports Linux and macOS too. According to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2645580/discussions/0/4203616172207532738/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post: "This release includes a few things which are not default settings in other releases, like voice over, 3DO music, and other minor changes. No source code has been modified. We also wanted to bring the game to Steam to reach the millions of players who use it as their game library of choice."</p>
<p>It will no doubt run just fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> though for those who want an easy click and play experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2QYlWNdx5FE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/441b4a4d1dc8cc87023d8ad9112a0b75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2QYlWNdx5FE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience an open-world adventure, venturing through space to defeat the invading Ur-Quan and its hierarchy of battle thralls.</li>
<li>Travel through extra-dimensional HyperSpace and discover nearly 500 unknown star systems filled with alien worlds.</li>
<li>Fight enemies in fast-paced space battles with 25 different starships, each with its own unique attacks and powers.</li>
<li>Befriend, threaten, or fight a diverse cast of aliens with unique personalities, from scary, to funny, to just plain weird.</li>
<li>Explore thousands of planets, collecting resources and technology to upgrade your flagship and grow your fleet.</li>
<li>Play standalone Super Melee to practice space combat against AI opponents or to duel against a friend.</li>
<li>Mod and tinker with freely available, open-source code and content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice bit of gaming history there that inspired designers on all sorts of games like Fallout, Mass Effect, Stellaris and the list goes on. It also gives the developers another way to advertise their new game, whenever it appears.</p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2645580/Free_Stars_The_UrQuan_Masters/" target="_blank">Steam store page</a>. It's free of course still.</p>

      <title>Check out ChipWits, an upcoming remake of one of the first programming puzzle games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released back in 1984, ChipWits is a programming puzzle game and it's getting a modern remake in Unity that will be released on Steam. According to the Steam page, it will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>"ChipWits is a robot coding game with no prior programming experience required. In this game, you use an icon-based language to guide your robot to solve open-ended puzzles and rescue the crew of a space station taken over by a rogue AI, Dr. Droog."</p>
<p>The team working on ChipWits even includes one of the original co-creators, Doug Sharp. Sadly the other co-creator Mike Johnston died back in 2018 and a portion of the proceeds from the new game will go towards the <a href="http://oif.org/" target="_blank">Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation</a> in Johnston's memory (from their <a href="https://chipwits.com/2023/02/12/who-are-we/" target="_blank">Team page</a>). You can check the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d9ACRpytwGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62b256ac67c00625a733c5ed882441e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d9ACRpytwGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Like any good programming puzzler, there's no one-size-fits-all, with there being multiple solutions. It's easy to learn, but you can go back and improve to maximise your score if you wish much like Zachtronics games.</p>

      <title>Which Way Up: Space Olympics is anti-gravity party game chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turtle Flip Studio plan to launch their physics-based anti-gravity party game Which Way Up: Space Olympics sometime in Q1 2025 but there's a demo up on Steam you can try with Linux support.</p>
<p>Which Way Up: Space Olympics is designed to be easy to pickup and play, allowing players of all ages to join in on the fun through a wide range of gravity-themed multiplayer minigames. In the demo, players can go hands-on with six Space Olympics events, which can be played with up to four players for maximum chaos. The game gives you unique freedom of movement by allowing you to run on walls and ceilings, orbit around planets, or fall across entire levels by manoeuvring through gravity fields and genuinely looks like a riot.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jjYRBbgw4NA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95684eeabab63a2ee5754e5b1e9be483.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jjYRBbgw4NA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you enjoy chaos and need more casual laughs with a new party game it's one to keep an eye on. Be sure to try out the demo too, which they've said is now staying after initially appearing during Remote Play Together Fest 2024.</p>
<p>"After receiving such fantastic and constructive feedback from those who played the demo over the last week, we've decided to make our demo permanently available!" lead developer Nick Cellini said, "That way, anyone can grab their friends, jump in, have fun and contribute their ideas to the final release of the game."</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318660/Which_Way_Up_Space_Olympics/" target="_blank">it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve open sourced Steam Audio including the SDK and Plugins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Audio is a full-featured audio solution for game developers, and now anyone can pretty much do anything with it as Valve has made it entirely open source. Valve continues to show to others how it's done, with lots of their developers and contracts with others (like CodeWeavers for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>) working on various open source projects.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/596420/announcements/detail/7745698166044243233" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, Valve said "With this release, our goal is to provide more control to developers, which will lead to better experiences for their users, and hopefully valuable contributions back to the wider community of developers using Steam Audio". It's available under the Apache 2.0 license, as Valve say it allows "developers to use Steam Audio in commercial products, and to modify or redistribute it under their own licensing terms without having to include source code". Obviously though they hope people contribute back to it.</p>
<p>Part of why they've open sourced it is because development is driven by their own internal projects, which might not line up with what external developers need so they did this to remove roadblocks for developers to pick it up and do what they want.</p>
<p>Steam Audio works on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android with integrations for Unity, Unreal Engine 4, a C API and FMOD Studio.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/" target="_blank">official site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Palworld is getting external anti-cheat but it will be mostly optional</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld continues to be an incredible success seeing a 24 hour peak player count of 527,994 but cheating is causing problems, so the developers plan to address it with new anti-cheat.</p>
<p>Writing in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/6090625297485741627" target="_blank">update on Steam</a> they said a player list will be coming at the end of this month for servers, to help people better deal with nuisances. Additionally though, they will also be adding "an external anti-cheat solution to take measures against particularly frequent fraudulent activities and cheating". However, fear not Linux / Steam Deck players, as it will be optional for community servers, single player, and co-op. Seems like it will just be for official servers.</p>
<p>So hopefully that means there will be no unexpected issues with it suddenly being unplayable like we've seen when other games have added anti-cheat in the past, and like the upcoming breaking update for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 with EA Anti-Cheat</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18957662301708350306gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18957662301708350306gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game has, as games do, dropped down from it's ridiculously high release player count which peaked overall at 2,101,867. The drop caused some other gaming news sites to run articles about the drop in players. This caused the Community Manager at Pocketpair, Bucky, to write a long <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795" target="_blank">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) calling such articles "lazy". A snippet from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This emerging "Palworld has lost X% of its player base" discourse is lazy, but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games. You don't need to feel bad about that. Palworld, like many games before it, isn't in a position to pump out massive amounts of new content on a weekly basis. New content will come, and it's going to be awesome, but these things take a little bit of time. There are so many amazing games out there to play; you don't need to feel guilty about hopping from game to game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Some wise words there.</em></p>
<p>Palworld is currently rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>. You can find it in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>"Tiger-Heli marked a revolutionary moment in 1985 as Toaplan's pioneering bomb-based vertical shooter, a true innovator of its time. Despite its unassuming appearance, its lifelike gameplay resonated with fans, earning widespread acclaim in Japan and around the globe. Its legacy lived on through Twin Cobra, released just two years later, and even today it remains a cherished gem among retro gaming enthusiasts worldwide."</p>

<p>While all three of the collections may be quite a niche thing, it's still great to see many classics given a new life like this. Bitwave Games / Toaplan clearly love what they do and it shows. What you're getting here is basically a third helping of a gaming time machine, to go back in time and see some true classics. They can be quite difficult too, but thanks to all the quality of life additions, you can play them how you want making them more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>There were a few issues at release, but like with the previous collections, their team have been quick to put out patches to address them so they're supporting them well. Another worthy set of retro games to add to your desktop, Steam Deck or perhaps you have some fancy arcade cabinet?</p>
<p>You can find the full list of their games included in all packs on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's some of them on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games-toaplan" target="_blank">GOG</a> too but only Steam has the Linux / Steam Deck support.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s a new Godot Engine addon to simplify testing on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For game developers using or looking at using <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, you may want to check out the <a href="https://github.com/LauraWebdev/Godot4-DeployToSteamOS" target="_blank">Godot 4 DeployToSteamOS addon</a> which gives you a one-click method to test your games on Steam Deck. <em>Be sure to also check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/the-latest-godot-engine-2023-showreel-shows-an-impressive-variety-of-games/" target="_blank">Godot Engine 2023 showreel</a>.</em></p>
<p>This is really cool! With the popularity of the Steam Deck, which has been in the Top 10 of the Global Weekly Top Sellers list on Steam every week so far this year, it can make repeat testing a whole lot easier to do from within Godot directly and save game devs some time.</p>
<p>Currently it only supports Godot 4 C# as it "uses external libraries for establishing SSH connections and scanning for devices on your network that aren't accessible through GDScript only." It does also need you to have the SteamOS devkit installed (<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/loadgames" target="_blank">more info</a>) as it needs you to connect with it at least once for the pairing to work. No special hardware is required, the devkit runs on any normal Steam Deck and the devkit software runs on both Linux and Windows.</p>

      <title>Inflexion Games give update on Steam Deck &amp; Linux support for Nightingale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightingale is an upcoming open world survival and crafting game from Inflexion Games, it looks quite magnificent and will no doubt be another early 2024 hit and the developers put up a blog post on Steam Deck / Linux support status.</p>
<p>Much like Palworld and Enshrouded it will be in Early Access, but given how people are clearly always in the mood for more of these open world games, I fully expect it to do well. Especially so with the rather wild looking "Victorian gaslamp fantasy" setting with the ability to portal-hop through to entirely new locations using special Realm Cards and each realm features new "dangers, discoveries, and surprises, you have the power to influence its design, including prevalence of hostiles, abundance of resources, and even the environment itself".</p>
<p>Be sure to check out their gameplay overview:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PtyK4EQxK0o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd20ccdb0daad6869528efd4827aba68.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PtyK4EQxK0o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://playnightingale.com/news/pre-launch-updates" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the developers noted on the subject on Steam Deck / Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been getting a lot of questions in regards to whether Steam Deck will be supported at launch.</p>
<p>Technically, Nightingale can launch and be played on Steam Deck with the caveats to controller support listed above*, but we’re not considering it officially supported at launch. This means we will not be providing customer support for Steam Deck issues at launch as it’s considered an unofficial platform at this time.</p>
<p>We are working on full Steam Deck support and will provide an update once that status is confirmed.</p>
<p>If you have a Steam Deck, you’re welcome to play Nightingale on it and provide feedback or bug reports (more details on how to do that coming soon), but please disclose that you’re playing on Steam Deck so it’s easier for our team to recreate it internally.</p>
<p>Other versions of Linux are also not officially supported at this time, but we’re happy for you to report your bugs with details on what version you’re experiencing issues on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Their controller support notes you may occasionally need a Keyboard or Mouse input but they will fix full controller support "as soon as possible in a near future update". With Steam Input though, hopefully that won't be too much trouble since you can bind whatever buttons you wish yourself until they sort it.</p>
<p>It's nice to see Linux normally mentioned too, we don't see that too often and the developer actually being open to reported issue with it. More like this please.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/" target="_blank">Nightingale on Steam</a>. It hits Early Access on February 20th.</p>

      <title>EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE) gets new default look and different font sizes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EmulationStation Desktop Edition 3.0 is out now and it's gone through a rebrand to simply ES-DE, plus a whole bunch of improvements come with this release.</p>
<p>What is it: ES-DE is a frontend for browsing and launching games from your multi-platform game collection. It comes preconfigured for use with RetroArch and a large selection of standalone emulators. It's also fully customizable so you can easily expand it to include emulators or applications not covered by the bundled configuration.</p>
<p>Firstly, in 3.0 there is a <em>breaking</em> change. The configuration folder was originally hidden in your home as "./emulationstation" but now it's simply named "ES-DE". So you'll need to rename it yourself. You can unhide folders in your File Manager usually using CTRL+H on keyboard or in Dolphin for KDE Plasma / Steam Deck from the hamburger menu:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17847078701708341780gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17847078701708341780gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Simply rename it without the dot to just ES-DE.</p>
<p>For those of you (like me) who prefer bigger fonts, there's more options for that now too with Medium and Large font size options now available for the Slate and Modern themes. For different controller layouts, like say Nintendo, you can also now swap the menu ABXY buttons. There's lots more, including some specific additions for Linux like support for the AppImage release of Vita3K and the Flatpak release of puNES and lots more. </p>
<p>If you love emulating games, this is a top quality app to try out on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Metro Exodus hits 10 million sales - and there&#39;s more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>4A Games announced that Metro Exodus has now crossed over 10 million sales, and the good news is they have plans for more games to come. Writing in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroVideoGame/status/1758138117704618340" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) the official Metro account noted the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/time-to-blow-the-dust-off-your-vr-headset-metro-awakening-is-coming/" target="_blank">recently announced Metro VR game</a>, and also that the next mainline Metro game will come from 4A Games "when it's ready".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Metro Exodus turns 5 years old today, and has now sold over 10 Million copies.  Metro will return in VR with Metro Awakening from @vertigogames  in 2024 - and the next mainline Metro from @4AGames …  When it’s ready  Thank you for coming on the journey so far with us." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1816195541708091255gol1.png"/></p>
<p>We definitely need more high-quality story-shooters like this, so it's really great to see them tease a proper mainline addition to the series is on the way don't you think?</p>
<p>Metro Exodus has a Native Linux version and it's rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>I have to confess, I still haven't actually gone through and finished Metro Exodus yet. Really enjoyed the gameplay and story in the first two though, so I really should do Exodus at some point. I remember first trying it out on Stadia (R.I.P) and being quite impressed there, and then later the Linux version when it appeared with the Steam release.</p>

      <title>More details on the Manjaro Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" target="_blank">Announced earlier this month</a>, the Orange Pi Neo is a gaming handheld coming out a bit like the Steam Deck but it will be running Manjaro Linux. Recently the Manjaro team gave out a bit more info that was all in a Q&amp;A post on the official Manjaro forum.</p>
<p>This isn't something that was rushed as Manjaro project lead Phillip Müller noted they've worked with Orange Pi on this since May 2023, and the Neo will be released with the first version of Manjaro that's immutable (just like SteamOS on the Steam Deck) named Manjaro Gaming Edition. This will come with special patched versions of <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/gamescope" target="_blank">gamescope</a>, <a href="https://github.com/philmmanjaro/HandyGCCS/tree/neo" target="_blank">handygccs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI" target="_blank">OpenGamepadUI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/tree/neo" target="_blank">hhd</a> and it will have a focus on Flatpaks for extras. It will also ship with the KDE Plasma desktop mode, just like the Steam Deck again. So overall how it will work should be very close to SteamOS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15458384641708089072gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15458384641708089072gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Something many people have been asking for: more handhelds that match up to the software experience on the Steam Deck and not just sticking something on top of Windows to make it slightly less terrible. The thumbpads and an extra USB port are also very welcome.</p>
<p>What they're currently working on getting working:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RGB control still needs to be added to hhd or a dedicated application.</li>
<li>TDP control might work via OpenGamepadUI overlay mode.</li>
<li>controller support still needs to be added to OpenGamepadUI.</li>
<li>fan curves and battery control needs to be optimized.</li>
<li>Audio Equalizer might still need some work to improve audio quality.</li>
<li>Standby and Sleep needs some work in software and firmware to properly work.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They even noted the gyroscope model as a BOSCH 260, which is already supported.</p>
<p>Most importantly: what about pricing and release date? Well the good news on both is that it's not far away with a Q2 2024 target (April - June), and they say the price is aiming for the lower-end of Steam Deck pricing so it sounds like it's going to be really competitive there.</p>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition gets performance improvements, HDR-bloom, bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is still amazingly being updated, although not directly by Beamdog with the community now helping out for fun.</p>
<p>The latest update to this classic RPG was "developed for personal enjoyment and out of goodwill for our fellow players and creators by unpaid software engineers from the NWN community" Beamdog said. Nice to see they're being open to letting others help improve it even further, especially given the age it probably doesn't exactly pull in many sales to continue paying a dedicated team.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14236043081708082634gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14236043081708082634gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New HDR-bloom postprocessing effect accumulates overlapping effects more naturally and makes intense colors bleed into the surrounding pixels.</li>
<li>Improvements to the gameplay UI, such as toggling object highlight by double-pressing TAB.</li>
<li>Significant performance improvements across the board, both on servers and clients.</li>
<li>Many new and improved scripting functions, including support for synchronised audio playback and improvements to the scriptable UI.</li>
<li>Over a hundred bugfixes, including several notorious 20-year-old bugs, such as area objects sometimes showing up too late.</li>
<li>Script compiler is now open source and available as a standalone tool at <a href="https://github.com/niv/neverwinter.nim" target="_blank">https://github.com/niv/neverwinter.nim</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More open source is always nice to see too!</p>
<p>Full changelog on the <a href="https://nwn.beamdog.net/docs/" target="_blank">Beamdog website</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/neverwinter_nights_enhanced_edition_pack?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704450/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Omega Update arrives with a Free Weekend and lots new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Hello games are now working on their open-world survival game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/cautiously-hyped-for-light-no-fire-from-the-no-mans-sky-team-at-hello-games/" target="_blank">Light No Fire</a>, they're not quite done with No Man's Sky just yet with the Omega Update.

<p>If you notice in the trailer at about 1:17, the top left corner notes "More Will Follow", so this is likely not the last update.</p>

      <title>Apple M1 gets OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.2 support on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig announced in a <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> that support for the Apple M1 has been improved, with the latest updates bringing full conformant OpenGL 4.6 on the M1. This includes OpenGL ES 3.2 support too, bumping it up from OpenGL 4.1.</p>
<p>Poking a bit of fun at Apple, Rosenzweig noted "Unlike the vendor’s non-conformant 4.1 drivers, our <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa" target="_blank">open source</a> Linux drivers are <strong>conformant</strong> to the latest OpenGL versions, finally promising broad compatibility with modern OpenGL workloads, like <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, <a href="https://ryujinx.org/" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a>, and <a href="https://citra-emu.org/" target="_blank">Citra</a>."</p>
<p>So for all of you who have a device with the M1, you should hopefully now be able to run even more games and software. OpenGL 4.6 brings with it the likes of compute shaders, SPIR-V, upgraded transform feedback and more.</p>
<p>More from the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the vendor doesn’t yet support graphics standards like modern OpenGL, we do. For this Valentine’s Day, we want to profess our love for interoperable open standards. We want to free users and developers from lock-in, enabling applications to run anywhere the heart wants without special ports. For that, we need standards conformance. Six months ago, we became the <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver.html" target="_blank">first conformant driver for any standard graphics API for the M1</a> with the release of OpenGL ES 3.1 drivers. Today, we’ve finished OpenGL with the full 4.6… and we’re well on the road to Vulkan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The power of Linux and open source at play here once again. The full post is worth a read if you're into learning more behind the scenes on the driver development.</p>

      <title>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 adding EA AntiCheat, breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's only a matter of time before more and more EA published games move over to EA Anti-Cheat, and now Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 is set to get it.</p>
<p>Currently rated as Playable on Steam Deck and Gold on ProtonDB, an update planned for March 2024 will entirely break it on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Announced on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2/news/pvzgw2-anticheat-update" target="_blank">EA website</a>, they said they've "identified an issue affecting our Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 PC players" and so "to create a safe and fair experience for all players, we will be rolling out an update in March 2024 that will transition PVZGW2 for PC over to EA Anticheat".</p>
<p>In the post they clearly say "With this update, we will be ending support for Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 for PC on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 operating systems. Additionally, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 will not run on the native Steam OS for Steamdeck with this update."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13305881121708002003gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13305881121708002003gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So players on Steam Deck / Linux will be left with a broken game. Concerning for many reasons, because once again it shows developers can and will just break their games on certain platforms - even when put through Steam Deck Verified by Valve, it's not a guarantee that the games will continue working unless the developers support the platforms directly.</p>
<p>EA Anti-Cheat is the cause of other games not working too including EA SPORTS FC 24. How long before they include it in other games, like Apex Legends, which is currently Steam Deck Verified?</p>

      <title>Helldivers 2 rated Playable for Steam Deck by Valve</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helldivers 2 is the bug-squashing sensation that's sweeping the nation. Skyrocketing to popularity in a way that the first Helldivers could only dream of. And in a way that caught me off guard if I'm gonna be honest, I barely gave it much thought when it was shown off. Despite that, Helldivers 2 has already surpassed God of War as Playstation's biggest launch on Steam and has easily eclipsed its top-down predecessor in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>The best surprise of Helldivers 2 was that despite its kernel-level anti-cheat system, something that normally kills Linux support, the game ran on Steam Deck. Though not without issues initially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/helldivers-2-is-out-heres-how-to-run-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">running it on the Decks Game Mode</a> due to said anti-cheat affecting Game Mode but Valve quickly put out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-hotfix-updated-to-support-helldivers-2-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Proton Hotfix to solve it</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this change Valve has now rated Helldivers 2 as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable on Steam Deck. The reasons for the playable rating being due to small text that may be difficult to read and the need to manually configure graphics to get good performance on Deck. As for those settings I don't own the game myself so I had to rely on the word of ProtonDB, where Helldivers 2 is rated as Gold for Linux support.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/553850" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> it appears that a mix of Low to Medium settings with FSR set to Ultra Quality can get a mostly solid 30FPS performance. Which is pretty good for a handheld like the Steam Deck. I have no idea if this is for OLED Deck or LCD Deck however so you may have to experiment on your own to figure out the settings that work best for you.</p>

      <title>Cultist Simulator gets much improved Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cultist Simulator was already Steam Deck Verified with Native Linux support but Weather Factory have put out a brand new update, which aims to improve it even further. Always great to see attention to the details!</p>
<p><em>Be sure to check out contributor <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/05/we-review-cultist-simulator-a-game-from-the-creative-talent-behind-sunless-seas/" target="_blank">Scaine's original review of the game</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the update released February 13th the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/718670/view/4052745736467364177" target="_blank">noted</a> they added (amongst a bunch of bug fixes):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck support! A nice excuse to add a QoL/accessibility feature here and there.</li>
<li>Added 150% UI scale.</li>
<li>Added a Font Size setting. May lead to stranger looks on higher ends.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8192695101707918612gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8192695101707918612gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cultist Simulator</em> is a game of apocalypse and yearning from Alexis Kennedy, creator of <em>Fallen London</em> and <em>Sunless Sea</em>. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.<br/>
<br/>
In this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.</p>

      <title>Paradox confirm no Linux support for Prison Architect 2 but investigating Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect 2 from Double Eleven and Paradox Interactive was recently revealed with an entirely new look, and while the original has full Native Linux support, the sequel will not.</p>
<p>Apart from their main grand strategy games developed directly by Paradox, it seems they continue to move away from direct Linux support with all the other games now. Just like we saw with Cities Skylines 2, Star Trek: Infinite, The Lamplighters League and Age of Wonders 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18524169401707917681gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18524169401707917681gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/faq.1624027/#post-29404949" target="_blank">FAQ post</a> on their official forum a Paradox staffer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><strong><u>Will the game have Linux support? Will it be playable on the Steam Deck?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prison Architect 2 is not supported for Linux. We are currently investigating Steam Deck Verification.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you want to play it on Linux or Steam Deck, you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Thankfully, Proton does run almost anything you throw at it nowadays, especially single-player games like this. Still, it's somewhat amusing for developers to not support Linux, but support (or look at supporting) the Steam Deck — which uses SteamOS Linux. But the Steam Deck is a dedicated known platform of course, compared to the many different desktop configurations of Linux. But again, Proton should run it just as well on Desktop Linux if it runs on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Prison Architect 2 is due out on March 26th, and according to the FAQ it will be a "full-fledged game, with old and new features such as the Career mode, the Sandbox mode, and modding tools" and in regards to DLC which Paradox games are pretty notorious to have lots they said "post-launch content and DLCs are not our focus right now".</p>

      <title>DOSBox Staging 0.81.0 out now with new CRT shaders and lots of graphics improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and modern development practices, giving you the great compatibility of classic games with plenty of extras. A new release is available with DOSBox Staging 0.81.0 and it brings with it quite a number of changes to improve a whole lot of games.</p>
<p>The first major change is the removal of their original CRT shaders, with them being replaced by a much better set of 24 CRT shaders they say are "tweaked to perfection to emulate the glorious CRT monitors of the past, including authentic recreations of Hercules, CGA, monochrome CGA, composite CGA, EGA, and VGA monitors". They say you don't need to know much, and no configuration is required at all, as DOSBox Staging will automatically pick the best one based on the current DOS video mode and viewport resolution but you can turn them off if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19894163151707911238gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19894163151707911238gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Gods — 320×200 VGA</p>
<p>Some of the other additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate VGA emulation.</li>
<li>3dfx Voodoo 1 emulation.</li>
<li>New integer scaling modes.</li>
<li>Aspect ratio correct image captures.</li>
<li>Supercharged image and video capturing.</li>
<li>Aspect ratio and viewport enhancements.</li>
<li>A fix for the “black vertical bars” video corruption issue.</li>
<li>New deinterlacing shader for FMV games.</li>
<li>+ much more graphical improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://dosbox-staging.github.io/releases/release-notes/0.81.0/" target="_blank">release notes</a> for the full explanation of each change.</p>

      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whether we're celebrating with loved ones or just staying home alone, Valentines Day is a special day. And what better way to celebrate than by ripping out someones spine or mowing down folks with a shotgun. Well at least that's how I celebrate, and if you wanna celebrate in that way then look no further with Warner Brothers' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/WBGames/sale/bloodyvalentines" target="_blank">Bloody Valentines Day sale.</a></p>

<p>Steam Deck compatibility will also be listed for convenience. Though it should be noted that, despite being listed as Unsupported, Mortal Kombat 11 runs just fine on Steam Deck according to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/976310" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/557569/" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate + Injustice 2 Legendary Edition</a> - ($<s>99.99</s> $9.99)

</ul>
<p>If you're a fighting game fan I don't think you can get a better deal than the combo pack of injustice 2 and MK11. Even if you already own one of the two like I do with MK11, I still think it's an amazing deal. However, if you just wanna dip your toes in the waters of Mortal Kombat then I recommend the MKX deal. It's a shame MK1 isn't included in this sale, that'd be nice if it was.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l2wGGWWKWpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb7697359b88f0b6264cd24903ca33b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l2wGGWWKWpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Really wanted to find a MK11+Injustice 2 bundle trailer. Oh well.</em></p>
<p>As an FPS fan though I've heard great things about F.E.A.R. so this might be a good time for me to snag the collection. Especially as it's the only way to buy the first F.E.A.R. game on Steam for some bizarre reason. I can't speak to Back 4 Blood though, I'd rather play Left 4 Dead 2.</p>
<p>The Bloody Valentine sale can be checked out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/WBGames/sale/bloodyvalentines" target="_blank">on Steam</a> and runs until February 19th at 10AM PST / 6PM UTC, just in case you're waiting on payday to check out these deals.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 hits over half a million Steam user reviews - ranked 19th most popular</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian Studios has managed to hit a mark not many games do, as it's crossed over the half a million mark on Steam for user reviews with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating overall.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steam250.com/reviews" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>, this gives Baldur's Gate 3 the 25th place for most user reviews ever on Steam. There's over 560,000 in total, but only just over 500,000 are counted in the main Steam user rating since Steam only counts direct purchases in that.</p>
<p>And it's also made it to 19th place for the best reviewed game on Steam <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">of all time</a>. Some seriously impressive numbers, especially given that it's less than a year old. Not exactly a big surprise though is it? The game won the GOTY award in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/baldurs-gate-3-wins-game-of-the-year-in-the-2023-steam-awards/" target="_blank">2023 Steam Awards</a> and it seems for good reason — a proper quality full and complete experience at release without lots of micro-transactions and DLC.</p>

<p>Larian is currently <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1755980870664466761" target="_blank">working on</a> Patch 6, which will include quite a number of improvements again like improved romancing, various gameplay improvements and more bug fixes.</p>
<p>How many hours have you put into Baldur's Gate 3? What's your opinion on it? Do you have a favourite moment in the game you want to share? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>I really do love it! Works really great on Desktop Linux with Proton. Easily one of the best games I've played in a long time. Even with some issues here and there, they've been really active on fixing it up and improving it across some huge updates.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>The latest Godot Engine 2023 showreel shows an impressive variety of games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> continues to grow in popularity, and the quality of the games being made with it year after year just keep improving. The latest official Godot showreel is out now.</p>
<p>This year we see a really impressive variety in the art styles and game genre, so even if you're not specifically interested in Godot directly, it's still a really fun look at a whole bunch of upcoming games and apps. A few of which are planning Native Linux support, which is interesting to see considering Godot has some of the best Linux support around for developers.</p>

      <title>Geometry Survivor is a little Geometry Wars and a bit Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes, it continues. The survivor-like bullet-heaven mashup has gained another. Geometry Survivor releases February 21st and should be on the radar of anyone who loved the classic Geometry Wars.</p>
<p>The developer Brain Seal Ltd has seemingly combined the best of both worlds here with lots of upgrades like the survivor games, with the style and chaos of Geometry Wars. In a way, it feels a bit like we've come full circle here. Geometry Wars and various spin-offs and clones were hugely popular some years ago, then developers focused elsewhere, now we have all the Vampire Survivor-likes and here we're going back and blending it all.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogtemkrXtqw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f45a26f1c385c71a576746b8b2459ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogtemkrXtqw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One hand gameplay: Use just one hand to control the direction of your ship.</li>
<li>Auto-Shooter: Your weapons fire automatically, letting you concentrate on staying alive.</li>
<li>Weapons: Each run allows you to get a unique combination of weapons.</li>
<li>Credits: Earn credits and permanently unlock new upgrades.</li>
<li>Enemies: Enjoy the multitude of enemies each with their own AI.</li>
<li>20 minutes of intense gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro visuals and music straight from the 80s.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a key request in for this one, so I'm hoping to take a look at release to see how it runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. I have no doubts thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> that it will work well. Even if it works well, will it be any good? Will it be more than a bit of nostalgia bait? I'm keen to find out.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489010/Geometry_Survivor/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pesticide Not Required blends Vampire Survivors with Atomicrops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's clearly no stopping the rise of games designed like Vampire Survivors, and as usual they keep hooking their teeth into me. The latest is Pesticide Not Required, combining  Vampire Survivors with Atomicrops.</p>
<p>Here it is actually a little bit different, as it also pulls in a little inspiration from Brotato too. It's based on waves, which you deal with through the day and night and right at the end a shop opens to spend your coins gathered from downed enemies. In the shop you buy seeds, which you plant and cultivate and these seeds are also where you get your additional weapons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13465914731707822602gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13465914731707822602gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Pesticide Not Required on Linux</em></p>
<p>There's mining, fishing, pets to help you out, lots of upgrades and the ability to make some really insane character builds to watch the screen fill up with your attacks. I have a feeling this is going to be pretty popular at release, if it manages to cut through the noise of thousands of games releasing on Steam all the time. It has the right idea and the blending of genres like this is done quite well. The mechanics are all simple though, to not overwhelm you so it remains quite accessible.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Season-themed map variations with multiple difficulty levels.</li>
<li>Many unlockable characters with special traits.</li>
<li>Persistent skill tree upgrades.</li>
<li>Quick ~20-minute play sessions.</li>
<li>Tons of achievements to unlock.</li>
<li>Full gamepad and keyboard support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is due out later in Q1 2024. It's gone right to the top of my wishlist - really fun idea.</p>
<p>There's a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479320/Pesticide_Not_Required/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> that worked perfectly with Proton 8.</p>

      <title>Funday Games plan to get Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor bumped to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor launches in Early Access tomorrow (February 14th) and it has now been given a Steam Deck Playable rating. The good news is the developer, Funday Games, plan to improve on that.</p>
<p>An off-shoot of one of my favourite co-op games, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor spins it into a Vampire Survivors like game and the early demos were a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Why is it only Playable and not Verified? Valve noted it has some text that's too small for the Steam Deck screen. In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/4034731337943272264" target="_blank">update post</a> on Steam the developer said clearly "We will be working on getting officially Verified soon after launch." but all other parts of the game work just fine with Valve's verification being done on the latest stable Proton 8.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for Desktop Linux players, that small text won't be an issue on bigger screens.</p>
<p>Release date trailer is below:</p>
