      <title>Raspberry Pi 500 and Raspberry Pi Monitor are available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in time for the holiday season, Raspberry Pi have launched two new bits of hardware for you to tinker with the Raspberry Pi 500 and an official Raspberry Pi Monitor.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <strong>Raspberry Pi 500</strong> is a refresh of their popular all-in-one PC, the Raspberry Pi 400, now powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. The official specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor</li>
<li>8GB LPDDR4X-4267 SDRAM</li>
<li>VideoCore VII GPU, supporting OpenGL ES 3.1 and Vulkan 1.3</li>
<li>Dual 4Kp60 HDMI® display output</li>
<li>Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth 5.0</li>
<li>2 × USB 3.0 ports, supporting simultaneous 5Gbps operation</li>
<li>1 × USB 2.0 port</li>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet port</li>
<li>Horizontal 40-pin Raspberry Pi GPIO connector</li>
</ul>
<p>You also get an official 32GB Micro-SD card bundled with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18953909161733749955gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Really brings back some memories of one of my first loves, the Amiga!</em></p>
<p>As for the Raspberry Pi Monitor it's a '15.6″ full HD IPS panel with a 45% colour gamut and an 80° viewing angle'. You get a pair of 1.2W speakers, a fold-away stand, VESA mounting points and power via USB-C. It can be powered directly by a Raspberry Pi too, although brightness gets limited to 60% and volume to 50%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12090045001733749956gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>With these launched, they've also now reduced the price on the Raspberry Pi 400 from $70 to $60, and the Raspberry Pi 400 Personal Computer Kit from $100 to $80. They're also now bundling a Micro-SD card with the Raspberry Pi 400.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31 released with first-party YouTube Chat features, new NVIDIA filters and Linux improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio has a brand new stable release available! The awesome free and open source video capture tool OBS Studio <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.0.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">31.0.0</a> is out now. <em>This release went live on December 7th.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the release notes the main new features are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added NVIDIA Blur Filter and Background Blur.</li>
<li>Added preview scrollbars and zoom/scale indicator.</li>
<li>Added v210 format support for AJA device capture.</li>
<li>Added Amazon IVS service integration.</li>
<li>Added QSV AV1 Screen Content Coding.</li>
<li>Enabled first-party YouTube Chat features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18667317511733749234gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's various other improvements and fixes, including some tweak for the Linux client like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed display and window capture on Linux to not capture implicitly.</li>
<li>Improved screensaver inhibit functions on Linux in Flatpak</li>
<li>Disabled the (currently unsupported) built-in Automatic Scene Switcher when using Wayland on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes with the QSV encoder on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux when importing a scene collection created on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/11232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to display / window capture is a nice one, that will stop it automatically capturing a window without you directly telling it to, something that has been a problem for a long time.</p>
<p>At time of writing that <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.obsproject.Studio" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> package has not yet been updated. Hopefully soon since it's been a few days since the release.</p>

      <title>EA pledge another 23 accessibility patents for public royalty-free use</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA did another actually genuinely great thing here. They've expanded their previous patent pledge for game developers to use without problems.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/ea-open-source-fonttik-helps-devs-check-text-size-a-contrast-m-plus-patent-pledges/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original pledge</a> a few years ago included the open source Fonttik tool along with six accessibility patents for public use, which they then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/ea-opens-up-more-patents-for-increasing-accessibility-in-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expanded in 2023</a> to include more patents for developers to use. This has expanded once again to include another 23 patents focused on accessibility that developers are free to use.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/2024-accessibility-patent-pledge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These newly pledged patents cover technologies to improve speech recognition, generate more personalized speech and simplify the use of speech recognition technologies in computing and gaming devices.  </p>
<p>Among other things, these patented accessibility technologies could be used to improve the gameplay experience of players who have speech disability or who prefer or need assistance with verbally expressing themselves. They could make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language and speaking style. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that they've also open sourced their <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IRIS plugin</a> for Unreal Engine, which allows in-engine use of EA's photosensitivity analysis tech, <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/iris" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IRIS</a>, which was previously open sourced.</p>
<p>What does it actually mean? EA allow the use of all the listed patents royalty-free, so they will not go after any game developer that chooses to implement features the patents describe.</p>
<p>It's good to see patents be used in this way. Many companies use patents to go after other companies, so it's quite refreshing to see a publisher as big as EA stock them up to not just protect themselves, but for others too.</p>

      <title>Steam sets a new record with 39 million concurrent users online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend the Steam store from Valve managed to smash another record, something it has done repeatedly this year and it shows no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the new concurrent user record of people online is 39,205,447 as of Sunday, December 8th at 2PM UTC. At the time 12,090,313 people were actually in-game as well.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Based on peak player counts, over the last 24 hours the top games were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ol>
<p>No surprise really to see Steam hitting a record with both Path of Exile 2 and Marvel Rivals releasing over the last week. Both of them have been absolute monster releases with their peak player counts together hitting over a million.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some history for you of recent milestones of people online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-breaks-38-million-concurrent-users-for-the-first-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2024 - 38 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-sets-a-new-record-with-372-million-concurrent-users-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 2024 - 37 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-breaking-records-again-hitting-over-36-million-players-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 36 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-broke-another-record-with-over-35-million-people-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 35 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-smashes-its-peak-players-online-record-to-over-34-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 34 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-breaks-more-records-with-33-million-online-and-over-10-million-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">January 2023 - 33 million</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can clearly see 2024 has been an absolute knock-out year for Valve. Steam was already a money-printing machine, and it seems now even more so.</p>

      <title>Minimalist mini-game filled survival city-builder Dawnfolk gets a release date and new demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dawnfolk from developer Darenn Keller is absolutely lovely, a minimalist survival city-builder with each tile having a little mini-game. Really unique and one you need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed it's going to launch on February 13th, which will have full Native Linux support, and there's even a brand new expanded demo you can try too.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Dawnfolk, you will explore an uncharted medieval fantasy world, manage resources, build cities, and survive against many dangers. Minigames add a unique challenge to supporting your people. The better you are at the minigames, the more resources you get and the more likely your community will weather the darkness. Every choice matters as you explore different strategies and play styles in Dawnfolk."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>itch.io store was taken down by Funko due to &#34;trash AI Powered&#34; phishing report</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This was an interesting one to come back to today. Game store <a href="https://itch.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> was taken offline recently, due to a "bogus Phishing report to our registrar".</p>
<p>For people who don't understand how websites work, there was no issue with their data on their actual hosting server, the problem was with the web address. Their domain registrar disabled their domain name itch.io directly, due to what itch said was a "bogus Phishing report".</p>
<p>Speaking in a social media post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3lcu6h465bs2n" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the official itch account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I kid you not, @itch.io has been taken down by Funko of "Funko Pop" because they use some trash "AI Powered" Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow up <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866022784222245305" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X / Twitter (they didn't post this to Bluesky), the itch account mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, for transparency, we *did* take the disputed page down as soon as we got the notice because it's not worth fighting stuff like that. Regardless, our registrar's automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It seems to be back up now.</em></p>
<p>What this does is highlight how anything like this should be manually reviewed first. Automated systems should not be able to take down such a high-profile and long-running website like itch. There's a lot of problems with how this was handled by both Funko / Brand Shield and iwantmyname.</p>
<p>It's an ongoing long-running problem across the whole web. Things can be taken down so easily without confirmation anywhere. The whole take-down system is just full of flaws and gets abused all the time, just look at YouTube, people have complained about it there forever.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 now in Early Access and it works on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Path of Exile 2 from Grinding Gear Games has officially arrived, although it's not quite finished yet as it's in Early Access. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The developer didn't reply to my request, so I've only just briefly jumped in today to check and see if it actually runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. The good news there — is that it does! The game does launch right out of the box with the <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear said they expect it to remain in Early Access for "as long as needed" which they expect will be "at least 6 months". Even though it's not done, it's still absolutely huge. There's somewhere around 400 different types of monsters, about 50 bosses and a whole lot of end-game content to play through. This game will keep you going for a long time, just as the first game did.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VZsq_vJjGk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aed43cd7b1d2cb5ac150ca9cd9384157.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VZsq_vJjGk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Testing on a Steam Deck LCD 512GB, with the game on the SSD and the game loaded up fine! Gamepad input detected as soon as I moved a thumbstick and so away we go. The game is definitely playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Performance has been a bit…<strong>strange</strong>. On the lowest settings I've seen times where the same area will barely hold 30-40FPS, and other times it will give me a <em>drastically</em> smoother 50-60FPS. It's been thoroughly confusing that's for sure, and I've had to re-write this section a few times after doing repeated testing when fully reloading the game. So, your mileage here may vary, it <em>might</em> perform well for you, it <em>might</em> not. Entirely possible it's some server instancing issue messing with the performance at times.</p>
<p>Pictures below on Low settings, AMD FSR Performance, 60FPS limit, Dynamic Resolution On:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11400292831733528660gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11400292831733528660gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5120963571733529376gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5120963571733529376gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>You won't get much more than 1hr 30mins on the LCD Steam Deck battery.</em></p>
<p>One big problem though is that lots of the text is small. There's some UI scaling, but seemingly no text scaling, so I still had to pull the deck up close to my face to read some parts. Especially annoying for a game like this, where you'll be reading over items and skills quite often. Higher levels of UI scaling can also cause some parts of the UI to go off the Steam Deck screen cutting it off.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46868441733524805gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/46868441733524805gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18218564251733525035gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18218564251733525035gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>That was one heck of a boss fight…</em></p>
<p>There's also some clear bugs, with it being in Early Access and all, like my first crash to my Steam Library when entering a portal the game just threw this up at me:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7044950191733525449gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7044950191733525449gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Overall: definitely playable! I just hope the <em>weird</em> performance issue is figured out.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux</strong></p>
<p>Considering it ran on the Steam Deck, I wasn't expecting any trouble on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with an AMD GPU and as expected, no real issues there.</p>
<p>However, for <u>NVIDIA</u> users, you may see a black screen. One fix there is to force the game into DirectX12 mode, which it seems you need to do directly in a configuration file. This file can be found somewhere like this depending on where you have it installed:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2694490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2/poe2_production_Config.ini</code></p>
<p>Inside there set "renderer_type=DirectX12" on Line 7 (it will be Vulkan by default). Then you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Another <em>potential</em> fix I've been told that works with NVIDIA is to run the game with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>.</p>
<p>On mostly High settings with my Ryzen 5800x, Radeon 6800 XT:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7070744651733526292gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7070744651733526292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Initial Launch Issues</strong></p>
<p>The actual launch was just a <em>bit</em> rocky, with the login not working as the developer had to do some truly last-minute <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098048571113779" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">upgrades</a> on their database system. So over 400,000 people we're playing a loading screen simulator. I'm not exactly complaining though. Launching games is <em>hard</em>, especially online connected games such as this when a ridiculous amount of people are trying to jump in all at the same time. The community even <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1865128830907605273" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">took down</a> SteamDB as people were hammering it trying to see what was happening.</p>
<p>Still, when the servers went up, seeing then 19,658 people ahead of me in a queue was quite <em>frustrating </em>to say the least. A queue that seemed like it wasn't actually going anywhere. Got there eventually though, <em>only</em> another 5 minutes staring at the red number of people ticking down until it was my turn. At last! At least, that's what I <em>thought</em>, I had a brief 30 seconds of bliss with a cut-scene and the game booted me back to the login screen. A "configuration problem" the developer <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865134494321455276" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> this time.</p>
<p>40 or so minutes later, and I'm back into a queue. Just a few ahead of me, <em>only</em> 17,430 people and so another 4 minutes sat watching it tick down again. Got there eventually…for 5 minutes, then the London Realm and others <a href="https://vxtwitter.com/pathofexile/status/1865145572875018750" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">went down</a> and I was kicked out again. At this point, you get the idea, the launch has <em>not</em> been the best. Clearly, the <em>login screen</em> is the hardest boss of them all.</p>
<p>Anyway. Wonderful to see <em>another</em> huge game launch working on Linux platforms at release just like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>

      <title>Pizza-delivery bullet heaven Pest Apocalypse is hilarious chaos - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pest Apocalypse from Kikimora Games is out now, a fresh Bullet Heaven blending together the worlds of Vampire Survivors with something like Crazy Taxi and it's thoroughly chaotic. I've made this joke before, and I'll do it again, this is VANpire Survivors.<em> Look it's a good joke okay.</em></p>
<p>What you get here is a quality mixture of mechanics. The repeated runs of building up a crazy combination of weapons and abilities popularized by Vampire Survivors, but with the spin on it that you're in a fast-moving vehicle equipped with a nitro boost. Each pizza you deliver enables you to pick a new passenger with their own weapon, and you really can make a pretty wild ride.</p>
<p>The developer sent over a release key and I've been having a real blast with it, sending my little van speeding across the map to collect and deliver one pizza after another, while also being chased by hordes of creatures.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sq14-U58btM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df396ee8f245302b099ac05ba9455e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sq14-U58btM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only do you get to pick various passengers (weapons) after you do a successful delivery, but there's also a weapon upgrade system too. As you wheel-spin and drift your way around the map squishing all sorts of creatures, you can collect blue upgrade orbs they drop to level up, and depending on how many you have when you deliver the pizza, you'll then be able to further enhance your weapons.</p>
<p>Aside from that there's a meta upgrade system too. As you progress through a run you'll earn tips for doing a good job, which you can then use in the main menu to do meta upgrades like passenger damage output, attack cooldown, max vehicle health and more.</p>
<p>I also really love the silly cinematic camera that appears when you launch your vehicle over ramps. A fun little touch. It's a game that only gets funnier the more you play it. Across the maps you can find temporary pickups too like a big ball with spikes attached by a chain to your van. The physics in Pest Apocalypse can be a little funky, but that only adds to the comedic charm here I think.</p>
<p>Very similar in style to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/earl-vs-the-mutants-is-choatic-survivor-like-fun-with-vehicles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl vs. the Mutants</a> that I looked at previously, but here you have a specific purpose pushing you on to keep going, and in terms of style, overall feel and content - Pest Apocalypse is a bigger and better game (with a higher price to match). Pest Apocalypse also has Native Linux support, built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Pest Apocalypse is surprisingly challenging too, a lot more so than I would say other Bullet Heaven games are. Partly due to the vehicle speed and your turning circle, making dodging enemies all that more challenging. But also the vehicle health, it doesn't actually take much to get destroyed if you're not careful. All that only adds to the intense feeling of needing <em>just one more drive</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910352511733501491gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910352511733501491gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Another nice feature is that you have a tip level. I mentioned earlier that you gain tips for all the deliveries, but this adds up to its own special counter as well and each time it levels up after run you then get to pick a special unlock as well. This could be new drops from enemies that will appear during a run, new passengers (weapons), items and more.</p>
<p>No problems at all on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with the Linux version. Pest Apocalypse is also pretty much a perfect Steam Deck game. Performance is good and the runs are reasonably short too.</p>
<p>A very firm recommendation. Now I need van to come and deliver me some pizza. For now I'll settle for another run to see what ridiculous weapon combo I can make. Go get it, great fun.</p>

      <title>MMO interplanetary crafting adventure SpaceCraft from Shiro Games (Northgard, Wartales) announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shiro Games developer of Northgard, Wartales and Dune: Spice Wars have announced SpaceCraft, and my space-nerd brain is now very excited. It's a "massively multiplayer interplanetary crafting adventure" according to the press email, whatever that actually means.</p>
<p>Looks like it will have a big mixture of gameplay with free open-world exploration across the stars, along with you being able to explore planets directly on the ground as well. On the planets you can mine for resources, do some crafting, build a base and there's even automation systems as well. The actual spaceships look modular with you building them up from various components, and the economy will be player-driven as well. </p>
<p>Overall it seems like a bit of a blend of Eve Online, Satisfactory and Avorion. Which could be awesome, although likely a huge timesink. Have a looksie at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bdd0avB3t-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875b5d7dc81828ab3e5d50db018f52a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bdd0avB3t-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We wanted to give players a spectacular open-ended world to explore, where their decisions have an impact and they have full freedom to choose their own destiny,” said Nicolas Cannasse, CEO of Shiro Games. “Build complex starships and bases, conduct trade deals in a real-time economy, and form alliances and rivalries at your discretion. From the time you start the game, SpaceCraft is your story to tell.”</p>
<p>Hopefully it will work well on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> with no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> annoyances. Right to the top of my wishlist it goes.</p>

      <title>Epic science fantasy roguelike Caves of Qud 1.0 is out now and it&#39;s a wild ride</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud is a proper roguelike, with deep science fantasy lore and after 15+ years of development it is finally finished with the 1.0 release now available. Easily one of the best roguelikes ever made, a game not to be missed, even if you're not usually into the genre it's just a wild ride to play through.</p>
<p>I adore everything about this game from the wild characters you can make with all sorts of insane abilities and mutations, to their deep descriptions and lore on everything in the world. Even the doors and walls have descriptions on them, the game is just massively detailed in every way. The new UI is also a thing of retro beauty.</p>
<p>My latest character was a fun one. I had the ability to fire an electromagnetic pulse, with heightened hearing, night vision, i could make a force bubble around myself, create a force wall to protect myself and reflect mental attacks back at enemies. However, my character also suffers from Amnesia, and tends to forget things at times…</p>
<p>Thankfully there's multiple game modes, so you can make it a bit more adventure-like and less punishing if you wish to explore it more easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4nG-N_jtpZI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d66c750a3eb8ce7c073b04be62dc31b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4nG-N_jtpZI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">New as of the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial to teach the basics of the game.</li>
<li>Final quest in the main questline &amp; the end of the game.</li>
<li>Several new music tracks, sound effects, and items.</li>
<li>40 new achievements.</li>
<li>Lots of bugfixes and small feature improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the 1.0 launch there's also the new  Dromad Deluxe edition that includes the game, the original soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC to pick from 13 unique companions to start the game with.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<p>“It's hard to think of<em> Caves of Qud</em> as anything other than our life's work,” says Jason Grinblat, Founder and Designer at Freehold Games. “We've been making it for almost 20 years now, and the success it has already, has felt like a fever dream. It's so easy to imagine we're still in Brian's converted garage working on the game for our three friends. The prospect of it finally arriving at 1.0 is thrilling, dizzying... exhausting. We're looking forward to Kitfox's support after launch so we can crawl under our desks and sleep for a few months. Anyway, please play it!”</p>
<p>It's launched with Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Flathub to become a self-sustaining entity and they&#39;re looking to hire someone to help</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> has positioned itself as pretty much the go-to place for Linux apps, since it works across many distributions and is even on the Steam Deck. Now, the GNOME Foundation are looking to hire someone to help expand it into a self-sustaining entity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/request-for-proposals-flathub-program-management/8276" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on the Flathub Discourse Forum, the GNOME Foundation are looking to hire a contractor to help sort through management, legal and financial stuff with it being funded by Endless. This is all also being done in partnership with KDE e.V. too.</p>
<p>The budget for it seems pretty low though at $12,000 for an expected 3 months of part-time work on it. To me it seems a bit overly optimistic on how long this sort of thing would take to be fully sorted. Especially when you look at what the role entails like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Oversee deployment of payment systems for applications and direct donations to Flathub operating costs.</li>
<li>Finalise governance documents and convene a simple governing body for Flathub with representatives from GNOME, KDE and the Flathub community.</li>
<li>Establish and manage bank and Stripe payment processing accounts.</li>
<li>Finalize and launch terms of use and developer agreements.</li>
<li>Coordinate handling of accounting, operations and expenses with the GNOME Foundation.</li>
<li>Ensure transparency through clear communications and documentation for the community.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully something is worked out, because Flathub has become a seriously good thing for the Linux desktop.</p>

      <title>Free to play Marvel Rivals is out now on Steam and works on Steam Deck / Linux (Steam Deck has issues though)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel Rivals is the next big multiplayer shooter and potentially the next "big thing", with a Steam free to play release now live. What is it? Pretty much Marvel Overwatch.</p>
<p>The good news, is that it <em>does</em> actually work on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Not only that, this is <em>not</em> a case of it accidentally working either, it's supported. Straight from the developer in their Discord one of their team <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1202076175355355176/1314354112812290048" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> very clearly: "Yes Steam Deck supported. Bugs on black cutscenes".</p>
<p><em>There's clear issues right now though. So here's how to get it working on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>When you go to play it on Steam Deck / Linux you may encounter errors about drivers and the operating system, which can be safely ignored. On Steam Deck, I just needed to use the touch screen to tap the confirmation boxes and then hit play on the launcher.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16243454001733477819gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16243454001733477819gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5059451721733477819gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5059451721733477819gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>After it's loaded shaders, at least with Proton 9.0-3, you will end up seeing black screens with audio playing, which the developer mentioned in my quote above. The good news, is that's an easy fix!</p>
<p><strong>How to fix Marvel Rivals on Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Go into Desktop Mode (STEAM button - Power - Switch to Desktop) and run Marvel Rivals from there. Once it loads the launcher you can control the mouse by holding down the STEAM button and using the Right Thumbpad to move the mouse, with Right Trigger as your mouse button to hit the buttons in the launcher and you can then get into the game properly.</p>
<p>The initial black screen is supposed to show their privacy acceptance screen and agreement screen, which only seem to work in Desktop Mode. Here you can use a mixture of touch-screen and mouse input to get through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19164423381733479146gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>After that though, it wants you to enter a username, and since you're in Desktop Mode you <em>can't</em> bring up a keyboard overlay on top of the game properly. So hit the Power button <em>once</em>, select Log Out and it sends you back to Gaming Mode. Then launch the game again, and it will work properly.</p>
<p>You'll still see <em>some</em> black screens though, but if you swap Marvel Rivals over to <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> (Properties -&gt; Compatibility) they seem to be fixed with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14093559831733479037gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>So it's a bit of work, that will likely be made easier with updates to Proton from Valve and updates to the game. I'm sure Valve will figure out what causes the black screens with the agreement acceptance and get it fixed.</p>
<p>Performance on Steam Deck is not especially great, and cut-scenes lag quite a lot. Actual gameplay is playable enough though, once you turn the settings onto Low and put FSR onto Performance.</p>
<p>Pictures below on Low / FSR Balanced:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13309122041733479753gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13309122041733479753gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10775312451733479799gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10775312451733479799gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Over on Desktop Linux, sticking with <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> as noted above to sort any black screens, and the experience is about what I expected. No issue getting it working there. You still get the driver / operating system version errors to click away but the privacy acceptance screens show up as normal, and you can get into Marvel Rivals without an issue at all.</p>
<p>Picture below on Kubuntu 24.10 Desktop, Ultra settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19770803471733480764gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19770803471733480764gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've been enjoying trying it out, as a fan of games like it, and so far the gameplay is actually really fun, as are the designs of all the characters with their abilities. Looking forward to playing more of Marvel Rivals on Linux.</p>

      <title>Valve may be working on a new kind of Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a whole bunch of hints and speculation going around right now, showing that Valve may be working towards a new kind of Steam Machine. Suddenly, their new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller 2 that was leaked</a>, along with the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valves-new-branding-guidelines-hint-at-steam-decks-steamos-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS branding guidelines</a> make a whole lot more sense if this is true.</p>
<p>While the SteamOS branding mentions third-party vendors using it, and we know they're working towards releasing SteamOS for other hardware vendors for their handhelds, having a standard way to show it also helps Valve keep it the same across multiple of their own devices.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Controller 2, it makes even more sense with this because otherwise the target for people to buy it would have been reasonably small. Sure there's all the people with a Steam Deck, but it would be only a percentage of people with one that would buy a Steam Controller 2, and a lot of other people on PC already have their preferred gamepad. So, having a fresh Steam Machine would pretty much <em>need</em> a dedicated controller, unless Valve bundled it with a third-party controller, but that leaves Valve at the mercy of another hardware vendor on features and support.</p>
<p>The <em>speculation</em> and leaks on some form of new Steam Machine from Valve come initially from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1h7521g/looks_like_valve_is_working_on_a_steamos_device/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>, where a user pointed out a <a href="https://gitlab.com/evlaV/linux-integration/-/commit/3d92f93a76012f9dc9cb2d75eb0da7ecc93b9bd2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to the Linux kernel used by Steam Deck / SteamOS. It mentions a change for HDMI CEC for Fremont, with code that references AMD Lilac. Lilac on <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=amd+lilac" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Geekbench</a> being a mixture of different AMD chips like the Ryzen 8540U and Ryzen 7735HS.</p>
<p>On X / Twitter, VR enthusiast Brad Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1864817868346360011" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in a thread after more digging through Valve's code noting "But also that Quanta Computer, Valve’s Steam Deck manufacturer, is giving feedback on it" and "All references to Fremont ensure checks for a full-size HDMI Type-A port you’d see on TV-focused consoles and other desktop computers that don’t have a dedicated GPU with its own HDMI ports". Lynch is the one that has been covering a lot of the leaks for the upcoming Valve Deckard VR headset.</p>
<p>November next year will also mark 10 years since Valve's original Steam Machine launch. That would be a pretty good time for Valve to announce something don't you think?</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically since the original failure of the Steam Machine launch, which kicked off Valve's effort on everything that made up the Steam Deck. We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> now, the real important bit, which runs tens of thousands of Windows games and Proton compatibility is continuously improving to the point where so many games really do just work (but we still have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> problem). We have another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-90-4-beta-updated-with-more-game-fixes-needing-testing-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big update to Proton 9 coming soon</a> too.</p>
<p>It's going to be really interesting to see what becomes of all this. Very exciting time to be a Linux / SteamOS gamer.</p>

      <title>Free to play monster-hunting game Dauntless now on Steam and works on Steam Deck, desktop Linux needs a quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dauntless from Phoenix Labs has finally launched on Steam, it's also free to play so you can go and check out this monster-hunting game without spending a penny.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/331370/discussions/0/4635987888980475489/#c4635988522932731095" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam clearly back in late November: "We have no intentions to intentionally block Steam Deck compatibility!", and it has launched with Easy Anti-Cheat. There's no official Steam Deck compatibility rating from Valve just yet though, and the developer hasn't officially noted any supported status for Steam Deck apart from that quote so far.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0eZC5ITT7f0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/87e7273a655edf3be32e3e392a41d48f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0eZC5ITT7f0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Giving it a test-run myself on Steam Deck with Proton 9.0-3, the game does launch correctly and shows Easy Anti-Cheat initializing. The game <em>requires</em> an Epic Games Account, which I had already previously linked with Steam for a different game, so I just had to use the touch screen to allow the game to be linked to it and after that gamepad input then worked correctly.</p>
<p>So it seems at launch, at least right now, it does indeed work on Steam Deck. Sticking it into Low overall details and the performance looked pretty good too above 50FPS. Not quite keeping 60FPS, but still pretty good, a few dips down into the 40s during heavy combat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8522697711733427853gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8522697711733427853gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>One odd issue I have encountered, is that some display modes cause the resolution on the menu to be quite broken. Keeping it in Borderless Window works fine. Apart from that, it all appears to work pretty well, running around the city and engaging in a few battles with other players.</p>
<p>Dauntless has a text scaling option too, which I set to larger so it's easier to read although there's still a couple of places with really small text.</p>
<p>I also tested it on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) <em>but</em> here across both Proton 9.0-3 and Proton Experimental Easy Ant-Cheat gives me a "Client game integrity violation error". A workaround, at least for now, is to pretend your desktop is a Steam Deck with this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>The official word I got back from their press team over email today is that "the Dauntless anti-cheat is Steam Deck compatible and they’ll be making further improvements to Steam Deck functionality".</p>

      <title>War Thunder is moving away from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After doing the same with their FPS, Enlisted, Gaijin have announced today that War Thunder will also be changing the anti-cheat system used. This may, potentially, cause some momentary breakage.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9247-war-thunder-anti-cheat-system-update-en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned War Thunder will be moving over to BattlEye, which is already supported on Linux (for both Native Linux builds and Proton). They currently use Easy Anti-Cheat for it and no reason has actually been given as to why they decided to swap over.</p>
<p>The move makes sense though, keeping their games using the same anti-cheat system. They've supported Linux for a long time now too, being one of the earlier few bigger developers to get involved, so I don't personally expect any real problems here. Especially since Enlisted also works on Linux right now with both games having a Native Linux build available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8811809991733424521gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They said the changeover is going to happen in waves, so you might not see BattlEye on your own system for a few weeks. Eventually everyone will be on it, but they'll of course continue supporting those still on Easy Anti-Cheat until the switchover is complete.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 565.77 stable driver for Linux released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have today released driver version 565.77 as their latest stable New Feature Branch build available for Linux, pulling in all the changes from the 565.57.01 Beta plus a whole bunch more improvements.</p>
<p>For people who <em>didn't</em> use the 565.57.01 Beta or didn't see it, these were the initial changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause suspend/resume to fail when using the NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations option: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the cursor image to be truncated on Gamescope: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099</a></li>
<li>Re-enabled GLX_EXT_buffer_age on Xwayland. This extension had been previously disabled on Xwayland due to a bug which is now fixed.</li>
<li>Added support for mmap of exported DMA-BUF objects.</li>
<li>Reduced some cases of stutter with OpenGL syncing to vblank while using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that could cause some applications to exit due to resource exhaustion on some GPUs while using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Added several new per-plane and per-CRTC vendor-specific properties to nvidia-drm. These properties may be used by Wayland compositors to program the GPU's color pipeline for HDR hardware acceleration.</li>
<li>Introduced a driver optimization to mitigate the performance loss from the 'd3d9.floatEmulation' option in DXVK.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused FarCry 5 running through DXVK to display a black screen.</li>
<li>Updated the framelock settings page of the nvidia-settings control panel to use the GTK3 theme text color rather than defaulting to white for the text color, improving legibility with some themes.</li>
<li>Fixed some performance regressions that were observed with Vkd3d 2.9.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause flickering in some applications when using Unified Back Buffer (UBB).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause incorrect and/or washed out colors to be displayed with HDR scanout: <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780</a></li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause kernel crashes upon attempting KMS operations through DRM when nvidia_drm was loaded with modeset=0.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what's <strong>new from this 565.77 release</strong> that was promoted as a stable driver here's all the changes on top of the above list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in i2c handling that caused the OpenRGB Application to set incorrect LED colors on some NVIDIA GPUs. <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/41" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/41</a></li>
<li>Changed the fallback preference from 10 BPC YUV422 to 8 BPC RGB + dithering when enabling HDR scanout with limited display bandwidth.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when using X11 forwarding on some systems.</li>
<li>Added a new application profile key, "GLVidHeapReuseRatio", to control the amount of memory OpenGL may hold for later reuse, as well as some application profiles for several Wayland compositors using the new key to work around issues with excessive video memory usage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to crashes when a Vulkan application waits on a VkFence created by importing a DRM syncobj. This solves some crashes observed with Unreal Engine and other applications on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause KDE Plasma 6 to crash when running as a Wayland compositor.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the driver stack to fail to load the correct state of a Quadro Sync board when GSP is enabled. This would lead to inaccuracies in reporting framelock state when using house sync or stereo signals.</li>
<li>Updated the kernel module build process to use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT from the Linux kernel's Kconfig to detect the compiler used to build the kernel. This may help select the correct compiler on systems where the kernel was built with a compiler other than the default one.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented kernel modules linked using precompiled kernel interface files from loading on recent Debian systems.</li>
<li>Improved the ability of nvidia-modprobe to detect whether kernel modules are already loaded. This corrects an issue that prevented nvidia-persistenced from setting persistence mode on some systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see that NVIDIA are continuing to clearly list the changes since their direct previous release, which is something I asked them to do at the start of this year. Previously, they were listing every single change each release when moving drivers between their named branches, which caused confusion.</p>
<p>See all in their <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/237598/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Prime Gaming December 5th edition for Steam Deck / Linux - a bunch of special extras were added this week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>We already had one this week because Amazon did a double-drop. But not only that, they also surprise-dropped a bunch of <strong>extra</strong> games <em>today</em> that they <em>didn't</em> previously announce in support of their new Secret Level series. Some good stuff here for you.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Deep survival game Vintage Story has another massive update approaching in v1.20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a survival game with some impressively deep game mechanics, and the v1.20 update is another major one that's coming out soon with a first Release Candidate available to test. Probably one of my favourite survival games to keep checking back on, that's really like nothing else.</p>
<p>This update will add in some truly massive upgrades for the game. Not just in terms of gameplay additions, but upgrades to their engine to bring some big visual and physics improvements too.</p>
<p>Speaking about the update the developer said in an <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/v120-rc1-lore-update-the-journey-r389/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary focus of this update was on delivering the second major chapter in our game's story. There are 4 new unique story locations that require long distance travel to reach them. Long distance travel is enhanced by two new transport systems - the Elk for land based travel and the Sailboat for traversing bodies of water.<br/>
The team worked really hard on this one. We powered through natural disasters, family emergencies, unforeseen technical challenges, unfulfilled ambitions and various other roadblocks. I probably sound like a broken record by now, but again we seem to have ended up building one of the largest updates so far. Turns out that hiring more game developers does not speed up development, it just makes us all way more ambitious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Just a few cherry-picked additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal riding system and Elk ownership system.</li>
<li>Expanded ocean content and a visual upgrade for water.</li>
<li>A sailboat with a full construction system, and an upgraded raft.</li>
<li>Hundreds of new types of blocks.</li>
<li>Tiny little bouncy and noisy insects.</li>
<li>Added solar eclipses.</li>
<li>Lots of creature AI improvements.</li>
<li>Two new secret mobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C5v8NaRVIyk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3120949d862aac61445c0c0d255a83b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C5v8NaRVIyk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support. However, it seems they need to update their supported version of dotnet from 7.0, which is no longer supported by Microsoft, so running it on an up to date distro may be a little annoying right now.</p>

      <title>Steam Bullet Heaven Festival 2.0 is live to show off the explosive growth of the genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bullet Heavens are all the rage right now from Vampire Survivors to Brotato and everything in between them, so Valve launched have a little mini festival to celebrate them all. Weirdly, Vampire Survivors is not included in the festival, but then it also doesn't exactly need any promotion at this point since it was a runaway success.</p>
<p>The genre has absolutely exploded, with developer after developer chasing the trend to bring out their own version of it and honestly — I couldn't be happier. Some of my favourite and most-played games belong in this genre and I'm always excited to see what unique spin each developer puts on it.</p>
<p>What's the difference between Bullet Heavens and Bullet Hells? Well, in a Bullet Heaven, you are the one mostly spamming-out the attacks against hordes of enemies, rather than dodging all their attacks like you would in a Bullet Hell. That's about the simplest way to describe it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the games think I think you need to check out or keep an eye on include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">20 Minutes Till Dawn</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2181610/Heretics_Fork/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heretic's Fork</a><br/>
<em>Technically this one is Tower Defense, but it's in the festival and the gameplay does fit in.</em></li>

</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/BulletHeaven2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">festival on Steam</a>. It runs until December 11th.</p>
<p>Since clearly Bullet Heaven has been basically set as the name for the genre, I've also now set up a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Bullet_Heaven/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bullet Heaven tag</a> for such games going forward here on GamingOnLinux.</p>

      <title>Delta Force developer mentions they will look at supporting Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new Delta Force has launched with kernel level anti-cheat, which sadly doesn't support Linux platforms yet but it seems hope for it is not entirely lost. Not to be confused with the original Delta Force from 1998, this is a free to play online FPS from Team Jade and TiMi Studio Group.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Writing on the Steam forum, one of the developers clearly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/4509877583653226327/#c4638240954399142658" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is currently not supported. And Steam Deck is also not supported at the moment, but we will start considering how to port it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> though, they don't actually need to <em>port</em> the game like they would for other platforms, the developers just need to ensure their anti-cheat system "Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE)" is enabled for it. Although it's not clear if that will be as easy as it is for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/epic-games-announce-full-easy-anti-cheat-for-linux-including-wine-a-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18849762481733392433gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Trying it anyway on Desktop Linux through Proton 9.0-3, Proton Experimental and GE-Proton 9.20 they all resulted in the launcher login system giving repeating network errors when trying to login, eventually through repeat attempts I could get to the main Launch button - but then the launcher just quits back to the Steam Library.</p>
<p>Curiously, on Steam Deck with SteamOS 3.6, Proton 9.0-3 had the same issues but Proton Experimental <em>did</em> get into the game. Repeatedly testing Proton Experimental on Steam Deck and yes, it <em>does</em> go in-game. So back to Desktop and it still doesn't work there.</p>
<p>Regardless of it randomly working or not, given the anti-cheat system and the <em>clear</em> statement of it <u>not</u> being supported by the developer, it could fully stop working at any time or result in game bans. It's not worth it right now. Save your time downloads and hard drive space for something else.</p>
<p>You can keep an eye on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see what games work or not for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Please leave feedback for the list in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/6277/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum announcement post</a>.</p>
<p>When I hear any different for Delta Force, I'll be sure to let you know in a future article.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s new branding guidelines hint at Steam Deck&#39;s SteamOS for more devices </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we've known for a while that Valve plan to get SteamOS Linux on devices other than the Steam Deck, we don't know when that will happen, but we've got another hint here that things are moving along.</p>
<p>Since the release of the Steam Deck, Valve have repeatedly said it's in their plans to release SteamOS 3 to the public and for hardware vendors to ship on their devices. The joke about <em>Valve Time</em> is as relevant as ever though, with no specific public roadmap on anything and it's years in the making at this point.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, who also scrape a lot of things from Valve aside from games, like Steamworks Documentation, we've now seen that Valve have <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> their branding guidelines (<a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>), which includes a new bit about SteamOS.<em> These guidelines haven't been updated since 2017.</em></p>
<p>I can show this to you here, since the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/branding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Branding Guidelines</a> page is entirely public, as is the link to the main document from that page. Examples for the new SteamOS Branding Guidlines:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5075490391733323256gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5075490391733323256gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13828148561733323367gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13828148561733323367gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
It will be seriously interesting to see what is the first device other than the Steam Deck to actually ship with SteamOS. Will it be Valve's long rumoured and repeatedly leaked Deckard VR kit, or another handheld from a third-party vendor?</p>
<p>What will be interesting though and a question that popped into my head: what about compatibility notices for games on SteamOS devices other than the Steam Deck? Will that be left to each hardware vendor? I assume so since Valve will still primarily focus on their own Steam Deck with Deck Verified. This may cause community sites like <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> to become more relevant than ever to filter per-device. Don't forget to check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility list</a> too.</p>
<p>Exciting times for the Linux community that we might see more popular devices out there shipping Linux.</p>

      <title>I will admit I had a nerdgasm at the portable pilet mini consoles from soulscircuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the Raspberry Pi 5, the incoming pilet devices from soulscircuit look like a chunky retro-tech enthusiasts wet dream and I want them. I have absolutely <em>zero</em> need of them, but I <em>want</em> them badly. Originally going under the code-name of consolo, I almost let out a little squeal of excitement when seeing them today.</p>
<p>Both versions are modular, that they say are "built by open source software for the open source community" with various schematics and other files freely available. They say the "design will be open-sourced once the product is fully completed" too.</p>
<p>Split across two versions, one is a handheld mini-PC with a keyboard, the other has a bigger screen acting more like a tablet:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20117878771733320731gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20117878771733320731gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Click picture to enlarge. Those with a keen eye may spot a <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bevy Engine</a> folder.</em></p>
<p>They say you'll get dual 8000mah batteries giving you a 7 hour battery life. The tablet sounds like the most fun of the two with you being able to attach a keyboard, gamepad, camera and more. They even showed it off acting like a games console in one picture:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1015251201733320892gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1015251201733320892gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for pricing, that's still to be decided according to their website but they're aiming for around $250.</p>
<p>They have multiple videos of prototype devices in action on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@soulscircuit" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, like the one below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bvV9h5kAPXw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/398cd25408b6cf255a4672572a989e6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bvV9h5kAPXw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Survival game The Long Dark gets a big update with a deep Safehouse Customization system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like it's time to jump back into the world of The Long Dark, with a big update out now that includes major new free features along with expanding their Tales from the Far Territory DLC. This is actually the final update to the Tales from the Far Territory DLC.</p>
<p>For all players there's a new deep Safehouse Customization system. The developers added "over 100" locations in the game that you can turn into a proper safehouse where you can move around furniture and decorative items, get crafting and it includes many new items never seen before in the game. The developers said it's "one of the biggest changes to the game the team has ever accomplished".</p>
<p>By itself that would be a pretty big enhancement to the game but there's plenty more. For the DLC there's a wildlife refresh with new hunting patterns, a refreshed balance of their population numbers, a return of the Cougar and more. There's also a new instant camera, a new trader, new achievements, a new meat curing box and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>It's such a big update they did a 17 minute video on it. See their full video on it below:</p>

      <title>You can win a Steam Deck, Meta Quest 3 VR Headset and more with Fanatical</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fanatical are celebrating their birthday and so they have a new bundle up, which gives you a chance to win some pretty big prizes.</p>
<p>There's a catch though, a <em>big</em> one, it's part of their <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/birthday-mystery-bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Birthday Mystery Bundle</a>. With it you can buy 1-20 random Steam keys, so you don't know what you'll be getting. Which to be blunt — means you're pretty much <em>gambling</em> away money on it.</p>
<p>I decided, for science, to give it a go and ended up with: Dread X Collection, 10 Second Ninja X, Lost Castle, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood and Hue which is actually not a bad key drop at all. I didn't own a single one and the Dread X Collection especially looks fun.</p>
<p>Fanatical say "Every bundle purchased includes a chance to win incredible birthday gifts like a Steam Deck, Meta Quest 3 VR Headset, Lexip Bundle, Twitch Vouchers, or a Fanatical Spending Spree to enjoy on our store. Plus, a few lucky customers will uncover AAA game packs, featuring some of the hottest new releases in gaming!". You also get 5% off your next order if you pick up the bundle.</p>
<p>So at a minimum cost of £1 for 1 Steam key, and a chance to win, perhaps you might want to give it a go. I've seen comments from GamingOnLinux readers when I covered such bundles in the past rather happy with the games they got.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest stable update to the Steam Client for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck today that includes a whole bunch of bug fixes.</p>

<p>Going over the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4472733036435211456" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>, there's <em>nothing</em> that was specific to the Steam Deck in this update. So it's just a generic Steam Client update for all platforms.</p>
<p>What do you want Valve to focus on next? The Family and Game Recording updates are out in the stable client, so what's next for a major addition to Steam? Is it missing something you think should really be there?</p>

      <title>Steam Link gets upgraded for Raspberry Pi 5 and Raspberry Pi Bookworm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve no longer sell their Steam Link hardware, the idea lives on as an app you can install across various devices and recently Valve upgraded the Steam Link app for the Raspberry Pi platform.</p>
<p>The update actually went live on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/4629231777834100224/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">November 12th</a>, and it seems a lot of us missed it, until the official Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/valves-steam-link-on-raspberry-pi/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it went live yesterday to go over the new release. As noted in the RPi blog post from Gordon Hollingworth, getting Steam Link running properly on the Raspberry Pi 5 took a little while since they moved away from closed-source Broadcom multimedia libraries and the move from X11 to Wayland so "a different approach was needed". Sam Lantinga from Valve, who also works on SDL, "has been working with the Raspberry Pi software team to use our hardware in the most efficient way possible".</p>
<p>Now the experience should be pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="19WMSEc9sHc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4f7acb0a81b6a876effed346ee73c2fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/19WMSEc9sHc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From Valve's post on it the Steam Link supports the latest Raspberry Pi Bookworm operating system release in these environments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raspberry Pi 5</p>
<ul>
<li>Console and Desktop environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 at 1080p, 144 FPS</li>
<li>Supports HEVC at 4K, 60 FPS and 1080p, 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Raspberry Pi 4
<ul>
<li>Console and Desktop environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 and HEVC at 1080p, 60 FPS (30 FPS if the display is at 4K resolution)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Raspberry Pi 3
<ul>
<li>Console environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 at 1080p, 60 FPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
<ul>
<li>Console environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 at 1080p, 60 FPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Wired networking is highly recommended for the best streaming experience.</blockquote>
<p>And these changes in the latest Steam Link release for RPi:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added settings recommendations based on network test results.</li>
<li>Fixed the Nintendo Switch Pro controller when connected to the latest Steam client.</li>
<li>Added Indonesian language support.</li>
<li>Fall back to English if non-latin font downloads fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you using Steam Link on a RPi? What's your experience with it? I have an RPi4 sat collecting dust at this point, maybe I should actually blow off the dust and set it up as a Steam Link device. Although, the holidays are coming, perhaps I should treat myself to the RPi5? Decisions…</p>

      <title>Intel announced their Arc B-Series GPUs and XeSS 2, the day after CEO Pat Gelsinger retires</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of a double-whammy this week from Intel. Not only did they announce that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, but they've also now properly revealed their new Arc B-Series GPUs.</p>
<p>News of Gelsinger's retirement was <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-ceo-news-dec-2024.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> by Intel on December 2nd. Intel has named two senior staffers, David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, as interim co-chief executive officers while they search for a new permanent CEO.</p>
<p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.”</p>
<p>As for the new Intel Arc B-Series graphics cards (code-named Battlemage), only two models have been currently announced with the Arc B580 and B570 GPUs. The B580 will get a Limited Edition model and various partner releases from the likes of Acer, ASRock and others starting December 13 from $249. While the B570 will arrive January 16th starting $219.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663127321733255865gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663127321733255865gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Intel said "Compared with the previous generation, the Intel Arc B-Series GPUs offer 70% better performance per Xe-core and 50% more performance per watt. The B580 GPU, when compared to the Intel Arc A750 GPU, is on average 24% faster at 1440p with some games up to 78% faster. When compared to the competition, the Intel Arc B580 GPU offers up to 32% better performance-per-dollar".</p>
<p>This comes along with an announcement of XeSS 2 which now includes three different bits of tech including XeSS Super Resolution, AI-powered XeSS Frame Generation and Xe Low Latency. So they're following in the footsteps of AMD and NVIDIA here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12774276551733255710gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12774276551733255710gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by their press slides games supporting XeSS 2 will including Assassin's Creed Shadows, Harry Potter Quidditch Champions, Robocop Rogue City, Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza, Dying Light 2, F1 24, Ascendant, Marvel Rivals, Killing Floor 3 and Citadels.</p>
<p>See their explainer announcement video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dl81n3ib53Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b7612d4c540158179a7cda917b3e1792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dl81n3ib53Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Be sure to leave a comment on your thoughts. Will you be buying either of the new GPUs?</p>
<p>Hopefully they will work well on Linux. It's likely you'll need a very up to date kernel and Mesa version for them.</p>
<p><em>I'm still not getting Intel press releases, so have reached out again today to see why.</em></p>

      <title>Minecraft Java 1.21.4 &#39;The Garden Awakens&#39; update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have today released Minecraft Java 1.21.4 'The Garden Awakens' update for everyone, bringing with it some fun new toys and a new biome to carefully explore.</p>
<p>In this update you'll find the new Pale Gardens biome which is quite <em>creepy</em>. It's here you'll find the new hostile mob, the Creaking. This strange mob spawns at night in the new biome, and it basically acts like a Weeping Angel from Doctor Who where it won't move if you're looking at it. You'll need to find and destroy a new block, the Creaking Heart, to take it down. Another fun feature of this biome is that ambient sounds come from blocks inside the biome, and any music playing will fade-out when you enter it. Ultra creepy vibes.</p>
<p>There's also numerous new blocks that arrive with it like Pale Oak which comes along with its own Pale Oak Logs that can be crafted into a full woodset including a door, fence, planks, signs and more. There's also the new Eyeblossoms flowers, Pale Moss, Pale Hanging Moss and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0vKS0FOYNok"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8fae765d339f514afde7dd12a9e7dba3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0vKS0FOYNok" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really interesting addition to Minecraft to make exploring the world a bit more exciting. The full changelog can be found on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Minecraft website</a> release page, it's quite long and detailed with lots of smaller changes on top of all the new additions.</p>
<p>You can install and mod Minecraft easily on Linux / Steam Deck with either the <a href="https://modrinth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Modrinth</a> app or the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Prism</a> launcher.</p>

      <title>4X RPG &#39;Heart of the Machine&#39; from Arcen Games (AI War) releases January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcen Games creators of AI War, AI War 2, The Last Federation and other games have announced their new sci-fi 4X RPG Heart of the Machine will launch January 31st, 2025. There's also a new demo available that you can try right now.</p>
<p>More about it: "Heart of the Machine sees players take the role of the world’s first sentient AI, born into a city filled with endless opportunities (and despair). Raise an army of robots to rule by force, become a benevolent machine overlord, or explore a constellation of alternative paths – players must strive to find their place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving (from itself). Whether you rally the underclasses to fight against corporate tyranny, create shell companies and engage in corporate espionage, or just experiment on people to further your goals, the possibilities are endless."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<li>I also created an Async Patched Build for those who prefer using the Async version over the original.</li>
<li>Updated the <code class="inline-code">Logger</code> string in <code class="inline-code">dxvk/src/dxvk/dxvk_instance.cpp</code> and the <code class="inline-code">renderer.drawText</code> string in <code class="inline-code">dxvk/src/dxvk/hud/dxvk_hud_item.cpp</code> to display <strong>"DXVK-Sarek"</strong> instead of <strong>"DXVK"</strong>. This ensures clarity that the build is a custom version and not from the original DXVK repository.
	<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The engine name remains unchanged to preserve compatibility with tools like MangoHUD, which rely on the original <code class="inline-code">DXVK</code> identifier.</li>

      <title>Half-Life 2 co-op mod Synergy upgraded for the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Synergy is a free mod for Half-Life 2 that allows you to play the Half-Life 2 series and many other singleplayer Source Mods cooperatively with friends. It was recently upgraded to support the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/half-life-2-free-to-keep-until-november-18th-episodes-one-two-now-included-with-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first proper update to the mod since 2015, so it's quite a big one. It includes lots of enhancements, including better Steam Deck support! The developers mentioned they've been working on it for a long time, but they released it "sooner than we've planned as to resolve numerous breaking changes from Half-Life 2's recent large update".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19634688841733224478gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all the highlights of what's new and improved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update!</li>
<li>Fixed numerous crashes like the infamous "unconnected" player bug and player models jittering.</li>
<li>Significantly improved overall performance, especially with large player counts.</li>
<li>Rebalanced numerous, rather absurd, map-specific difficulty spikes in the Half-Life 2 campaign.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamVR starting when changing settings.</li>
<li>Initial official native support for Steamdeck (UI still leaves a lot to be desired).</li>
<li>Fixed various HUD issues introduced by Half-Life 2's Steamdeck update.</li>
<li>Official support for Linux Dedicated Servers.
	<ul>
<li>Requires steam client installed (e.g. `sudo apt install steam`).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for saved games.
	<ul>
<li>Host can load a saved game and friends who join will be restored if they were connected at the time of the save.</li>
<li>Works on dedicated servers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various map-specific (EDT) improvements throughout the Half-Life 2 campaigns.</li>
<li>Fixed many level transition issues, particularly on backtracking maps.</li>
<li>Steam Cloud support for settings and saved games.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for dedicated servers.</li>
<li>Steam Rich Presence support.</li>
<li>Enabled spectator mode via console (jointeam 1)</li>
<li>Players will spawn in a vehicle on airboat levels (coast levels TBD).</li>
<li>Vehicles will no longer stop when the game autosaves.</li>
<li>Added more player voice command lines from ep1.</li>
<li>Fixed player viewmodels being invisible under some circumstances.</li>
<li>Optimized networking for some entities like the Airboat.</li>
<li>'Use' key will now go through players to avoid blocking anything.</li>
<li>Removed cheat flag from some useful commands/cvars.</li>
<li>Added game content rating to unblock Synergy in Germany.</li>
<li>Increased maximum player support from 10 to 32.</li>
<li>Other changes lost in time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's next for it? They're working on "automatic networking and Steam friend lobbies" to make it easier to join up with friends without needing port forwarding, which they hope to have "ready in the near future".</p>

      <title>The best Linux distribution for gaming in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a few previous years (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-best-linux-distribution-for-gaming-in-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-best-linux-distros-for-gaming-in-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2</a>), I decided to do a fresh take each time on what the best Linux distribution was for gaming - so I'm back for a 2025 edition of the article that will cause you to tell me how wrong and terrible I am.</p>
<p>What's changed? Well, quite a lot actually. Both previous times I firmly suggested going with plain Ubuntu. However, time moves on, and the software world evolves rather quickly. So I have a new recommendation for you! Why am I even writing this? Sadly, there's <em>still</em> articles out there pushing for tiny completely random fringe distributions and plenty with stupidly outdated and republished information to get to the top of Google.</p>
<p>My current home for a while now, and what I'll recommend you pick up, is <strong><a href="https://kubuntu.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kubuntu</a></strong>. It has all the goodies and support of plain Ubuntu, but with the KDE Plasma desktop environment, which is the same one used on the Steam Deck's Desktop Mode. It has an interface that will be much more familiar to people coming over from Windows, it's more customizable (if you want it) but with a sane default setup that just gets you going quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5826130221733222157gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Kubuntu, Kubuntu 24.04.1, is supported with security and maintenance updates until April 2027. So you can install it and basically forget about it and keep it running and secure for years to come. However, you're likely better off with Kubuntu 24.10 which is more up to date, if you're okay upgrading again when the next version of Kubuntu comes out (Kubuntu 25.04) which is around April 17, 2025. Either way, both work well.</p>
<p>I've been through Fedora, Manjaro, Linux Mint, plain Ubuntu, Arch and many others over the years. No Linux distributions is perfect and they all come with their own set of quirks and problems, just as Windows has its own set of unique issues. To me, Kubuntu just offers the <em>best</em> all around middle-ground of everything you need to get going.</p>
<p>People will argue about Snaps, but for the majority of normal users — it just <em>doesn't</em> matter in the slightest. I use the Spotify, Thunderbird, Telegram and other Snaps and they work <em>great</em> and are kept nicely up to date without me even needing to do anything.</p>
<p>I will suggest though, that you enable Flatpaks from <a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, so you get the best of all worlds and access to even more easily installable packages. It's <a href="https://flathub.org/setup/Kubuntu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">incredibly easy to do</a> as well.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">download Kubuntu from their website</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help and support for Linux and Steam Deck gaming, you can try asking in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forum</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/0rxBtcSOonvGzXr4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>. Don't forget to follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamingonlinux.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> too while you're at it.</p>
<p>Don't agree with me? That's fine! The benefit of Linux is that there's truly no one-size-fits-all. Leave a comment to tell me how wrong I am. <em>You're still wrong if you disagree though.</em></p>

      <title>Prime Gaming December 3rd edition, new titles coming twice this week - lots for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep. This week we get <em>two</em> sets of new games, so there will be another article with the next additions / removals on December 5th too!</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 2024 fundraiser hits the goal - clearly their donation pop-up works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news coming out from camp <a href="https://kde.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KDE</a>, with their yearly fundraiser ongoing and they've managed to smash their original goal.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, KDE developer Carl Schwan <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carl@kde.social/113584216771717051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm so happy to see the big influx of donations to KDE. More than 75 000€ in the last 30 days with 35 000€ in the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is huge. Thank you to everyone who donated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the actual <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">fundraising website</a>, the total is only listed as €34,121 against their original €30,000 goal. But, it seems that's not counting everything. There's also the <a href="https://kde.org/community/donations/previousdonations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">plain donations</a> to keep an eye on too.</p>
<p>There's more details noted in a fresh <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/12/02/i-think-the-donation-notification-works/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Nate Graham that goes over various other details, like how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/kde-plasma-62-adding-a-pop-up-for-donations-plus-they-want-to-make-a-next-generation-kde-os/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new donation request pop-op</a> is clearly working, as it went live on December 1st and this caused donations to <em>surge</em> to where they received "double the prior two months' Paypal donations in a single day".</p>
<p>Thanks to all the donations, KDE e.V. (the non-profit organization that represents the KDE Community), may end up with a balanced budget instead of their predicted "deficit of over €50k in 2024". According to Graham "German nonprofits like KDE e.V. are required to avoid stockpiling money" which is why they run an intentional deficit, so with the funding moving quickly into a positive cashflow they'll end up increasing their expenditure meaning they can hire more people, sponsor more projects and so on.</p>
<p>Really good news, great to see KDE doing well.</p>
<p>Their fundraising website also expanded the list of apps you can "adopt", by donating a specific amount and picking an app you want with a bunch already full but they've recently added more.</p>

      <title>Vulkan API 1.4 released with new required extensions, better 8K rendering</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group have today announced the release of the Vulkan 1.4 API specification, with various changes and improvements for game and application developers.</p>
<p>In the announcement it notes that "Mesa open-source Linux drivers have passed Vulkan 1.4 conformance on AMD, Apple, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm hardware" already. Looking on the conformant <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">driver list</a>, even the Steam Deck is already listed as supporting Vulkan 1.4. On the NVIDIA side, they have a Linux <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.40.81 Vulkan Beta</a> release available with Vulkan 1.4 support.</p>
<p>New features as noted include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/features/latest/features/proposals/VK_VERSION_1_4.html#_streaming_transfers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Streaming Transfers</a>: Vulkan 1.4 imposes new implementation requirements to ensure portable, cross-platform applications can stream large quantities of data to a device while simultaneously rendering at full performance.</li>
<li>Previously optional extensions and features critical to emerging high-performance applications are now mandatory in Vulkan 1.4, ensuring their reliable availability across multiple platforms. These include push descriptors, dynamic rendering local reads, and scalar block layouts.</li>
<li>Maintenance extensions up to and including VK_KHR_maintenance6 are now part of the core Vulkan 1.4 specification.</li>
<li>8K rendering with up to eight separate render targets is now guaranteed to be supported, along with several other limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Vulkan 1.4 is a developer-driven update that enhances Vulkan's value as a stable, reliable framework for creating graphics-intensive applications on any platform,” said Tom Olson, outgoing Vulkan Working Group Chair. “As I step down, I'm proud to see the groundwork we’ve laid through our roadmaps come to fruition. Our roadmap milestone plans have empowered developers with new levels of flexibility and performance, setting Vulkan on a path for continued innovation and broader adoption in the years to come.”</p>
<p>“Vulkan 1.4 is a milestone release that directly brings long-requested features and proven extensions into the core standard. By mandating these capabilities, we are enhancing Vulkan’s flexibility and performance across a wider range of devices, making it easier for developers to create cutting-edge applications with confidence that they will run reliably on any platform," said Ralph Potter, newly elected Vulkan Working Group Chair.</p>

<p>Why? Back in October 2023, Motorsport Games <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/exclusive-simulation-style-nascar-video-game-license-sold-to-iracing/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sold off</a> the NASCAR Team Properties' (NTP) exclusive license to iRacing. So this is just them cleaning up shop.</p>

      <title>Inventory management battler NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters gets new content - we have keys to give away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>In the latest update the developers added in a Swamp Element, a fusion of Nature and Water. They said "This new element brings unique abilities and over 10 fresh upgrades and Cosmions infused with muddy power". Plus various UI and quality of life improvements to make the game better. A Custom PvP battle mode is coming later too. They have it ready, but there's a technical challenge with IP restrictions they're working around right now.</p>

      <title>Looks like Discord finally fixed Linux screen and audio sharing with Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago in November, it seems I missed a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/155794864305471497/803664113560977429/1311064084740964433" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> from a user in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> server, noting that the Discord developers finally hooked up screen and audio sharing for Linux with Wayland.</p>
<p>Not yet <em>released</em> though, it seems it's only currently available in Discord Canary, their public testing environment, but anyone can download it and try it out. On the stable client, it just mentions that "Sounds may not be available when sharing a screen on your device", but when you use the Discord Canary client you'll actually see the tickbox to share audio on Linux now too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12593113211733158763gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Testing it with a couple community members myself using Discord Canary earlier today and — yep, it works perfectly. They could see my shared window and the audio playing from it. Excellent.</p>
<p>Once it's out in the proper <em>stable</em> Discord client, you and friends will be able to sit and chat with screens (or specific windows) and audio being shared properly on Wayland. Nice. I imagine there's many scenarios where this would be useful, and it's a feature many Linux users have been pestering Discord to sort for a while now with a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360050971374-Linux-Screen-Share-Sound-Support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggestion</a> on it open for 4 years.</p>
<p><em>No word on when it will be in the stable release yet though.</em></p>
<p>You can test it via the experimental Canary client from Flathub using these commands (taken from the <a href="https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.DiscordCanary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>):</p>
<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo<br/>
flatpak install flathub-beta com.discordapp.DiscordCanary<br/>
flatpak override --user --socket=wayland com.discordapp.DiscordCanary<br/>
flatpak run com.discordapp.DiscordCanary</code></p>

      <title>Blizzard are delisting Warcraft I and II from GOG, so GOG adds a special discount and will keep them updated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_orcs_and_humans" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warcraft I</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_2_battlenet_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warcraft II</a> are going to be leaving <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> "at the publisher's request" (Blizzard).</p>
<p>They're set to leave GOG on December 13th, although if you have a copy you'll still be able to download it afterwards. If you want to pick them up, GOG have given a special discount code "MakeWarcraftLiveForever" but that only applies to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the bundle</a> of them together. GOG say it will knock "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP or 8 PLN" off the price.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2141467671733155444gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, GOG announced a promise for their recently announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/gog-launch-their-preservation-program-to-make-games-live-forever-with-a-hundred-classics-being-re-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Preservation Program</a> as they said "Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store.". Nice to see for people who do buy it up before it vanishes.</p>
<p>Why are Blizzard doing this now? They recently released Warcraft I: Remastered and Warcraft II: Remastered, although they're only available on Battlenet.</p>

      <title>Linux share remains above 2% in the November 2024 Steam Survey thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for November 2024. Here's the details from it. The good news, for Linux users, is that Linux remains above 2% again overall.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/linux-hits-exactly-2-user-share-on-the-october-2024-steam-survey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a> Valve actually adjusted the numbers at some point in the month for the languages used on Steam and the Linux distribution list, so the previous article and our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> were corrected with the newer numbers. But the overall platform percentage remained the same.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall platform stats for November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.56% -0.05%</li>
<li>Linux 2.03% +0.03%</li>
<li>macOS 1.41%+0.02%</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like things just going back to normal, with the Simplified Chinese language option continuing to drop for three months in a row which always causes a change in the Linux numbers.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">For just Linux here's the most popular distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo (Steam Deck) 64 bit 36.63% -0.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.16% +0.30%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 4.99% +4.99%</li>

      <title>Proton 9.0-4 Beta updated with more game fixes needing testing on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/huge-new-proton-9-0-4-update-for-steam-deck-linux-now-in-need-of-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I covered the huge Proton 9.0-4 update</a> for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux hitting the Release Candidate stage and there's been a couple of changes.</p>
<p>It's not released for everyone yet as you still need to manually opt into the Beta on Proton 9.0 to test. Valve developers are looking for feedback on any issues that you <em>don't</em> see in the current stable Proton 9.0-3.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Since the initial Beta Valve added / changed:</p>

<li>The fix for no audio being played while Microsoft Flight Simulator displays developers logos has been <em>removed</em>. It causes regressions with other games when included without some extra work that's Proton Experimental only for now. The fix is still available via Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Fixed Hell Let Loose crashing when joining a server after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Included a DXVK <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/commit/d96fa54080320e9b63227e76124ffa50a927ced2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regression fix</a> for RaceRoom Racing Experience.</li>

<p>Another month down and we're closing in on the festive period, so here's a look back at what's been popular on Steam Deck during November 2024.</p>
<p>Not really surprising what's number 1 again here!

<p>I'm guilty for adding to Diablo IV even though I own it on Battlenet. The convenience Steam offers is just so much better than other stores and launchers. I forget to ever look at Battlenet, and having it on Steam makes it one-click on both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking to grab a new game, I've listed some really good <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/best-cheap-steam-deck-linux-games-in-the-steam-autumn-sale-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cheap stuff for Steam Deck in the Steam Autumn Sale</a>.

<ul>

Differential updates were implemented with a fallback to full downloads and you should definitely check <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/devblog-237/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Week 237 blog entry</a>, subtitle “Airshipper Partial download”.</li>
<li>Ongoing work on glider courses.</li>
<li>A strong disagreement that started with a discussion about instruments and sounds led to a spiralled misunderstanding, misattribution and hurt feelings between long term developers. It is an unfortunate event, but this conflict lead to the creation of a consensus with multiple statements regarding resolution of such situations. Please read the entire content of these tips at the <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/devblog-235/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Week 235 blog entry</a>, subtitle “Helpful tips and things to know for contributors”.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Airshipper server queries:</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge one that deserved its own topic here since it also features an entire <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/query-serverbrowser-announce/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Player counts is a long-requested feature in the server browser section of Airshipper. Now, the query server allows for clients to query status information about servers more easily displaying accurate ping information, player count, version information and global battlemode. There is a bit of manual work required for server owners to enable that on existing servers, and if you own a Veloren server, please check out the following issue on Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/veloren/serverbrowser/-/issues/103" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">List of servers without a query port</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Project Zomboid set for a massive update that should get a Beta before Christmas</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Zomboid, the highly rated and popular zombie survival game from The Indie Stone, is set to get another truly massive update.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2024/11/whatz-next/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> an unstable Build 42 is planned to arrive before Christmas time, but they will delay it if they need to. However they said "the enjoyment we’re seeing from our testers certainly would seem to suggest that the build will be in a good enough state for wider consumption".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/753386981732884857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Build 42 Unstable is planned to add some great features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An expanded map.</li>
<li>Underground areas.</li>
<li>A new lighting system.</li>
<li>Animal husbandry.</li>
<li>Wild animals.</li>
<li>Expanded lore.</li>
<li>Dynamic music.</li>
<li>Player vocals.</li>
<li>Better UI scaling.</li>
<li>+ much more shown in the image they shared below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Zomboid has now been in Early Access for over 11 years! The Indie Stone have been through some tough times, like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130505000807/https://projectzomboid.com/blog/2011/10/project-zomboid-burglary-statement/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">break-in</a> back in 2011 that resulted in a lot of lost work. Thankfully, the game lived on and became something much-loved by players.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Theme park builder Parkitect gets a campaign editor and a new DLC is on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Survival game The Last Plague: Blight adds controller support, great for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last Plague: Blight <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/uncompromising-wilderness-survival-game-the-last-plague-blight-now-in-early-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impressed me quite a lot</a> with the initial Early Access release, and the developer has been doing some great updates to it recently. </p>
<p>With an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1564600/view/4464851103138186304" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">last week</a> adding in experimental controller support (only for third-person right now) it's supported across Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation controllers. Potentially other controllers as well, but only those controller icons are supported so far. The developer went a step further for Steam Deck, to ensure that text input will give you a proper on-screen keyboard too. Also in is a new radial menu for better controller support, replacing the old quick action menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19244298201732880523gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The third-person mode is also a reasonably new experimental addition to the game, giving it quite a different feel to the default top-down view. Feels almost like it was made for it though after giving it a test run today, it works quite nicely with my Xbox controller on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Since the update landed, a few more have arrived, like giving an on-screen keyboard to controllers other than the Steam Deck, along with various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The Last Plague: Blight now has a Very Positive rating on Steam. With Native Linux support, and hopefully Valve will rate it officially for Steam Deck soon now it has controller support built-in.</p>

      <title>Modding support returns to Dome Keeper in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the developers keep working away on multiplayer for Dome Keeper, you can now get back to filling your game up with mods as support has returned.</p>
<p>The game did have it before, but they did a major upgrade of the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> version used with a previous update, which messed with mod support. Now though, it's back and better than ever with numerous mods upgraded for it.</p>
<p>As they explained in the announcement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year we ported Dome Keeper from Godot 3 to Godot 4. Godot is the engine we use. This was a big undertaking done for three reasons, being multiplayer, console ports and future proofing the project. With that switch, the way the game can be modded did change too, and thus most mods broke.<br/>
We hired Ste from our community to lead the effort of making modding work for Godot 4 for Dome keeper. He is a cornerstone of our community and a key person in the Godot modloader project (shoutout to Kana too &lt;3), so in short the perfect fit to champion modding.</p>
<p>The result: modding is back, yay!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To celebrate, a Dome Keeper modding jam is coming in January and they will be giving out some awards for it.</p>
<p>I recently got quite hooked on Dome Keeper. It's a great game and in the blink of an eye quite a few hours vanished from me. Woops.</p>
<p>Also a great time to mention you can get Dome Keeper and more games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-raw-fury-humble-bundle-is-an-awesome-deal-with-11-steam-deck-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the latest Humble Bundle</a>!</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will get cross-play, a photo mode and 12 subclasses next year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best RPGs ever made is about to get even better, with Larian Studios announcing what looks to be the last major update for Baldur's Gate 3 coming in 2025.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers mentioned we're going to be getting cross-play so you can finally hook up with friends across PC and console. This also includes cross-progression too using the Larian Network.</p>
<p>You might also want to do a fresh play-through as they're also adding in one new subclass for each of the existing Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard classes in the game. This will come with "new abilities, animations, VFX, summons and cantrips, and unique voiced dialogue lines for the Oathbreaker Knight with written reactivity for Oathbreakers, along with a touch of homebrewing on certain actions to enhance your role-playing experience".</p>
<p>I love the idea of the Ranger - Swarmkeeper subclass, giving you three types of deadly swarms to assist you in combat. Or the Barbarian - Path of Giants subclass to give you more power to launch people around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8496320361732878818gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>That sounds pretty exciting actually!</p>
<p>On top of that, there's going to be a proper photo mode to capture those great moments with a whole bunch of options to tweak the camera to your liking. This includes post-processing effects, photo frames, camera angle, what character to focus on, stickers and more.</p>
<p>A stress-test Beta will begin in early January for players to try it out and report any issues.</p>

      <title>Latin cowboy casual farming sim Gaucho and the Grassland new demo released</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>​Gaucho and the Grassland is a game that depicts the life of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucho" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gaúcho</a>, the equivalent of a Latin Cowboy from the region of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampas" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Pampas</a> (South of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile).</p>
<p>The full game is set to be released in Feb 2025, and this is the official trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1ysjZ8aDtn0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6eaa170002d04a13a21c5731f32abcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1ysjZ8aDtn0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Grassland is a place that not only brings you adventures related to daily duties like taking care of the cattle, helping locals, harvesting and resource gathering much like Stardew Valley, but also has some folkloric elements like "Boitatá the fire snake" which corrupts environments as it passes and the "Velho Pai (Old Father)", an Elderly Gaúcho that helps you with general guidance throughout the game.</p>
<p>The demo provided back at the end of 2022 was not that great. Controllers were bad, camera was awkward, mounting the horse was not really enjoyable because the map was tiny, the dog digging items mechanic was awful. However, after playing 3 hours in a chilled exploring mode in the brand new demo, these are my impressions so far:</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Game is more polite with more textures, a better night and day cycle, dynamically moving NPCs, item trading with NPCs, and there is actually an earth curvature while you explore the island.</li>
<li>A significant amount of content was added if compared with the old demo. </li>
<li>There is kind of a tutorial which is gameplay driven that let's you freely explore the map while learning the game mechanics.</li>
<li>I've played in Portuguese and English and I think the linguistic regionalism that is a characteristic of the Pampas is well translated or good equivalents are being used for the written dialogs.</li>
<li>For those born in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Rio Grande do Sul</a> state like me (Gaúcho), there are plenty of cultural references like when you complete a quest and a sample of the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDn3lLEQTD0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Canto Alegretense</a>" song is played, which is culturally relevant and an informal anthem of that state.</li>
<li>Quest system looks fun, and while there is a main quest that bounds all the situations that the NPCs are facing, the side quests help you to understand the mechanics and provide you with new items or recipes. The fact of not having all recipes available and you need to do good deeds to other NPCs to unlock them is cool.</li>
<li>Controllers are really good movement wise and using keyboard + mouse or my 8BitDo as a Steam managed controller worked out of the box except in specific situations (see below).</li>
<li>The Dog mechanic got way better since now the spots where the dog needs to dig are visible, making it easier to spot where you can collect materials instead of relying solely on the game RNG.</li>
<li>The house building and house decoration mechanics are nice and trigger a comfy feeling.</li>
<li>Game has a lot of potential from exploring, collecting, crafting, house building, decoration and puzzle solving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game still needs some optimization. When you start to move around on the map FPS can decrease drastically. In my case with a RTX3070 (laptop) I saw going from 144 to 68, and eventually a dip to 40 FPS.</li>
<li>The game does not have an autosave feature, which is unusual for this kind of exploration game. What happened is that when I was returning some items to end a quest, the NPC was floating(picture below). When I tried to report a bug by pressing F1 the game completely crashed.</li>
<li>When entering build mode to create my first house on the first acquired piece of land, I had to use the mouse to first select the item. After that, I was able to navigate through the building process but it seems that right after you enter build mode, the left thumbstick is useless and the first interaction needs to be done with the mouse. For those using controllers only or movement impaired players with special gamepad setup this could be a problem.</li>
<li>Menus are awkward to navigate with a controller and the game does not  have have a HUD scale setting.</li>
<li>Inventory and crafting uses the same overlay of the main menu, which kinda leads you to the same screen overall if you press Start or Y but on a different tab. On crafting games, I'd expect that you can still observe your environment while crafting and organising your inventory.</li>
<li>Quest tracking only shows one quest per time, and you need to go all over through menus to change the quest you want to track. </li>
<li>Playing on keyboard + mouse is good but the default controller layout needs to be worked a little bit. I’ve got confused many times because LB is “call the dog” and RB is “call the horse” when usually in these games genre it is used for item access on your belt. When I wanted to switch items(which are mapped to Dpad R and Dpad L) I got myself calling my dog or horse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ugly (depends on your opinion)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The expressions used by the main character when doing routine stuff are typically gaúcho regionalisms. While those phrases are catchy for those who understand, may annoy "non south Brazilians" because of the repetition. IMHO, it is stereotypically accurate and non-offensive for those from that region, and I feel like using "Texan accent" audio as a substitution because of the cowboy-ish theme would be bad.</li>
<li>The game received some Rio Grande do Sul state<a href="https://www.procultura.rs.gov.br/ver_projeto_fac.php?cod=4614" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> government subsidy</a> and funding since it portrays the life of the ones who are cowboys in the countryside. This item is on this section because people's opinions can differ much on this matter.</li>
<li>There is no mini-game for fishing which turns it into a boring task if compared with similar game titles. Fishing animation takes a lot of time making it not enjoyable for those who want to grind materials as well, and fells really slow if compared with other gathering mechanics.</li>
<li>While the day and night cycle mechanic is good, the day cycle could be longer proportionately in minutes since during the night most of the NPCs are unreachable.</li>
<li>The previous demo didn’t have a progression system for your actions, and after chopping some wood I noticed that my “Axe Skill” increased by 1, leading to an extra drop rate. After that, the same happened for mining and I don’t know if keeping this progression hidden is by design but, it would be nice to see some progression bars like Valheim.</li>
<li>The Linux demo build is still the one from 2022. I was scratching my head because the old grass bug was still there, and nothing had changed. When I forced the use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for that title, the new demo was provided. I don’t think it is that bad not providing a Native Linux build, but shaders being compiled during the gameplay could be the cause of performance dips although I saw some Brazilian YouTubers playing natively on Windows having those same performance issues.</li>
</ul>

<em>The bug that crashed my game and made me lose 20 minutes of progress</em></p>
<p>The game has incredible potential, if the issues get solved and also because of the fact that you are on an island and navigating out of it could lead to some future DLCs or extra content. I’m giving the benefit of doubt here since other titles of this genre suffered from the same performance issues and got better after some updates.</p>
<p>I tried to be as neutral as possible on my opinions even being a Gaúcho myself.</p>
<p>For those interested, you can<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1670830/Gaucho_and_the_Grassland/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> follow on Steam</a> and download the demo.</p>
<p>Make sure to force the use of the Steam Play <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility tool as highlighted above, as the Native Linux demo is old. I've let the developer know about this. It has Linux in the system requirements, so as far as we know the main release will have Linux support.</p>

      <title>LIGHT OF MOTIRAM takes Horizon Zero Dawn and turns it into a co-op survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is this Palworld all over again? The copying here is pretty blatant. Tencent Games owned developer Polaris Quest revealed LIGHT OF MOTIRAM and it seems very familiar.</p>
<p>Picture this: you run around with a bow and arrow, or a spear, and come across various mechanical beasts that freely roam the world. You've heard that before right? Because that's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West. But actually, it's <em>not</em>, it's LIGHT OF MOTIRAM.</p>
<p>Much like Palworld though, this adds quite a lot to the basic idea. There's online co-op for up to 10 people, 100 different Mechanimals to tame, ride, customize and take into combat with you. A full building system that has "realistic physics" with crafting, making it more of a traditional open-world survival game. Even so, their inspiration is truly obvious. The combat looks a fair bit more like Monster Hunter though, which is interesting. It's just the overall design work is <em>very</em> Horizon looking.</p>
<p>See their first teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hAhp1uJpSDc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdc27407133e388f81182c4f3a70f51e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hAhp1uJpSDc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I must admit, I do love the look and sound of this one.</p>

      <title>We&#39;re getting a Palworld x Terraria crossover, major Palworld update in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a surprise this one. Palworld and Terraria are getting a crossover, but we don't really know what just yet.</p>
<p>When Terraria did this with previous games, both games were updated with some content inspired by the other game. So it's likely each game will add something from the other, which could be quite interesting. Imagine the Eye of Cthulhu from Terraria flying at you in Palworld — and you try to catch it.</p>

<p>2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...</p>
<p>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!</p>

<p>For Palworld, we're also getting the next major update in December as also posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buckycm.bsky.social/post/3lbxrb734ic25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> noting it comes with the new island that's "SIX TIMES BIGGER than Sakurajima will be your greatest challenge yet".</p>

      <title>The new Nexus Mods open source cross-platform app adds Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nexus Mods keep expanding their very promising cross-platform open source app for modding, that will eventually replace their older apps and the new 0.7.0 release just went out.</p>
<p>This expands the game support with Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, on top of the already supported Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. The developers mentioned: "This version adds basic support for Bannerlord. All modules can be easily installed and managed. We've also added several advanced <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/Bannerlord/#loadout-health-check" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Health Check diagnostics</a> to allow players to understand common issues in their setup, with more planned for the future when we add load order support!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6681662731732790238gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em></p>
<p>The Collections download page has been further refined, now giving non-Premium users access to the Collections features.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">An additional experimental update for Cyberpunk 2077 modding support was added with REDmod load order support. They've also added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3: Added <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/BaldursGate3/#loadout-health-check" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">diagnostics</a> relating to BG3 Script Extender.</li>
<li>Updated the My Games page design to better showcase the games you have managed, detected and available in the app but not detected.</li>
<li>Updated the design of tabs in the Workspace system to make them more compact.</li>
<li>General polish to areas of the UI such as Health Check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great stuff. Looking forward to seeing the full release of the Nexus Mods app since it supports Linux and Steam Deck making modding easier for everyone.</p>

      <title>You can get a free copy of both Breathedge and Dark Sector right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of more games and perhaps you can't afford something from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/gogs-black-friday-sale-is-live-now-with-some-big-discounts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG Sale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-autumn-sale-is-live-for-you-to-empty-your-wallets-steam-awards-open-for-nominations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Sale</a> - you're in luck! Here's two free games you can get right now. Both of which are free to keeps!</p>
<p>The first is <strong>Breathedge</strong>, an ironic outer space survival adventure game. Take on the role of a simple guy called the Man who is just carrying his grandpa's ashes to a galactic funeral and suddenly finds himself in the middle of a universal conspiracy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q3TvkZ9vemA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6a3648a67e275a76b3644f9979ee5d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q3TvkZ9vemA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can grab it from <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/breathedge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> for the next two days. However to claim it you need to sign up to their newsletter and link a Steam account. You've got two days to claim it. As a bonus Fanatical will give you 10% off their <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/birthday-mystery-bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Birthday Mystery Bundle</a> until December 19th 2024.</p>
<p>The other one is <strong>Dark Sector</strong>, that thrusts you into the role of Hayden Tenno, a covert operative sent on a dangerous mission into Lasria, an Eastern European city on the brink of ruin that hides a deadly Cold War secret. You end up being affected by some creature, and eventually get some pretty interesting powers.</p>
<p>Made by Digital Extremes, it features many early concepts that would eventually evolve into Warframe</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458214471732788682gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Incredible retro FPS Selaco adds a new &#39;Special Campaign&#39; in another huge update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celebrating six months since the intial Early Access release, the awesome retro-fuelled Selaco has another really big update out now. It's actually kind of ridiculous how much they keep squishing into the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This follows on from a recent Beta, but now it's available to everyone. The major addition is the new Special Campaign mod which is a blend of "New Game Plus and Randomizer Mode" adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A fully customizable campaign experience.</li>
<li>ARPG-style rarity system for both enemies and weapons.</li>
<li>Weapon Trait system where weapons can have new effects and behaviors.</li>
<li>Random Encounter system where new enemies can spawn into the level in real-time.</li>
<li>New unique enemy variants of existing enemies.</li>
<li>Randomization options including shuffled pickup locations, randomized weapon spawns, mystery boxes, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By itself that would be an awesome update but there's a whole lot more to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5787550231732787382gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Altered Orbit Studios also added in support for Steam Cloud, Geforce NOW, smarter tutorial prompts, reworked headshots, improved visuals, improved gun sound effects, more upgrades, improvements to the gore system, melee improvements, enemies will react to getting shot in the legs now, save game protection, new mutators to try and much more.</p>
<p>Due to how big the update is they've moved more story content to sometime in January - February 2025, with Chapter 2 development continuing "rapdily". They gave some teaser info about Chapter 2 including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One of the levels takes place in a mansion.</li>
<li>New defensive items, including a deployable Mini-Turret which comes with its own upgrade tree.</li>
<li>Heavy Weapons. These weapons are extremely powerful, but cannot be stored in your inventory and are thrown away once depleted.</li>
<li>Enemy Miniguns can be picked up.</li>
<li>Drop Pods that can result in unexpected encounters when venturing outside.</li>
<li>Friendly NPC's.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big milestone has been reached by Valve with their handheld Linux gaming PC, with the Steam Deck hitting 17,000 games rated playable or verified.</p>
<p>If you're curious on how long it's taken to hit various milestones Valve hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 in January</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14,000 in March</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-hits-15000-games-rated-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 in May</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-deck-reaches-over-16000-playable-and-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 in August</a>. Filtering specifically just to games on Steam at time of writing there's 5,678 <em>Verified</em>, 11,323 <em>Playable</em> and 4,432 <em>Unsupported</em>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some fun games that recently got <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified include:</p>

<em>Pictured - Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></p>
<p>Some other games are easier to play now too like Marvel’s Midnight Suns, since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/2k-launcher-is-finally-no-more-thats-at-least-one-publisher-making-things-better-for-gamers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2K Launcher is finally no more</a>! We also only just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-fixes-disgaea-4-complete-final-fantasy-xiv-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had another Proton Experimental upgrade</a> to bring more compatibility as well. Plus a stable update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/huge-new-proton-9-0-4-update-for-steam-deck-linux-now-in-need-of-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4 is now in testing</a> too! Things are always moving to get as many games working as possible.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">I've been covering various games that get Steam Deck Verified across different articles so if you want some more highlights here's a few to check back on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-verified-highlights-for-november-7-2024-including-planet-coaster-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified highlights for November 7 2024</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-verified-round-up-your-late-october-2024-highlights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified round-up for late October 2024</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There's a lot of games you can play outside of Steam too, although they do need a little extra setup. Like GOG, Epic Games and more via tools like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>. Remember that Valve's numbers here only include what they've put through testing, and only on Steam — so the overall real number is far higher.</p>
<p>Are you curious to know what games with anti-cheat are playable? I'm currently building up our own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated curated list</a> on that to help you. See more details in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/6277/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my forum post</a> (please leave all comments on that in there).</p>

      <title>Steam Autumn Sale is live for you to empty your wallets, Steam Awards open for nominations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another year coming to a close and so the Steam Autumn Sale is live again until December 4. Time to find where your wallet is hiding.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you <em>have</em> to buy anything though. Like me, many of you probably have a few hundred games gathering dust, waiting for that rainy day where you keep promising you'll play with them right? But, a few more couldn't hurt. <em>Some of the deals sure do look delicious.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JC876LwJ2AQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a85fd94f4c2347de237d5561a93eb13f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JC876LwJ2AQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So many thousands of great games on sale, you really don't need any reccomendations from me do you? Oh, you do? Well here's a few favourites going cheaper that work on Steam Deck / Linux Desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222140/Detroit_Become_Human" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Detroit: Become Human</a> - 70% off</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valheim </a>- 50% off</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve also put up the 64GB (EU 15% off) and 512GB (US/Canada 25% off) Steam Deck models on sale, in regions where they still have stock. These are the models that have been discontinued.</p>
<p>This is a great time to give over some suggestions to your fellow GamingOnLinux readers. Drop a comment of your top 5 games on sale you think people should be picking up.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>.</p>
<p>You can also now nominate your favourite games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/nominations" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Steam Awards</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going to wait a bit, the Steam Winter Sale will start December 19th. So even if you miss something in this sale it won't be long for the next major sale.</p>

      <title>New Steam Controller 2 and VR controller designs got leaked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve did a bit of a woops here, as they recently accidentally leaked the designs for what looks like their upcoming Steam Controller 2 and a new VR controller that is likely to come with the long leaked Deckard VR headset.</p>
<p>This is all speculation as always from leaks, as what we've seen might not even get released. As we saw from the Steam Deck, Valve go through a lot of iterations on their hardware before release.</p>
<p>Spotted by SteamDB developer Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbv5dzg5fc2o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the newer Steam Controller 2 looks like everything I wanted. Here's a slightly upscaled version of what they found for what's code-named Ibex.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7591896621732710513gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Looks rather nice, and I'm really happy to see dual thumbsticks and thumbpads, much more like the Steam Deck. Clearly Valve have taken notes about how much people love the inputs on the Steam Deck. My only concern there is how thick it looks, so it will be very interesting to eventually get my hands on it to see how it feels.</p>
<p>According to Djundik on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbv5gkx2qk2l" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, here's how the leak happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way it leaked is funny, [they] put "freetodownload" on the SteamVR app for anonymous accounts to access, which made all the depots accessible, and one of the depots was the contents for deckard/roy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Will you buy one?</p>

      <title>Huge new Proton 9.0-4 update for Steam Deck / Linux now in need of testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to bring improved compatibility with Windows games to Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, Valve has a Proton 9.0-4 Release Candidate in need of testing. Confused on Proton? Check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>This pulls in a lot of improvements from recent updates to Proton Experimental, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-fixes-disgaea-4-complete-final-fantasy-xiv-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve constantly update</a> or Proton Hotfix for specific games. It's subject to change though as the list is only tentative, as Valve may add or remove some notes based on any issues found.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Valve list these as newly playable:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For giving feedback, Valve ask to report issues that are new to this specific 9.0-4 Release Candidate that you <em>don't</em> see in Proton 9.0-3.</p>
<p>How to access it? Find Proton 9 in your Steam Library, go into the Properties -&gt; Betas and select "release-candidate". Then let it update and away you go.</p>

      <title>TRX an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 keeps expanding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally two separate projects, the open source reimplementations of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 now live under one roof with the TRX project. They're still having distinct individual releases though.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 1 is fully playable, with Tomb Raider 2 in progress and not ready yet. Tomb Raider 1 is supported across Linux, macOS and Windows but Tomb Raider 2 only for Windows right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9304304261732630857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/tomb-raider-1-open-source-engine-tr1x-adds-a-60fps-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last writing about the project</a> there's been some pretty big updates adding in the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to pause during cutscenes.</li>
<li>A photo mode.</li>
<li>An option to toggle the in-game UI.</li>
<li>An option to use PS1 tinted savegame crystals</li>
<li>Added skybox support, with a default option provided for Lost Valley, Colosseum and Obelisk of Khamoon.</li>
<li>Tons of bug fixes.</li>
<li>Various performance and loading time improvements.</li>
<li>Improved custom level support.</li>
<li>Updated OpenGL backend to use version 3.3, with fallback to 2.1 if initialization fails.</li>
<li>Optional automatic key/puzzle inventory item pre-selection.</li>
<li>Ability to disable saves completely by setting the save slot to 0.</li>
<li>+ much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just for Tomb Raider 1, there's been a lot of ongoing work to get Tomb Raider 2 properly playable too.</p>
<p>While the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection does exist, this project works with the originals and enhances them. You can grab them from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess hits a big milestone with over 500,000 copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the big free The Pristine Cut upgrade, Slay the Princess from Black Tabby Games continues to do really well.</p>
<p>Probably one of the best modern visual novels around with its mixture of great writing and lovely artwork. You can read some thoughts from a contributor on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/slay-the-princess-review-as-pristine-as-the-blade-cuts-deep/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pristine Cut in a previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1989270/view/4489620901087674399" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned: "We're beyond thrilled to announce that Slay the Princess has sold over 500,000 copies globally across PC, Mac, Linux, and consoles! It's been one of the greatest experiences of our lives watching so many of you connect with this passion project, and every step of the way you've helped our work exceed even our wildest expectations."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17615634991732628531gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fully voice-acted by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
<li>Hand-penciled art - every background and sprite is drawn traditionally with pencil and paper by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</li>
<li>A princess. She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li>No, the Princess isn't a “cosmic horror,” whatever that is supposed to mean. She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li>Don't even think about trying to romance her. It won't end well for you.</li>
<li>Hopefully you won't die. But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>A branching narrative where what you say and what you believe determines both who you are and how the story unfolds. Though I wouldn’t recommend taking any paths outside of the one I lay before you.</li>
<li>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of Scarlet Hollow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great to see games of all kinds managing to actually sell. In the announcement the developer also mentioned their other game, Scarlet Hollow, will get an update for the first four episodes early next year and then episode five will release later in 2025.</p>

      <title>Dev of Proton Sarek for older GPUs has forked DXVK to backport game settings and improve compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of the interesting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/check-out-proton-sarek-if-you-have-an-older-gpu-for-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Sarek</a> project to help Linux gamers with older GPUs play more games has now <a href="https://github.com/pythonlover02/DXVK-Sarek" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forked DXVK</a>, to hopefully improve things even further.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This repository was created to support users with Vulkan capable GPUs that do not meet the 1.3 requirement of the current builds. My goal is to ensure that everyone can benefit from the nice performance of DXVK, even if their hardware is slightly older.</p>
<p>Additionally, this project is intended to be integrated into <a href="https://github.com/pythonlover02/Proton-Sarek" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton Sarek</a>. The main idea is to backport Quality of Life (QOL) patches and per game configurations from the latest versions to the 1.10.x branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email, the developer told me "I've already backported and updated around 40 per game configurations, and a release should be available soon, around the start to mid December. This release will support both a standard DXVK and an Async version, with both integrated under Proton-Sarek."</p>
<p>Nice to see. While Valve continue pushing their official Proton forward, it often needs the most up to date drivers and the latest Vulkan support. So those of you with older GPUs can still benefit from getting a better experience and not being left behind thanks to Proton Sarek.</p>

      <title>Action-platformer metroidvania Janosik 2 will be a &#39;bigger, bolder adventure&#39; launching December 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free to play Janosik just got a major update, and its bigger, bolder adventure sequel Janosik 2 is set for launch on December 9. The first game is quite popular with a Very Positive rating on Steam, and this sequel looks like it expands on everything from the first.</p>
<p>If you've not played the original, now is a great time, as they've updated the free game with 4 new outfits for Janosik that you can unlock by completing 4 entirely new dungeons.</p>
<p>As for Janosik 2 the developers mentioned it's a "bigger, bolder adventure you don’t want to miss" with four unique playable characters. It takes off directly after the events of the original too. As they said: "Tricked by an ingenious ruse, Janosik must find a way to escape captivity and take the fight directly to Countess Bathory, who thinks she is pulling all the strings in the Highlands. Joined by Bogdan the Werewolf and Hugo the Vampire, and Janka the Plucky Maiden traverse through massive levels filled with mythical foes, deadly traps, and pesky De Blonde's goons."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U46gYJYd9HQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c7751a46e02e31349b78386fb53d45a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U46gYJYd9HQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They both have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fun one with Janosik 2 having multiple endings, various cut-scenes, four playable characters, various new enemies and environmental threats and new traversal options.</p>

      <title>PlaytronOS Alpha 2 brings expanded NVIDIA support, more handheld PC support and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playtron continue building up their PlaytronOS / GameOS (they don't seem to have settled properly on a name yet) alternative to SteamOS and Windows with a second Alpha release out now.</p>
<p>If you're just joining us and have no idea what PlaytronOS actually is. It's a Linux-powered distribution (specifically it's based on the Fedora Silverblue family of Atomic Desktop distros) that aims to play games from Steam, Epic Games, GOG and other platforms out of the box with a sleek interface and everything built-in so you don't need any external launchers. A good idea for handhelds, and they will support desktops and other devices too.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Hardware Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA support for Turing (GeForce GTX 1600/2000 series) and newer cards</li>
<li>Support for dual-GPU systems such as desktops and laptops</li>
<li>OS upgrade from Fedora 40 to Fedora 41</li>
<li>Support for portal-based Wi-Fi connections</li>
<li>These devices have been tested by Playtron and are known to work:
	<ul>
<li>AYANEO 2 and 2S</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally</li>
<li>Lenovo Legion Go</li>
<li>Valve Steam Deck LCD (NVMe only)</li>
<li>Valve Steam Deck OLED</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New &amp; Updated Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full cloud save support with conflict resolution for Epic Games Store and GOG.com games</li>
<li>App details page with game metadata and actions</li>
<li>Full support for mouse and keyboard input</li>
<li>New sound effects</li>
<li>Basic avatar system</li>
<li>Select custom game input configurations some text
	<ul>
<li>A limited selection of inputs are provided by the Playtron team as part of the Alpha 2 launch</li>
<li>Input configuration creation will be one of the features of our upcoming tool Playtron Labs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Timezone support</li>
<li>Up to 2x battery usage improvement in OS</li>
<li>Over 100 bugs identified and fixed</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm keen to see where they go with it, but they need to settle on a name properly and stop flip-flopping between PlaytronOS and GameOS whenever they talk about it. That, and their earlier marketing was quite silly, but they do seem to have cleaned up their website quite a lot. My other concern is how locked down they will keep it, as per their FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first, only the operating system code will be open source. We have plans to open source more and release API documentation to allow developers in the community to contribute and build their solutions using Playtron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's Linux, it will have all the same anti-cheat problems that SteamOS has on Steam Deck too. They still say they're "working with interested partners to enable anti-cheat services" but until they have a proper release with more hardware, I don't see anything changing there. Valve have sold multiple millions of Steam Decks now, and we still see companies newly blocking it like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>. <em>You can keep up to date on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our new anti-cheat page</a> (more info in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/6277/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my forum post</a>).</em></p>
<p>The only device that has been announced with it so far is still the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weird SuiPlay0X1</a>, a $599 handheld from a web3 / blockchain company that talks about NFTs and crypto.</p>
<p>You can download Alpha 2 from <a href="https://www.playtron.one/playtron-os" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>2K Launcher is finally no more - that&#39;s at least one publisher making things better for gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K Games have officially nuked the 2K Launcher from orbit, finally removing it from their games across both Steam and Epic. One publisher at least making things smoother for us all, and even better on Steam Deck since these extra launchers tend to be quite a nuisance.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated post</a> on their official support page they noted that "As of November 18, 2024, the 2K Launcher has been removed from every game that used it on". Yesterday, November 25, a "follow-up update was sent out via Steam to make sure the 2K Launcher was fully removed".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">These games now just launch completely direct into the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bioshock Remastered</li>
<li>Bioshock 2 Remastered</li>
<li>Bioshock Infinite</li>
<li>The Quarry</li>
<li>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">However, these below have a few different launch options, but these are direct Steam launch options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Civilization VI</li>
<li>Civilization V</li>
<li>XCOM 2</li>
<li>XCOM: Chimera Squad</li>
</ul>
<p>2K noted the new XCOM 2 Mod Launcher has also been tested working on Steam Deck, but certain buttons don't work with the gamepad controls so you'll need to adjust Steam Input for it. XCOM: Chimera Squad also has a Mod Launcher, which they said has the same issue but additionally on Steam Deck the Play and Manage Mods buttons have some graphical issues but still function.</p>
<p>You may need to completely close and re-open Steam to see the new launch options for each game.</p>
<p><em>What a lovely thing to wake up to.</em></p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core teaser trailer has me excited for more rock and stone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic is a truly <em>excellent</em> online co-op game, one of the best in fact. Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core takes all the cool bits of it and turns it into a rogue-lite.</p>
<p>To step back a hot second: Deep Rock Galactic has you and a few friends pick a <em>specific</em> type of mission, gear up and then jump into a pod that drills into the planet Hoxxes IV with fully destructible environments, and lots of aliens to squash. Your character gets upgraded outside each mission, to get access to various different tools and weaponry. So you go in fully equipped for the mission you've selected with your chosen character class.</p>
<p>With Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core instead of that defined mission structure and fully equipped space dwarves, it's a lot more random, and more fast-paced. You and your friends start missions with basically nothing, and upgrade as you go through the run gaining new equipment and abilities, making a new character build each time you go through. Plus some meta-progression on top of that.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VXnK8YrWdA0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d06870b35ae0bbb47ae65db97f5e767.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VXnK8YrWdA0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like some fun lore behind it too. in Rogue Core, you're an elite Reclaimer, the ones sent in when the miners can't handle the job as you fight through facilities that were previously set up by the Deep Rock Galactic company.</p>
<p>Many have asked and wondered why this isn't an expansion to DRG, and the developers answered in a detailed post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2605790/view/4482865501645572470" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It started out as an expansion. But as we got deeper into working on it, we found that we wanted to do a lot of stuff that felt way beyond the theme and feel of DRG. In other words, we felt more creative and excited when we didn’t have to keep making sure every idea for Rogue Core fit with the DRG legacy. Another big factor was Early Access – that’s a big way for us to get community feedback and fine-tune everything, and you can’t do that with DLC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt it will play well on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Perhaps even Steam Deck too if the requirements are close enough to the original Deep Rock Galactic. The game is a while away though, not likely until Q4 2025.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental for Steam Deck / Linux fixes Disgaea 4 Complete+, Final Fantasy XIV and various other games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated Proton Experimental, the testing-ground for new features and fixes for their Windows compatibility layer for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Here's what's new for November 25th.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as now playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disgaea 4 Complete+</li>
<li>Soul Interface</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some regressions introduced in previous Proton Experimental updates were solved including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall Guys is playable again.</li>
<li>It's possible to interact with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout: New Vegas launchers using mouse.</li>
<li>Videos play correctly again in Resident Evil 7 Biohazard and Resident Evil Village.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Regressions since Proton 9.0 solved:</p>

<em>Pictured - Final Fantasy XIV</em></p>
<p>From the changelog on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have Proton Experimental downloaded, it will show up in your Steam Downloads as needing an update. Otherwise, you can just search for it in your Steam Library to install it. Learn more in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A quick note as well: recently I noticed <em>various</em> other news websites suddenly covering the NVIDIA DLSS 3 update in Proton Experimental that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-adds-dlss-3-frame-generation-support-plus-fixes-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-rivals-of-aether-ii-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I covered nearly two weeks ago</a>. One generic PC site covered it, then another and then another…and so on, sourcing each other. Many making claims of a Steam Deck 2 in some form.</p>
<p>Some writers seem to be mixing up (either for clickbait or they're just confused), that Proton is somehow tied to SteamOS or the Steam Deck, but remember - we all use it on Desktop Linux too. Not everything is directly Steam Deck related at all. Plus, you can bet the Steam Deck 2 <em>if</em> it ever releases <em>will</em> continue to be using an AMD APU. I'll eat my current Steam Deck if Valve went with Intel or NVIDIA. <em>Don't hold me to that.</em></p>

      <title>Unrailed 2: Back on Track gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for track building on the go, Unrailed 2: Back on Track is now Steam Deck Verified even though it's not finished yet. It only released into Early Access on November 7th, and they plan around 1 year until it's done.</p>
<p>More about it: "Unrailed 2: Back on Track brings chaotic local and online multiplayer track-building action to the next level – band together with friends to collaborate and build your track across new procedurally generated worlds - WHILST the train is running! So think fast, with more freedom than ever before, and conquer new obstacles in your way - before your trains becomes… a trainwreck!"</p>
<p>Valve Verified it against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-3</a>. So you're thoroughly good to go on Desktop Linux too with that version. The developers of the game shared the news in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2211170/announcements/detail/4481739601737679116" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam post today</a>.</p>

<p>Since the initial release, the developers have been quick to put up improvements across multiple patches. I'm looking forward to it as a big fan of the first game, but I'm going to personally wait until it's had a little more time in the oven to add content.</p>

      <title>Linux Firmware Updater adds initial community support for ASUS ROG Ally and ROG Ally X</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>fwupd is a great tool to update firmware easily on Linux and version 2.0.2 was just released, bringing new features and support for more devices. By default, it pulls from the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (<a href="https://fwupd.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LVFS</a>), where hardware vendors can officially put up their firmware. Hopefully more hardware vendors will use it over time, quite a few already do.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On top of bug fixes and a few new features <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/releases/tag/2.0.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">version 2.0.2</a> is out now bringing support for these devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally and ROG Ally X (initial support, community provided).</li>
<li>Google GID8 headset.</li>
<li>j5create USB-C JCD373.</li>
<li>Logitech Sight (as standalone device).</li>
<li>MNT Pocket Reform.</li>
<li>Netprisma LCUR57 and FCUN69.</li>
<li>Parade PS188.</li>
<li>Quectel DFOTA devices.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Pico.</li>
<li>SteelSeries Nova 5.</li>
<li>Telink DFU-HID devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see some handheld gaming PCs get some support in there. Although it would be great if ASUS put it up directly. If you're interested in the ROG Ally support, it's from <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/pull/7782" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this linked pull request</a>.</p>
<p>In related news <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/valve-fixes-up-steam-input-bug-with-rog-ally-x/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve recently fixed up</a> a Steam Input bug with the ROG Ally X, plus at the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/bazzite-updated-to-fedora-41-with-expanded-pc-gaming-handheld-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">end of October the latest Bazzite release</a> also improved Linux support on the ROG Ally series.</p>

      <title>Star Fox 64 is getting a Native PC port from the devs of Ocarina Of Time and Zelda Majoras Mask ports</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Harbour Masters community of developers who are behind the PC ports of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ocarina Of Time </a>and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/2-ship-2-harkinian-another-unofficial-pc-port-of-zelda-majoras-mask-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zelda Majoras Mask</a> have revealed a Star Fox 64 Native PC port is coming.</p>
<p>Announced via their Discord, they made it clear there's no time-frame on when it will release as it's still in development. However, they've "gotten the game to a state where we feel comfortable showcasing it for you" and so they pulled in a community streamer to show it off that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WjGSFdQcNEs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/576ff94a9ca07de2fa480d6ba0a5fe03.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WjGSFdQcNEs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While you could play it via an emulator already, the Native PC ports do come with a lot of enhancements. Plus they're a building off point for people to do other fun mods with as well. It's also just great for continued game preservation.</p>
<p>Since the two previous projects have Native Linux support, it's likely this will too whenever they put it live on GitHub.</p>

      <title>Death has a cute little pig companion in action-adventure Spindle - check out the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spindle looks quite sweet, and one I haven't heard anything about for a while after its successful crowdfunding campaign <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/in-spindle-you-become-death-and-figure-out-why-no-one-is-dying-along-with-your-pet-pig/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2021</a>. But there's a new trailer to show it off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is it? An old-school action-adventure where you step into the role of Death. But you're not alone on your journey through this strange, chaotic world – your trusty sidekick, an ever-loyal pig, will be with you every step of the way. The story sounds interesting too. A world where nobody dies anymore resulting in some strange happenings and you have to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L3DFO8V5gH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/603610500b048429bb9c5d8b0a4e1d69.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L3DFO8V5gH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>ScummVM 2.9.0 for retro gaming is approaching and in need of testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ScummVM project is readying up another release, with the developers issuing a call for testing on ScummVM 2.9.0.</p>
<p>If you're just joining us and don't know what ScummVM does? ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. It replaces the original executable to launch the game, to get them running on modern systems with various enhancements. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20241123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they noted these newly supported games in particular need testing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Orion Burger.</li>
<li>Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.</li>
<li>Thimbleweed Park.</li>
<li>The Space Bar.</li>
<li>Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)</li>
<li>Backyard Basketball.</li>
<li>Unrest.</li>
<li>Rise of the Dragon.</li>
<li>Castle Master.</li>
<li>Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)</li>
<li>Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)</li>
<li>Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)</li>
<li>The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)</li>
<li>Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of newly supported games being added, they also said "almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes" so testing various other games will be helpful too.</p>
<p>The actual <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/branch-2-9/NEWS.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> of what's new and improved is a long as always.</p>

      <title>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault open source remake gets a first Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day has arrived! Medal of Honor: Allied Assault including the Spearhead and Breakthrough expansions can be played easily on modern systems, with various enhancements thanks to the OpenMoHAA project.</p>
<p>Just announced in the last day is version v0.80.0-beta, where they said "As all of the features from the original game are implemented and the stability increased, the project is transitioning from alpha to beta." — so it may be finally time to jump in.</p>
<p>More: "The main goal of OpenMoHAA is to ensure the future and continuity of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on all platforms/architectures by providing new patches/features. Thanks to the ioquake3 project and the F.A.K.K SDK, OpenMoHAA has already reached more than half of its goal: an open-source version of MoH:AA (based on version 2.40) that is fully compatible with the original game (in terms of protocol, assets, and scripts)."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17267905441732523410gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17267905441732523410gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMoHAA on Linux, taken today</em></p>
<p>There's a fair amount of enhancements to the game like full 64-bit support, an SDL2 backend, OpenAL sound support, cross-platform support, lots of bug fixes, demo recording, smoother animations, bots for servers, IP bans for servers and so on.</p>
<p>For anyone who did try it previously, the highlights of new stuff to the Beta include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 3 launchers for simplicity, to start Allied Assault, Spearhead or Breakthrough</li>
<li>Rendering
	<ul>
<li>Better lighting</li>
<li>Decals / level marks are now rendered</li>
<li>Dynamic lights are now renderered properly, no more ground blinking issues when shooting rockets</li>
<li>Entities are now lit better by sphere lights (some artifacts are still present)</li>
<li>Sunflares are now rendered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI fixes (animations, logic, seeing through windows, holding turrets, speech animation...)</li>
<li>Animation fixes + smoother animations</li>
<li>Audio system enhancement</li>
<li>Better FX</li>
<li>Briefing videos from Spearhead and Breakthrough and game intro are working</li>
<li>Crashes fix</li>
<li>Demos are now supported using <code class="inline-code">+set com_target_demo 1</code> launch command-line</li>
<li>Fixed mods not loading properly</li>
<li>Fixed weird movement artifacts when running server on ARM</li>
<li>Less crashes</li>
<li>Network profiling</li>
<li>Script engine fixes + better mod support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy the original game for the data files it needs from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>See more on the project <a href="https://github.com/openmoh/openmohaa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Running it on Linux was quite easy. I used the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a> to download the game from <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, then dropped the release files from the OpenMoHAA into the installed folder and launched it.</p>

      <title>UnderworldGodot is an engine recreation of Ultima Underworld 1 &amp; 2 in Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking over from the original Unity-based project, UnderworldGodot is an engine recreation of Ultima Underworld and Ultima Underworld 2 in the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Great for preservation of some classics.</p>
<p>Writing on the now archived GitHub of the <a href="https://github.com/hankmorgan/UnderworldExporter" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">original</a> Unity version, the developer noted the move to Godot was to "ensure the engine and software is more fully open source as well as avoiding risks due to Unity licencing changes". The project is a reboot and aims to "act more like the Underworld games originally worked".</p>
<p>Setting some expectations, the developer notes it's to be considered "pre-alpha" with no support, so don't expect it to be playable yet. It does have a long list of features already implemented, but there's also a lot still missing in it.</p>

      <title>JSAUX released their first White 6-in-1 Docking Station for handhelds like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX have released another Docking Station, this time it's White and it does look rather nice. A good match for the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-white-and-steam-deck-australia-have-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White launch</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/the-new-detachable-jsaux-dock-will-fit-a-steam-deck-rog-ally-x-legion-go-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one I previously covered</a>, just with the colour change to match. I must admit though, I really do love it in White. For people worried it will yellow over time, like a lot of White tech, JSAUX said: "If you’re old enough, you might recall that white hardware often turns yellow over time. To ensure our white Docking Stations stay white throughout their use, we carefully selected high-quality raw materials. Thanks to these materials and advanced anti-aging techniques, we’ve achieved a durable, lasting white finish that perfectly matches your white Steam Deck."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13026297781732520664gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1* USB-C port for connecting to the handheld device.<br/>
1* USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).<br/>
2* USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).<br/>
1* Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps).<br/>
1* HDMI (4K@120Hz).<br/>
1* USB-C (PD 100W input).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's usually $45.99, but they have a sale on right now so it's $42.99 until December 5th. Pretty great price really for what you get. And the dock itself can be pulled out from the stand too so you can use it easily with other devices that don't need a stand.</p>
<p>JSAUX say it will fit properly and work with the ROG Ally X, ROG Ally, Steam Deck, and Legion Go.</p>

      <title>Wine 9.22 released noting the &#39;Wayland driver enabled in default configuration&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Closing in on the Wine 10 stable release now! Wine 9.22 has been released, ahead of the first release candidate for Wine 10 in two weeks time. The Wine 10 release itself is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/windows-to-linux-compatibility-layer-wine-10-0-planned-for-mid-january-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">due for sometime around mid-January</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.22" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> the highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for display mode virtualization.</li>
<li>Locale data updated to Unicode CLDR 46.</li>
<li>More support for network sessions in DirectPlay.</li>
<li>Wayland driver enabled in default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5583" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, it seems Wayland is only currently used when x11 fails. So it's enabled, but not the default go-to, likely as more Wayland work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>There's also bug fixes noted for Dark Souls Remastered, World Of Warcraft and Steam. Plus a few other miscellaneous behaviour fixes.</p>

      <title>War Thunder adds stealth tech, ray tracing and graphics upgrades in the Firebirds update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every time a new War Thunder update comes out, I think to myself: I'm finally going to progress a bit more into the aircraft research and then get side-tracked by tanks. But now, with stealth added in the Firebirds update, I might just have to sink some more hours in.</p>
<p>An exciting addition is the F-117A (Squadron Vehicle) which brings in a brand new stealth capability to the game. The developers note this craft has a "lower IR and radio signature". There's also multiple other aircraft including the F-15E, Su-34, Tornado GR.4 and Mirage 2000 RMV. There's also multiple new helicopters and new tanks.</p>
<p>But there's a lot more to this update as they've added in AMD FSR 3.1, DLAA, XeSS, TSR, Direct3D 12 (beta) and Ray Tracing (beta) with an overhaul to the graphics settings menu. They say they're looking at adding frame generation for a future update too. There's also some small reworks to multiple locations, but the "Abandoned Factory" got a huge upgrade visually and looks awesome. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z7_LWZxyhdY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e334888f3a100ccc516be905aecdd337.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z7_LWZxyhdY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has Native Linux support with Vulkan, it looks like AMD FSR, XeSS and Ray Tracing are all currently only available via DirectX 12 - so you'll need to run War Thunder with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to see any of that. <em>I'm hoping they continue to work on their Vulkan renderer too.</em></p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Truckful, a driving adventure mystery game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful was revealed back in July, and the idea of it had me really intrigued and now they have a new trailer up for this driving action-adventure mystery game. It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>What seems like initially a peaceful but challenging game about trucking and delivering packages, where you upgrade your vehicle as you go, and have to learn how to handle some tricky roads with all sorts of packages seems to soon turn into something a bit weirder. As they said when it was announced: </p>
<p>"This seemingly idyllic countryside hides its fair share of mysteries, though. The ancient forest on the outskirts whispers through local legends and folklore, its dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadows… Explore hidden paths, navigate misty wetlands, and brave treacherous marshes and quicksands to uncover the truth beneath the branches."</p>
<p>Anyway, announced during The MIX Fall Showcase 2024 was a new trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sS3hpCthbqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f1beb824aab9502bc742aeaa0b54a86d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sS3hpCthbqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive, upgrade and customize your pickup truck</li>
<li>Pack the truck bed with cargo of all shapes and sizes</li>
<li>Complete errands for villagers in need</li>
<li>Enjoy a physics-based car handling gameplay</li>
<li>Unravel the mystery of the old forest</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free-to-play pixel art survival game Ruins To Fortress arrives December 13</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruins To Fortress looks like it could be interesting, a post-apocalyptic free-to-play pixel art open survival game. The developers have announced it's going to enter Early Access on December 13th.</p>
<p>Like a sort of blending somewhere between Terraria and Starbound, set on a single island where you craft tools, grow food, build formidable defences, and raze enemy bases. Here though you can either cooperate, or go after rivals so it's more on the competitive side. So perhaps a bit more like a side-scrolling Rust as you'll be able to host your own servers too.</p>
<p>They also have a new trailer to show it off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WH9SqPen_bY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e1a2014cbd212f49d0e3546bba33a15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WH9SqPen_bY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it will be free they will be offering a single DLC to support the game that will include what sounds like mostly cosmetic items.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included gets a Free Weekend, big update live and new DLC coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is one of my favourites from Klei Entertainment, a space-colony simulation game that's Steam Deck Verified and has full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>If you still haven't tried it out, there's good news. A Free Weekend for it is live on Steam so you can try it completely free all weekend, and it has a big 66% discount on it too.</p>
<p>A new DLC was also revealed with Oxygen Not Included: The Bionic Booster Pack that "revolutionizes the workforce with new bionic Duplicants, skill-enhancing bionic booster modules, portable power storage, and remote-work buildings—everything you need to create a colony of cosmic proportions".</p>
<p>These bionic Duplicants sound really useful, since they can work in low-breathability environments thanks to having their own little oxygen supply. A lot more to it like portable power banks for your bionic buddies, rockets that can be pilot-less, remote-work buildings and new cosmetic items. No release date for it yet though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20774611031732273143gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the free update for all players it's quite a big one too. It includes new buildings for everyone, upgrades to the schedule system, various UI improvements and lots of bug fixes across the base game and other DLC.</p>
