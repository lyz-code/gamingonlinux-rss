      <title>EmuDeck 2.3 out now with a fresh UI design, 3DS emulators return</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/emudeck-23-beta-brings-a-new-unified-ui-and-multi-language-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta period I covered previously</a>, the EmuDeck team have released EmuDeck 2.3 that comes with the big user interface overhaul. Not only that but Nintendo 3DS emulators have made a return.</p>
<p>Hold up, what's EmuDeck again? It's a system to make emulation easy across Steam Deck / SteamOS, desktop Linux, Windows and Android. It sets everything up for you and with this release, it should be easier than ever to use thanks to the fancy new interface.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main <a href="https://emudeck.github.io/blog/2026/09/25/emudeck-update-09-26-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> as noted in v2.3 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New unified UI.</li>
<li>Button to remove SRM entries in manage emulators.</li>
<li>Partial Multilanguage support.</li>
<li>Auto setup emulators on your device's language.</li>
<li>Lime3DS, a Citra fork has been added.</li>
<li>Citra is back! We've added PabloMK7 Citra's fork.</li>
<li>EmuDecky - Now you can update emulators from gaming mode (install from EmuDeck, not the Decky Store).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how the new UI looks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17791339761727363931gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17791339761727363931gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power major expansion released, plus a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power along with the free 1.13.0 "Basileus" update have launched, and it seems like it's actually really good news for Paradox.</p>
<p>Lately, Paradox have had quite a lot of issues with their releases. From cancelling games completely, to DLC for various games that have reviewed pretty poorly overall. So it's nice to see that Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power, at least from Steam user reviews, is showing up really well with a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>What's new in the DLC the main points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative Government:</strong> Experience medieval rule outside of the feudal system with a new style of empire management. A web of Governors jockeys for position in the empire with intrigue and power, sometimes rewarding merit and sometimes rewarding perfidy. Only a truly skilled Emperor can keep these squabbling forces in line.</li>
<li><strong>The Family Estate:</strong> Run and manage a powerful Family Estate, the seat of your House’s power, even when you hold no other land. Construct new buildings and improvements to further your power and influence within an administrative empire.</li>
<li><strong>Influence System:</strong> Build up a character’s influence within an administrative empire to climb the rungs of bureaucracy. Raise your status in the realm and gather more power for yourself. Start as a landless noble on an estate, and compete for valuable provinces to govern before making your bid for the Purple.</li>
<li><strong>A Life of Adventure:</strong> Freely roam the map, untied to any realm or holding, going wherever the winds of fortune blow you. Fulfill contracts as a landless adventurer, even through the generations, building up a reputation of your own. Earn gold, prestige and fame traveling the globe until you decide to settle down and claim land you have earned through merit.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Successor or Caesar:</strong> Spend the influence you have gathered to determine the course of the Empire and get the successor you want, whether a royal family member, a powerful noble, a martial hero, or any other candidate you can rally the people behind. The Emperor can even opt to co-rule if the burden of the throne is too much for one person.</li>
<li><strong>New Byzantine Flavor Content:</strong> New events, monuments and activities built around the Byzantine theme, including chariot racing.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetic Additions:</strong> A Byzantine-themed UI skin and new court fashions for your characters, new 2D event art, new on-map monuments of the Byzantine world, new on-map holding designs, and a Byzantine throne room for Royal Court sessions, among other aesthetic improvements. New music inspired by Orthodox holy chants is also included.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ueVWWXG4JRg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c13aca10707d876d47f39ec28b10a008.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ueVWWXG4JRg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full details on all the changes available on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/now-available-roads-to-power-free-1-13-0-basileus-update.1705102/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paradox forum</a>. As usual for Paradox strategy games, it's lengthy and wordy and full of adjustments everywhere. The free patch that was released with it is also, surprisingly, pretty darn feature-filled as well containing a bunch of new game rules you can use, they added Court View and Court Artifacts to base game, historical characters can now appear across the map, a new starting year option, new events and so on.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting new free features for all players though is the "Choose a New Destiny" feature, so that you get to pick what happens to your game after you die - as long as you have a valid heir that is. The new options sound quite fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When you die, you now get the opportunity to switch to another character of your Dynasty that is not necessarily your direct Heir. Our game is a dynastic simulator, and we want to unlock playing through more branches of your Dynasty!</li>
<li>Players will be offered up to three categories of Destiny characters: An Interesting Destiny, a Challenging Destiny, and an Adventurous Destiny. Each category aims to offer a different flavor. The last category specifically will allow you to go Adventuring, if you own Roads to Power!</li>
<li>You can also select a Favorite Child (direct child or grand-child), who will then always appear as a New Destiny character. They will not get any extra titles or gold - in fact their siblings might get a bit jealous of their ‘favorite’ status.</li>
<li>For those who like to roll the Die of Fate - we have a special “Random Destiny” option with several random variants, to continue as any Dynasty character. It might still be your Heir, if that is what Fate determines.</li>
<li>You only get to Choose a New Destiny if you have a valid heir when you die. Securing your succession is an important part of CK3, and we want everyone to keep respecting that goal.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Din&#39;s Champion is dynamic rogue-lite RPG styled like Terraria from Soldak Entertainment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soldak Entertainment make some pretty quirky RPGs with a good few die-hard fans, and now they're trying something a bit different with Din's Champion.</p>
<p>Blending the basic theme of Terraria with 2D side-scrolling where you mine and gather resources, craft items and explore the world but with Soldak's dynamic RPG systems to give you a really unique game. The graphical style of it is a bit…<em>odd</em>, it looks like a Terraria "HD" mod almost but it seems to make up for it in all the gameplay systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9055945611727360653gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You have to build up a town, which can end up with 100s of NPCs that you can equip to help you out. Which you'll probably need, since the monsters can "form uprisings, start wars, set up ambushes, and attack your town". Heck, even without monsters there's a lot going on. Your NPCs can get plagues and curses, you have sneaky assassins to worry about too and then there's the physics system with various terrain that will collapse around you, gases can build up, liquids will be flowing and much more.</p>
<p>Character creation and upgrades sound interesting too, with the developer noting there's "over 50,000 combinations". Each run through should be unique with different bosses, biomes, monsters, items, traps, objects, and quests with is where the whole rogue-lite thing comes in.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a dynamic, evolving, living world where your choices truly impact the game.</li>
<li>Build your character as you see fit (attributes, specialties/classes, skills, and items).</li>
<li>Explore a unique area of Aleria in every game, with different bosses, biomes, monsters, items, and quests, giving the player a new experience every time.</li>
<li>Craft armor, weapons, tools, potions, materials, and town objects.</li>
<li>Build and defend your town from active threats trying to destroy you.</li>
<li>Shape the world through mining, building, and destruction.</li>
<li>Battle hundreds of different monster types.</li>

<p>The latest Dwarf Fortress update has been released bringing with it some needed fixes, along with babies and some fun news about modding.</p>
<p>This is a Fortress Mode update, separate from the opt-in Adventure Mode Beta which still isn't ready for a main release just yet. The devs gave a word of warning though that it might nukes saves until a Steam issue is solved. Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4657374909372690154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux trainer crash fixed (again).</li>
<li>Added crash guard for bad civilian alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics additions/changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Dwarves/humans/elves/goblins/kobolds have child and baby images, new equipment, and palette support.</li>
<li>Garden and crop plants have more images.</li>
<li>Mandible portrait fixed for experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other bug fixes/tweaks</p>
<ul>
<li>Good/bad thoughts about tombs work.</li>
<li>Poisonous forgotten beasts work more reliably.</li>
<li>Various minor tweaks to input/layout.</li>
<li>Fixed drinks being destroyed on unretire.</li>
<li>Fixed a few broken sorts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The extra fun bit though — Lua modding is coming. They said it will allow you to "literally change the code to make custom behaviours and adapt the systems more expansively than ever" and it will also be the foundation for "the upcoming procedural magic system which will be added to all modes". Check out the video on it:</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.4.1 brings improvements for launchers, more robust D3D8, lots of game fixes for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11 for Linux used in Wine / Proton, DXVK version 2.4.1 is out today. This is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> able to run so many Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of improvements in this release!</p>
<h4>General improvements</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The size for memory chunks is now determined dynamically based on the amount of memory the application has already allocated.<br/>
This should improve the out-of-the-box behaviour in various game launchers; the <code class="inline-code">dxvk.maxChunkSize</code> option was removed accordingly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Vulkan swap chain would not always be recreated appropriately in a native Wayland environment. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4252" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4252</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with descriptor pools growing too large on Nvidia cards in some situations. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4166" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4166</a>)</li>
<li>Changed default shader code generation for DXBC <code class="inline-code">mad</code> instructions to work around flickering issues in games that use different vertex shaders to render the same geometry in multiple render passes. The <code class="inline-code">d3d11.longMad</code> and <code class="inline-code">d3d9.longMad</code> options were removed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4></h4>
<h4>D3D8 / D3D9</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall robustness of the D3D8 implementation with error handling and fixed various memory leaks.</li>
<li>Slightly improved performance by optimizing vertex buffer uploads. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4275" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4275</a>)</li>
<li>Significantly improved performance in some games using Software Vertex Processing. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4274</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed full-screen presentation issues in some Game Maker games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4245" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4245</a>)</li>
<li>Removed <code class="inline-code">VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT</code> from textures that don't need it. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4176" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4176</a>)</li>
<li>Enabled strict float emulation by default on AMDVLK now that this driver optimizes the pattern emitted by DXVK. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4203" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4203</a>). Do note that this was already the case on RADV.</li>
<li><strong>Chrome: Gold Edition</strong>: Enabled 60 FPS limit to work around game issues at higher frame rates. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4260</a>)</li>

<p>For the full detail see the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.4.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you don't actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the wild side, you can upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut is a big free upgrade coming in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slay the Princess is probably one of the best horror visual novels around, with absolutely glowing reviews everywhere and it's about to get bigger, for free. The developers have announced Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut, a free upgrade that's going to release on October 24th.</p>
<p>In short it's going to add in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expands the game by roughly 35%. This means thousands of new voice lines, over a thousand new illustrations, and 17 tracks of brand new music.</li>
<li>Adds significant glow-ups for The Fury, The Den, and the Apotheosis, each of which has over three times as much stuff to see as they had in the base game.</li>
<li>Introduces three brand new Princesses that branch off of The Damsel, the Prisoner, and the Spectre.</li>
<li>Adds an entirely new ending to the game.</li>
<li>Adds a deep, interactive gallery to help you chart your progress across over 420 unlocks and that brings back your best (and worst) memories with the Princess.</li>
<li>Provides subtitle support for: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, European Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, German, Polish, French, Russian, and Italian.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It will also be coming to traditional consoles.</em></p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Valve dev Mike Blumenkrantz details a new proposal for speedier Wayland Protocols development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the news recently about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/frog-protocols-announced-to-try-and-speed-up-wayland-protocol-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Frog Protocols for Wayland</a> coming from another frustrated Valve developer, now Mike Blumenkrantz has jumped in with a different proposal to speed things up.</p>
<p>I won't repeat all the issues but in short: Wayland Protocols take too long to be developed, reviewed and actually made into a real thing due to various governance problems. So in a fresh blog post titled "<a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/My-Wayland-Your-Wayland-Our-Wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My Wayland Your Wayland Our Wayland</a>", Blumenkrantz announced their new proposal that essentially boils down to adding in an official "experimental" stage for protocols.</p>
<p>As detailed in the currently open <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/339" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wayland-protocols has struggled with development practices for many years. This stagnation typically comes in two flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>barrier to entry</li>
<li>review hell</li>
</ul>
<p>By adding a third stage of protocol lifetimes, the "experimental" stage, the barrier to entry for new protocol development can be lowered, and momentum can be established in order to carry new protocols through <code class="inline-code">staging/</code> to <code class="inline-code">stable/</code> and broad adoption.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">experimental/</code> - breaking changes allowed, iterative development</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">staging/</code> - no breaking changes allowed, protocols are versioned, fewer changes expected, begin deployment/testing</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">stable/</code> - no breaking changes allowed, versioning is still permitted, no changes expected, safe for production use</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Blumenkrantz goes into a fair bit more detail on how it would work, and it does sound like a promising idea, along with a change to how other developers involved will "vote" on if they think it's good or not that will hopefully prevent experimental protocols sitting forever never getting properly reviewed.</p>
<p>Additionally it looks like both Daniel Stone and Mike Blumenkrantz have been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/338" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accepted</a> into Wayland Protocols governance as members of Mesa.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws head to Steam as Ubisoft return to same-day releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems they all come back in the end. Ubisoft put out a new financial targets <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a>, and in it they confirmed a move back to same-day releases on Steam starting with Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has seen a release date delay and will now instead release on 14th February 2025, as Ubisoft say they are taking on the learnings from the "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws". On top of that they are "departing" from the Season Pass model with everyone getting access at the same time, and pre-orders will get the first expansion free.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is also coming to Steam and will release on 21st November.</p>
<p>From the statement release Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly, with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands.</p>
<p>Although the tangible benefits of the Company’s transformation are taking longer than anticipated to materialize, we keep on our strategy, focusing on two key verticals – Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences – with the objective to drive growth, recurrence and robust free cash flow generation in our business.</p>
<p>In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players. As a result, beyond the first important short-term actions undertaken, the Executive Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, is launching a review aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.</p>
<p>Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform Nexus Mods app adds support for Mod Collections, fixes REDmod on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app that's currently in development has a new 0.6.1 release available for testing with some nice improvements. Eventually this will replace Vortex when it's ready.</p>
<p>Firstly, as a reminder, if you've tested previous versions you need to <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/faq/#why-do-i-have-to-uninstall-everything-to-update-the-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">completely remove</a> everything. As it's early days, they're not supporting app upgrades yet. That will come much later.</p>
<p>As for what's new: the big one is a Collections feature, which is still experimental. This allows you to install multiple mods together in one. Currently only supports mods from Nexus Mods and it's only available for Premium users right now but eventually free users will be able to use it.</p>
<p>There's also some new UI work to use the new tree view, and grouped by the mod page on Nexus Mods. Grouping can be turned off too if you wish.</p>

<p>Some more enhancements for Cyberpunk 2077 modding as well, like detecting if the REDmod DLC is missing and prompt the user to install it if required. Additionally, they fixed up REDmod on Linux as they've set up a framework for Windows apps / tools on Linux <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1989" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using Protontricks</a>. Nice to see one open source project help another — this is why open source is great.</p>
<p><em>The app still only works with Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley until more features are rolled out.</em></p>

      <title>Metro Awakening (VR) releases November 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vertigo Games are releasing the VR game Metro Awakening on November 7, so it may be time to dust off your VR kit for this one. Hopefully SteamVR and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> will be able to handle it. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">even more hints towards Valve's next VR system</a>, it would be a good time for Valve to keep improving SteamVR for Linux wouldn't it.</p>
<p>It's a standalone prequel to Metro 2033, so you don't even need to have played the others in the series.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YH2LUgJQze0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2891a5098c6e37cd74c683d5e059358c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YH2LUgJQze0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds releases February 28, 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the two previous games World and RISE being Steam Deck Verified, I'm hopeful that Monster Hunter Wilds will also be playable on Steam Deck (and Desktop Linux) with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> when it launches February 28, 2025.</p>
<p>The release date was announced during Sony's State of Play and if you've played any of the previous games, you'll largely know what to expect. Big battles against lots of varied fearsome foes. The new trailer shows off the flagship monster at the center of the story in Monster Hunter Wilds, Arkveld. The trailer also showcases plenty of the different environments and weather systems at play too. Definitely looks to be the most varied in the series so far.</p>
<p>Brand new trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZMBqJZW6_9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d35cd84b87220aa01f81c446578e3fc6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZMBqJZW6_9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I have to admit I'm really out of date on Monster Hunter, I really need to go back through the last two and give them a thorough play-through as this really looks awesome. Will you be picking it up?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order on Steam</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-releases-october-31-with-the-playstation-overlay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> wasn't the only Horizon announcement from Sony's State of Play, with LEGO Horizon Adventures set to arrive on November 14.</p>
<p>Like other Sony releases it will require a PlayStation Network Account. They haven't mentioned the PlayStation Overlay though that breaks online play for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-only-on-steam-deck-due-to-playstation-network-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT</a> on Steam Deck / Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, requires a workaround for Desktop Linux in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a> and will be included in Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered too.

      <title>Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered announced for December 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered are real and they're coming to PC on December 10, with Aspyr Media once again taking control of updating older games.</p>
<p>Much like Aspyr did with STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter, STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection and Tomb Raider I-III Remastered. While no doubt the awful release of the Battlefront Classic Collection is still in some peoples minds, this is a single-player game, so no server-issue problems (and their other two releases are positively reviewed).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7pRyL8y7vZ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac9868131b631dd3e413e1152e50cefc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7pRyL8y7vZ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Aspyr said they were able to get the full source code from Crystal Dynamics so they have the basis for all the "exact same combat, puzzles, and boss fights, with the same balance and feel, as the original" - so it should be pretty difficult to mess this one up.</p>
<p>What can we actually expect from it then? Updated controls and camera controls, updated graphics, there's now a map and compass to assist your travels, a photo mode, real-time shadows, a day and night cycle (that was cut from the original release), a graphics toggle between new and old and more.</p>
<p>Unless Aspyr do something weird it should work fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>The new Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailer shows off a really big dragon fight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is releasing October 31st, and the latest trailer shown off during Sony's State of Play is action-packed.</p>
<p>The game is already Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, so it should hopefully work well. That goes for Desktop Linux too. If it's verified on the Deck, your chosen desktop Linux distribution should be good to go too. That is, unless it needs some silly launch option <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like God of War Ragnarök</a>.</p>
<p>The latest trailer is mostly a big dragon fight, and exactly what I wanted to see from it, check it out below:</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>

<ul>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered releases October 31 with the PlayStation Overlay</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it really didn't need it, October 31 will give us Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered as announced during Sony's State of Play. Yes really, it's happening, it's a real thing.</p>
<p>Hold on a minute, it's how old? No, it can't be. How is it 7 years since the original release? Is time speeding up as I get older or what?</p>
<p>The current version of the game works well on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, and is Steam Deck Verified. However, the new Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered might come with some issues, as Sony confirmed in their blog post it will have the PlayStation Overlay, which is what completely breaks online play for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-only-on-steam-deck-due-to-playstation-network-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully it's not forced, and perhaps it will have an opt-out for Steam Deck like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which means Desktop Linux users may need the launch option.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer anyway:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kMN-x9goE7M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4633a82298831f83c32935416575c385.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kMN-x9goE7M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sony say it will have "over 10 hours of re-recorded conversation, mocap and countless graphical improvements that bring the game to the same visual fidelity as its critically acclaimed sequel Horizon Forbidden West". You will also see various upgrades to characters that brings "them in line with current generation advances in character models and rendering"</p>
<p>For the PC version there will be support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3.1 with frame generation, along with various accessibility features that were first introduced in Horizon Forbidden West.</p>
<p>The new edition will be a $9.99 upgrade for existing owners on PC.</p>

      <title>My Time at Evershine is the next from Pathea Games following My Time at Sandrock</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My Time is officially its own series now, with a third game announced recently with My Time at Evershine following on from My Time at Sandrock and My Time at Portia.</p>
<p>Both previous games work great on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. My Time at Sandrock is also Steam Deck Verified, with My Time at Portia only Steam Deck Playable - so their support got better with the more recent game. For this one, they say on their new Kickstarter in the FAQ it will support the Steam Deck again too. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign launched today, and met the goal in only 35 minutes with it nearly hitting $330,000 already and it jumps up every time I look. Clearly the My Time series remains popular.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Y4nq2iN6ZmU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/efa42a3522e8ee37335b1d6c95827877.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Y4nq2iN6ZmU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All New Story-driven Campaign - </strong>Be the Governor of a brand-new settlement on the fringes of the Free Cities, facing the almighty Duvos Empire. Recruit settlers, build infrastructure, tame the wilds, and lead your people to create a new idyllic stronghold for the Alliance filled with enchanting characters and memorable stories to enjoy. As tensions rise and a powerful antagonist emerges, the stakes are higher than ever, expect surprising twists, heartfelt moments, plenty of adventure, and hours of fun.</li>
<li><strong>New Art Direction - </strong><em>My Time At Evershine</em> is the most beautiful and realistic game in the franchise to date. Environments are more expansive and varied, characters look more realistic, and animations are motion-captured to create a more believable world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiplayer Co-op - </strong>For the first time in the <em>My Time</em> series, the campaign can be enjoyed both solo and in co-op mode with up to four players, making it perfect for family and friends. The host controls the pace of the main story, while all players share resources and money, allowing everyone to collaborate and contribute to the adventure together.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build a Society - </strong>This ambitious sequel casts players as the all-powerful Governor, who can not only build new facilities, and explore but also command a team of recruitable and customizable NPCs. These NPCs handle the routine tasks like construction and resource gathering, allowing the Governor to focus on more larger, important decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Meaningful Relationships - </strong>Social play was a key part of <em>My Time At Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time At Portia.</em> In <em>My Time At Evershine</em> Pathea is set to expand these systems even further. Players can recruit up to 3 followers to stay with them during day-to-day tasks or they can dispatch them to do their bidding across Northern Eufala. In this new installment, relationship-building is even more dynamic, with additional poses, interactions, and flirting options. RPG players will love the deep character interactions and the ability to forge meaningful relationships, with romanceable characters integrated into the storyline and more opportunities to develop connections earlier in the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Tame A Wild New Frontier - </strong>3 years after the events of<em> My Time at Sandrock</em>, the Duvos Empire has taken over the Orzu Ruins which Ethea also claims as their own, leading to a tense situation just north of the Alliance of Free Cities border in the Northern Eufaula region. In response, the Alliance has launched the North Development Plan to move settlers into the area and establish a new City-State for better defense. Evershine is one of six major new settlements in the area and will prove pivotal in the ongoing hostilities.</li>
<li><strong>Mod Support - </strong><em>My Time at Evershine</em> will endeavor to include full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to customize and expand their RPG experience. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, the possibilities for creativity and new content are endless.</li>
</ul>

<p>They've certainly come a long way since Planet Explorers from 2016, where they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/planet-explorers-goes-free-as-pathea-games-lose-the-multiplayer-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lost a bunch of code in 2019</a> and ended up making it free. Nice to see them now doing so well. They also ended up releasing the <a href="https://github.com/pathea-games/planetexplorers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code</a> for Planet Explorers, although it's <em>not</em> open source.</p>

      <title>Fight off the immense hordes in Halls of Torment 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's finally here and it's finished. Halls of Torment, my favourite bullet-heaven survivor-like that has the style of classic Diablo with Vampire Survivor gameplay is out now.</p>
<p>Absolutely packed full of content. Fight across 6 stages, with 11 playable characters and 100s of items and variants to find. You'll find over 35 unique bosses, over 70 unique monsters, 500 quests to complete and a whole lot of quests to do to unlock various traits and upgrades.</p>
<p>With the 1.0 release today it adds in the last main stage, new challenges, artifacts that will modify the gameplay, new game modes, 16:10 support, lots of quality of life fixes and loads more to find. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JdQweTEsOUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12e755eacdb544b3aa69cb5d13f9b108.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JdQweTEsOUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "We're very excited for the 1.0 release of Halls of Torment. It's been an extraordinary journey for us so far, and we're looking forward to seeing the players' reactions to the feature complete version of the game. We've added a lot of late game content for seasoned HoT players, but at the same time we've also improved the experience for newcomers. We think it has become a solid and well-rounded game, and we hope a lot of new players will enjoy it."</p>
<p>While it's technically finished, they will still be updating it although they admit they "don’t know exactly how to proceed next" but there will be smaller updates and perhaps some additional features to come.</p>
<p>Nice to see another <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> game with Native Linux support see a full release! It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>An incredibly easy recommendation for you. It doesn't get easier than this for me: just go buy it. Great fun. </p>
<p>You <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Advance Wars fans should check out Athena Crisis with the 1.0 release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a heavy dose of ideas from Advance Wars, Nakazawa Tech / Null Games released the 1.0 version of Athena Crisis.</p>
<p>What to expect from it? Well, if you somehow don't know what Advance Wars is: Athena Crisis is a modern turn-based strategy game that brings a full single-player campaign, ranked and casual online multiplayer modes with up to 7 players at once. Plus there's a map and campaign editor too, so hopefully a nice community of content will build up around it. The main code behind it is also open source too!</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bWC1JOyP1EI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/957e42235f0080621395ae529edc1008.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bWC1JOyP1EI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what the developer had to say about it: "I became a huge fan of the Advance Wars series after playing the original game as a teenager when it came out. I wanted to bring back memories of the unforgettable feeling of trying to solve complex challenges while enjoying a beautiful pixel art game with great music" said Christoph Nakazawa, founder of Nakazawa Tech. "Athena Crisis is a faster and modern interpretation of the formula with its seamless multiplayer and multi-platform approach. We've been working in the open with the community to make the game as good as possible for our full release – and we are excited to keep improving the game and continue building the world of Athena Crisis in the future."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command 40+ infantry, ground, naval and air units in turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Explore seven environments with unique play-styles.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a robust campaign with more than 40 maps filled with memorable characters.</li>

<li>Seamless cross-device single and multiplayer with automatic game state synchronization.</li>
<li>Unlock unique skills, secret units, and compete for the top score at defeating each map.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it is also Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Behaviour Interactive has acquired Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, Behaviour Interactive who made Dead by Daylight announced they have acquired Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media the Behaviour Interactive account <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The way is lit. The path is clear.”<br/>
<br/>
Today, we’re ecstatic to announce our acquisition of Red Hook Studios. Darkest Dungeon has long been a series we’ve admired, enjoyed (and maybe even lost a little sleep over) as fans, and the opportunity to welcome Red Hook as a fully independent studio under the Behaviour banner is nothing short of a thrill. We look forward to supporting Red Hook as they continue to do what they do best: put your sanity to the test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will no doubt sting a little, and continues to show the gaming industry being quite messy, considering Behaviour Interactive closed down Midwinter Entertainment and cancelled their Project T <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-project-t-has-been-cancelled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only six days ago</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15957532041727185090gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15957532041727185090gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Darkest Dungeon II</em></p>
<p>From the press releases:</p>
<p>"It's a privilege to welcome a developer of Red Hook's caliber," stated Rémi Racine, Behaviour's co-founder and CEO. "Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher – to make Behaviour synonymous with horror and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games. Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come."</p>
<p>"We've found kindred spirits in the Behaviour team," stated Chris Bourassa, Red Hook's co-founder. "Both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games. Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities. Behaviour's support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook's future and focus fully on transforming Darkest Dungeon into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre."</p>
<p>"Joining forces with Behaviour is exciting on multiple levels," added Tyler Sigman, the second of Red Hook's co-founders. "They have demonstrated a commitment to allowing our team to continue developing Darkest Dungeon in the manner we know best, but with the benefit of their considerable knowledge and resources. We are stronger together than apart. Critically, there is a shared love of Darkest Dungeon, and with Behaviour's help, we can delve even deeper into the franchise."</p>
<p>"Darkest Dungeon offers a natural complement to Dead by Daylight," stated Stephen Mulrooney, Behaviour's Chief Product and Technical Officer. "Both franchises occupy unique points on the horror spectrum, and both offer their players deep, innovative gameplay and original, eldritch worlds. We're so excited to add Darkest Dungeon to Behaviour's horror portfolio. Not just because we're huge fans of the games, but also because of the unparalleled creativity and passion demonstrated by Chris, Tyler, and every member of the Red Hook team."</p>

      <title>Chill diorama builder Tiny Glade is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you like just chilling and building things as if you're painting the screen, then you may want to take a look at Tiny Glade that just released.</p>
<p>As casual as gaming comes, Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game where you just build up whatever you want. There's no timers, no quests, no combat. Just you doodling some castles or whatever else you can come up with. This was easily going to be a hit and it certainly is with it already getting an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from users on Steam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CdWpq2efN8Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3320c22e3b2f4c041ffa8fcb1f88e0c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CdWpq2efN8Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo was really impressive with the way everything just flows together so nicely. It may not be the type of game I'm personally going to go and pick up, but that doesn't stop me being impressed by what the developer managed to do with it.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. For the nerds: according to a social media <a href="https://x.com/h3r2tic/status/1838251514168574026" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the developer it uses Rust and Vulkan.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-14 brings fixes for Star Citizen, God of War Ragnarök and other games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 9-14 has been released bringing in more game fixes for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, for those who need the extras.</p>
<p>As your reminder: it's a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>This release pulls in a change for God of War Ragnarök, specifically for Desktop Linux users, so you'll no longer need the launch option to pretend you're running a Steam Deck. Plus a few other game-specific fixes, and the usual updates from all the upstream projects like DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, Wine and others.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-14" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>Update dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi to latest git</li>
<li>Import upstream proton changes</li>
<li>Update mono to 9.3.0</li>
<li>Rebase wine-staging</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added god of war ragnarok SteamDeck=1 workaround (thanks UserNamesAreNotMyThing)</li>
<li>Added Star Citizen libcuda nvidia fix (thanks ProjectSynchro)</li>
<li>Added fix for Plain Site (thanks iodream)</li>
<li>Added fix for Worms: Blast (thanks iodream)</li>
<li>Remove deprecated Sleeping Dogs: DE fix</li>
<li>winetricks now built from source</li>
<li>Elden Ring fix updated (thanks UserNamesAreNotMyThing)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.15 Beta: Zoomer Edition released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>There's only one single fix with this release <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4676514574298208466?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>

<li>Improved session recovery speed after GPU crashes.</li>
<li>Enabled support for Bluetooth A2DP and BAP profiles.</li>
<li>Improved display uniformity, under some conditions (Mura Compensation).</li>
<li>support for some HDMI CEC features in the Deck Dock.</li>
<li>BIOS overclocking controls on Steam Deck LCD.</li>
<li>+ much more.</li>

      <title>Frog Protocols announced to try and speed up Wayland protocol development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One day, Wayland will truly take over the Linux world, but it's not quite there yet with plenty still using X11 due to various problems some of which the new Frog Protocols aim to solve.</p>
<p>Announced by <em>misyl</em>, who does various work for Valve (like Gamescope), it certainly sounds like a good idea to give Wayland Protocols a swift kick to get into gear to improve things for users. Writing on their <a href="https://idtech.space/notice/AmJ60Dc5Vn0yigcxPM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayland Protocols has long had a problem with new protocols sitting for months, to years at a time for even basic functionality.</p>
<p>This is hugely problematic when some protocols implement very primitive and basic functionality such as frog-fifo-v1, which is needed for VSync to not cause GPU starvation under Wayland and also fix the dreaded application freezing when windows are occluded with FIFO/VSync enabled.</p>
<p>We need to get protocols into end-users hands quicker! The main reason many users are still using X11 is because of missing functionality that we can be shipping today, but is blocked for one reason or another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can learn more on the <a href="https://github.com/misyltoad/frog-protocols" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and see the open Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31329/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to hopefully get the frog-fifo-v1 protocol into upstream Mesa drivers.</p>
<p>Looking at the Merge Request, it's explained that SteamOS (Steam Deck) and Gamescope are already "shipping essentially this functionality" since version 3.5 as it's a "serious and genuine problem".</p>
<p>There's already a little bit of push-back from one developer Simon Ser who <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31329/#note_2580654" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think adding support for protocols essentially bypassing the wayland-protocols consensus is a good idea. The bar in wayland-protocols is not that high, and adding support for third-party protocols not representative of the Wayland community isn't a good way forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which had a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31329/#note_2580740" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reply</a> from Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is value in rapid iteration that the current development model is missing out on. If this would be better as an ext hosted on the upstream wayland-protocols repo, that seems fine to me as well, but I'm not sure that there needs to be a bar at all for an ext protocol other than being available for whoever wants to use it. On the contrary, reducing friction there would provide invaluable experimental feedback to the upstream development effort, and serve users during those long development cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting times, but it's good that something is being done to hopefully kick things up a notch and improve things, especially when it comes to gaming, for the rest of us.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform remote play app for PlayStation adds controller mapping, custom renderer options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have a PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4 and want to stream games to something else like your PC or Steam Deck, chiaki-ng is what you need and it just got a great upgrade in version 1.9.0.</p>
<p>Originally called chiaki4deck where it vastly improved Steam Deck support over the original chiaki open source project, it was later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/playstation-remote-play-app-gets-renamed-to-chiaki-ng-chiaki-next-generation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">renamed</a> to chiaki-ng (chiaki-next-generation) to better showcase that it's for all platforms.</p>
<p>The new v1.9.0 release brings with it some big new features like a feature to allow you to fully configure the mapping for your controller, which they say is "especially nice for mapping Xbox and Switch controllers to PlayStation inputs". You also now get more control over how the stream displays with custom option support.</p>
<p>All the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>adds <strong>Controllers</strong> section to chiaki-ng settings which allows you to configure the mapping for your controller (especially nice for mapping Xbox and Switch controllers to PlayStation inputs) [Note: Controllers mapped via Steam should be mapped directly in the Steam UI gamepad configurator as opposed to this menu. If you try to map a controller that is mapped via Steam in this menu it will give you a notification that it should be mapped via Steam.]</li>
<li>adds Custom renderer option which allows you to configure your renderer options very granularly with the options at <a href="https://libplacebo.org/options/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://libplacebo.org/options/</a></li>
<li>add defaults to all settings so users are aware of the defaults/which settings they've changed</li>
<li>add different haptic rumble intensity settings for users to configure if the default is not to their liking</li>
<li>add ability to hide un-registered discovered consoles</li>
<li>for manual connection show 1 pane with all relevant information instead of 2 panes when console is discovered + allow user to choose between registered consoles (regardless of whether or not they are currently discovered) + make PS5 default console type</li>
<li>disable double click for fullscreen by default and allow re-enabling via the <strong>Video</strong> section of the Settings</li>
<li>fix crash when user has more than 1 PS5 registered with PSN</li>
<li>fix crash that could happen when a user uses the wake from sleep feature</li>
<li>fix corrupt stream that could occur after several hours of streaming</li>
<li>fix launching from a path with non-ascii characters on Windows</li>
<li>fix decimal points turning into scientific notation numbers in QSliders</li>
<li>properly terminate ipv6 discovery service</li>
<li>ping all network interfaces on Linux and MacOS allowing discovery of previously undiscovered consoles</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fallen Aces from Trey Powell, Jason Bond and New Blood Interactive quickly became popular after the initial Early Access release in June and now it has Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Valve initially rated the game as Unsupported, due to various problems from performance to crashes. Thankfully it should be all good now.

      <title>Sega Saturn styled racer Parking Garage Rally Circuit is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving on Steam with Linux support is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, an indie racing game from Walaber Entertainment designed like a long lost Sega Saturn game. It certainly looks the part too, so for those of you who enjoy something a little more nostalgic but with modern touches this is for you.</p>
<p>Seems Steam players are enjoying it too with it getting a quick Very Positive rating.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lcxRmvn8KXY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ed0fa1ee4af04797f6541af58162acc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lcxRmvn8KXY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As the developer explains the gameplay: "This is a hybrid of Rally and circuit racing. From rally it draws the jumps and “one racer at a time against the clock” time-trial format. However, the tracks are similar to circuit racing, with each race consisting of multiple laps around the same track (the track may change slightly from lap to lap, however) Controls are very tight, simple and arcadey, similar to Mario Kart (accelerate, reverse, steer, drift), but with a bit more dynamic “smash into things” physics."</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. No Steam Deck rating yet but should run great.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Just a To the Moon Series Beach Episode from Freebird Games is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One new release missed from last week, with Freebird Games launching Just a To the Moon Series Beach Episode. The latest in their popular series of story-rich 2D pixel-art adventure games, and like their previous it comes with Native Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12558914631727084383gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As usual, the description the developer gives is not exactly clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beach Episode(TM) of To the Moon, Finding Paradise, and Impostor Factory.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Or is it?</em><br/>
<br/>
...Yes, it technically is. <em>Just A To the Moon Series Beach Episode</em> is just that: A To the Moon series beach episode.<br/>
<br/>
Get ready for a new short adventure as the SigCorp. crew takes off to an all-expenses-paid vacation at the Golden Lobster Hotel &amp; Resort! For a grand total of 1 day, which is apparently the most the company was willing to fork out. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<br/>
Join familiar faces from <em>To the Moon, Finding Paradise, </em>and <em>Impostor Factory</em> in this narrative adventure filled with mini-games of varying elements, mysteries and relaxation, as well as--<br/>
<br/>
Wait, most of the characters here should already be dead.....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers say it's about 2-3 hours long, and they said clearly not to exit during the credits, so there's probably some sort of surprise there.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's not technically the end either. They said confusingly it's "half of an ending". More is to come, sort-of, with their next planned game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2664600/The_Last_Hour_of_an_Epic_TO_THE_MOON_RPG/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Last Hour of an Epic TO THE MOON RPG</a> that will release at some point (no dates mentioned).</p>
<p>You can buy Just a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2159210/Just_a_To_the_Moon_Series_Beach_Episode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">To the Moon Series Beach Episode on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>That's not a complete list, as the developers mentioned they're "still learning what new games work as users test games and report their findings, so this list will get bigger as we receive new reports". The <a href="https://github.com/RipleyTom/rpcn/releases/tag/1.3.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for RPCN 1.3 mention various other fixes too.</p>
<p>Nice to see more features of games saved from oblivion thanks to emulation and open source projects.</p>

      <title>Steam breaks 38 million concurrent users for the first time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's Steam just seem to be unstoppable lately, with another huge user milestone achieved over the weekend.</p>
<p>For the first time, the concurrent user count managed to rise over 38 million! 38,367,277 to be exact, according to the numbers on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. At the time 12,270,218 players were actually in-game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going over the data at the time these were the most-played games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>PUBG: Battlegrounds</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>NAKARA: BLADEPOINT</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Source SDK Base 2007 (GTA V FiveM - multiplayer mod)</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>

<p class="plain-list-title">Looking back over the history of Steam breaking user counts, it's clear that 2024 has been an insane year for the growth of Steam overall. This makes the 5th time just this year that the online count has been shattered and smashed through:</p>

      <title>Valve appear to be testing ARM64 and Android support for Steam on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve appear to have some pretty ambitious future plans for Steam, as we've seen recently in a leak (and not for the first time) that Valve has plans for ARM64 and Android support on Linux.</p>
<p>As usual, the leaks come thanks to SteamDB, which scrapes everything possible related to Steam. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3043620/history/?changeid=25321568" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest "ValveTestApp3043620"</a> appears to show various VR <em>and</em> standard non-VR games being tested on ARM64 with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> (the Windows to Linux compatibility layer). When you scroll down the list it shows this is thanks to an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX</a>, which "allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on an AArch64 host". It also mentions <a href="https://github.com/waydroid/waydroid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Waydroid</a>, an open source container system that allows you to run Android apps and games on a Linux-based system.</p>
<p>Before people think it's about any Windows and macOS stuff here, it seems <em>very</em> specific to Linux. The configuration text mentions how it's <em>from</em> Windows <em>to</em> Linux.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought this would have been purely for the long-rumoured "Deckard" VR headset, which I believe based on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/deckard-is-apparently-the-codename-for-a-possible-standalone-valve-vr-headset/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous</a> leaks will have a standalone mode that runs Linux (with an Arm processor) as well as being able to be hooked up to a PC. So it would make a <em>lot</em> of sense for Valve to be working on a system like this to extend Proton support to ARM64 <em>and</em> get Android-based apps / games working as well.</p>
<p>However, since the list included a lot of standard non-VR games too, it does beg the question: might we actually see Steam for Arm-based desktop devices too and not just whatever the new VR headset turns out to be? Definitely interesting times ahead. Valve's funding of various Linux-related open source projects will continue to pay off in the long run with the Steam Deck and whatever comes next.</p>
<p>Scrolling through the list it showed Valve testing compatibility for the likes of Pistol Whip (VR), Gorilla Tag (VR), Left 4 Dead 2, Garry's Mod, Shadow of Mordor and a great many more including various smaller indie games too.</p>
<p>Thinking back to how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer was announced originally</a>, it confirmed a long-held suspicion by many that the DXVK project was being funded by Valve to get the Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D into a good state. So who knows, perhaps Valve are doing similar funding for FEX and Waydroid developers well ahead of any announcements again.</p>
<p>Valve later wiped it (but SteamDB shows the history) and put it behind a protected token, so that SteamDB can't scrape it again in future until they set whatever it is live. Bit of a woops by Valve there, but this sort of thing has happened quite a few times in the past.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.14 Beta released with a Flatpak security fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small update to SteamOS 3.6 Beta for Steam Deck, bringing two small but important fixes as we're firmly on the road to the stable release.</p>
<p>Here's the changes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4676514574287490300" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.14</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Security fix for Flatpak (CVE-2024-42472).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed nested desktop crashing on launch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking up the Flatpak security issue: Prior to versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.10, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could access and write files outside of what it would otherwise have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality. It's been fixed in Flatpak 1.14.10 and Flatpak 1.15.10.</p>
<p>You can read more about the issue on <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> that was reported back in early August by Collabora engineer Simon McVittie.</p>

      <title>GTA V / GTAOnline highlights Steam Deck&#39;s verification system has problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, we had the news that Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated Grand Theft Auto V to include BattlEye anti-cheat</a>, and they have <em>not</em> enabled the Linux / Proton support that BattlEye offers. With that change, the online mode is now broken for Linux / Steam Deck. This just highlights an ongoing problem with the Steam Deck verification system.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V <em>was</em> rated as Steam Deck Playable by Valve. It would have actually been fully Steam Deck Verified if two issues were solved: the launcher being a nuisance, and setting the correct resolution by default. It even had a special Steam Deck Most Played banner on the Steam store page, because it was constantly in the top most played list every month. In this case, since it’s such a high-profile title, Valve did at least react quite quickly to change the Steam page to note it’s Unsupported a day later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11133295951726852983gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - How the Steam page looked until September 18th</em></p>
<p>Therein lies the problem. Steam Deck Verified is <em>all</em> Valve, it’s nothing to do with the original developers of the games that are being checked.</p>
<p>Developers cannot opt out of it (as far as we’ve been told so far) with the ratings getting automatically published after a while. Some developers, to their credit, are updating their games for Steam Deck support, it’s something we cover here on GamingOnLinux almost every day.</p>
<p>What this means though in reality is that even with a Steam Deck badge of approval, you’re technically buying a game on an <em>unsupported</em> platform, unless the developers themselves are clearly saying it’s supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20189621021726853100gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20189621021726853100gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Valve's new Steam Deck Unsupported status for GTA V</em></p>
<p>So with that in mind, even if developers are giving zero support for Linux-based platforms, they’re still going to end up with a verification badge of some sort with people buying them and playing them. That is, unless they specifically block Linux / Steam Deck, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-say-a-big-fat-no-to-proton-and-steam-deck-for-destiny-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bungie does with Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The thing is though, when you think about how it's being sold, the "blame" (if we wish to use that word) is on part both on Valve and Rockstar here. Valve for putting up the rating when the developer isn't giving it any support, and Rockstar for not blocking it and just taking the purchases. Rockstar would have been well aware it got given a rating.</p>
<p>GTAV is far from the first example of its kind. Looking back on it we’ve also had issues with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Battlefield 1 went from Steam Deck Playable to Unsupported, due to EA anticheat.</li>
<li>Battlefield V went from Steam Deck Playable to Unsupported, due to EA anticheat.</li>
<li>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2: Deluxe Edition went from Steam Deck Playable to Unsupported, due to EA anticheat.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Before people bring them up in the comments: Battlefield 2042 is also broken, but it never worked to begin with, as even when it had Easy Anti-Cheat (that supports Linux platforms) it was never enabled. Now it has EA anticheat too. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA SPORTS WRC</a> is similar, it was rated Unsupported but it <em>did</em> actually work and <em>now</em> it doesn’t due to EA anticheat. So while these two aren’t part of this specific topic right now, they do continue to highlight the <em>ongoing</em> anti-cheat issue.</p>
<p>And while Apex Legends works <em>currently</em>, there’s been repeating issues when the anti-cheat has been broken following updates, and a couple of times where Steam Deck / Linux players got banned and had to wait to be unbanned due to false flags there. Eventually, Apex Legends may even end up swapping from the Linux-supported Easy Anti-Cheat to EA anticheat like other EA published titles and break as well.</p>
<p>Single-player games largely aren’t a problem, although some have poor performance and yet <em>somehow</em> still get a Playable or Verified rating, which Valve do seem to be a bit inconsistent on.</p>
<p>To highlight the above a bit more. There’s a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3186865924592128220/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pinned post</a> in the official Steam Deck forum for people to report errors with the Steam Deck Verified program. That post has now accrued 1,060 replies with a big mixture of complaints about Verified games from poor overall performance, to the games completely crashing the Steam Deck system, some have completely broken textures, various videos not playing and the list goes on. It also shows a few posts talking about games that clearly deserve a <em>higher</em> rating than what Valve gave. So it's not just about broken games, but games that people see zero issues with rated incorrectly by Valve too.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s not to say the whole idea of Steam Deck Verified is <em>broken</em>, but in many cases, Valve <em>definitely</em> need to work more closely with developers rather than just sticking up a rating and calling it done. This is <em>especially</em> true for games that have online multiplayer, or if it’s the only mode the game has. I don't have any good solution in mind though, Valve obviously have people a lot smarter than me working on all this, but <em>something</em> should be done to prevent such negative headline-grabbing issues in future for the Steam Deck as a gaming platform. I obviously want to see it succeed probably more than most people.</p>
<p>You may at this point be thinking, but hey I read a fancy article recently that said Microsoft are banning kernel-level anti-cheat, so this will be all solved right? Well, no. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux has an article going over that</a> for you to read. In short: Microsoft have not said they’re doing so, just making a “new” platform for security. And <em>again</em>, developers can and <em>do</em> block Linux regardless of having kernel-level tomfoolery or not (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hi again Roblox</a>).</p>
<p>If Valve do ever plan to launch a Steam Deck 2, they’re going to need to overhaul the rating system anyway right? So, now is the time to get Steam Deck Verified tweaked and improved before more issues come up with a second-generation, and before more titles end up having to go from Playable or Verified to Unsupported because the developer wasn’t supporting it at all to begin with, as Rockstar have made plainly clear with their <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> entry for GTA V.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not into GTA V or any other title that’s been broken and don’t care: you really should. Each game being broken is a loss for overall support of the platform as a whole. It’s not a good look and it reduces choice for gamers.</p>
<p>I emailed Valve to talk about this issue with the verified program and they have not replied yet.</p>
<p>Before some comments come along to try and wriggle this into a “Native Linux is better” type of argument, that’s just <em>nonsense</em>. We’ve seen numerous games remove their Native Linux builds completely, or drop support for them, heck I wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/last-epoch-drops-the-native-linux-version-devs-tell-players-to-use-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one such case earlier today</a>. Native vs Proton is not the issue, platform <u><em>support</em></u> is, regardless of how the games are made to work.</p>
<p>On another note, while we’re on the subject of Steam Deck gaming, Proton and the rating system. Given how far <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve’s Proton</a> has come to where it now runs tens of thousands of Windows games without a fuss, perhaps it’s finally time for Valve to allow developers to <em>officially</em> list their games as supported via Proton for Linux-based platforms (regardless of Desktop Linux or Steam Deck). I did also email Valve to enquire about that back in <em>August</em>, and did not receive a reply.</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments: what are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>God of War Ragnarök released and Steam Deck Verified, needs a launch option for Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>God of War Ragnarök from Santa Monica Studio, Jetpack Interactive and PlayStation Publishing LLC has released on PC today and Valve put it quickly through verification for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While writing this article it was initially only noted via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2322010/history/?changeid=25320559" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, but checking back before publishing and the status is now live on the Steam page too. So it's fully Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3 that was also released recently</a>. Once again, Valve and their coders doing some amazing work to get AAA games working at release on Linux platforms like Steam Deck and desktops.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2255394591726850558gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game does require a PlayStation Network Account, so some regions will be unable to buy or play it. People were worried that the PlayStation Overlay, which is used in Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT and causes the online mode not to work, would be forced here again but it seems that's <em>not</em> the case.</p>
<p>However, this seems due to the developers putting in a hook to detect the Steam Deck, and simply not use the overlay if so. What this means is that for Desktop Linux players, you'll need to add this Steam launch option to pretend it's a Steam Deck to get it work:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>You can add this via right clicking on the game -&gt; properties -&gt; add it into the Launch Options text box.</p>
<p>This appears to come with some mouse issues though, so you'll need a gamepad for now, as mentioned in comments on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a> for it. You also might need to link your PlayStation and Steam accounts first to get it to work.</p>
<p>I'll admit, this one snuck-up on me and I forgot it was coming today, so I've not had a chance to take a look. I really hope though, that it runs better than the previous God of War game that had frequent Steam Deck lock-up crashes while also being Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Pocketpair respond to the Nintendo and Pokemon Company lawsuit for Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair, developers of Palworld, have put up a statement on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new lawsuit</a> that has been filed against them from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.<br/>
<br/>
We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.<br/>
<br/>
Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.<br/>
<br/>
As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>When it comes to what patent infringement Nintendo / Pokemon could be going after Pocketpair for, well, Nintendo actually have quite a number of patents that are for some very specific game mechanics. Which <em>could</em> be <em>really</em> problematic not just for Pocketpair, but all game developers looking to do anything similar.</p>
<p>Take for example <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7398425B2/en?oq=JP7398425B2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this patent</a> (approved in Japan, pending in the USA), that covers the feature of capturing creatures by throwing an object and sending out a character (like a Pokemon) to engage in combat. </p>
<p>Remember, this is not about copyright infringement, so they're not specifically going after any of the creature designs, but it's about the patents.</p>
<p>This is going to be a legal fight to remember. One perhaps for the history books.</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum releases March 4, 2025 with pre-orders up now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Studios and SEGA Europe announced that Two Point Museum is planned for launch now on March 4th, 2025 - with pre-orders now live.</p>
<p>Following on from their previous success with Two Point Hospital and then Two Point Campus, although you don't need to have played the others as each is standalone, it's a management sim where players can design the museum of their dreams. It will also have Native Linux support just like the two previous games.</p>
<p>More about it: "As fledgling curators, you have the task of designing and refining your very own museums to create the ultimate guest experience. Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones."</p>
<p>The release date announcement was also given a brief teaser video:</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Dawn of War II get free Anniversary Edition upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Relic Entertainment / SEGA have announced that all players that have Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II have been given a free upgrade to the new Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>From the announcements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fan-favourite and legendary release of Dawn of War and Dawn of War 2, originally developed by Relic Entertainment in 2004 and 2009 respectively, have just turned 20 and 15 years years old! To celebrate, we’ve put together two Anniversary Editions, collecting the original game with all its DLC and expansions, as well as a host of fun extras for fans. To celebrate 20 and 15 years of these seminal titles, the Anniversary Editions will be a free upgrade for all existing owners of Dawn of War 1, and Dawn of War 2!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5635405631726824077gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>So players who have Dawn of War will now get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Soulstorm</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Winter Assault</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade</li>
</ul>
<p>Players who have Dawn of War II will now get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising</li>
<li>All additional DLCs such as exclusive multiplayer army skins, and campaign and Last Stand wargear previously only available as DLC packs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is really nice to see. Currently this change only seems to be live for the Steam versions.</p>
<p>Dawn of War II does have an old Native Linux version from Feral Interactive. Although you may wish to use Valve's Proton due to no cross-platform online play.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch drops the Native Linux version, devs tell players to use Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Without any warning, Eleventh Hour Games have completely dropped support for and completely removed the Native Linux version of Last Epoch.</p>
<p>Initially, the patch notes didn't even mention Linux at all, but were later updated with the Steam Deck section expanded to include the notice. In the <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/last-epoch-the-imperial-uprising-event-patch-notes/73753#heading--steamdeck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> they state "We’re no longer building a native Linux client and recommend Linux players use Proton on Linux which provides a much better experience".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/914823771726822560gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For people who purchased specifically because it was advertised and sold on having a Native Linux version, it's not great and their communication after the fact is not a good look either. That said, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> often really does offer a better experience. A lot of the time because of various game engine issues and/or just not a lot of time spent improving the Linux version. So Linux desktop and Steam Deck players can thankfully still play the game. From what I've seen, many players were already using Proton for it due to various problems.</p>
<p>The game currently has a Steam Deck Playable rating with Proton 9.</p>
<p>As for their promised Steam Deck improvements, they have now added UI scaling options with the latest update. However, a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/7371918503944980372" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> noted they've pushed back some other changes as they "feel it’s important that when we say we are Steam Deck verified, players can trust that the experience they will receive on the Steam Deck is up to snuff with our expectations for player experience". So more to come there in future.</p>

      <title>Microsoft embraces more open standards with DirectX 12 adopting SPIR-V</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a big surprise, but truly a welcome one, and a great one for game developers. Microsoft are moving more towards open standards by adopting SPIR-V for DirectX.</p>
<p>Joining up with the Khronos SPIR and Vulkan working groups, once Shader Model 7 is released, it means DirectX 12 will accept shaders compiled to SPIR-V. This change could make it a whole lot simpler for developers to put their games on Linux, and make the job of Proton to get Windows games working on Linux / Steam Deck a bit easier too.</p>
<p>Some key parts of their announcement copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 8 years since Shader Model 6.0 was first introduced, Direct3D and HLSL have grown considerably in both features and adoption. Releasing DXC on GitHub and the tremendous contributions from open-source collaborators and partners played a significant role in expanding HLSL’s user base to include Vulkan and Metal developers. As a result of this expansion, the <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-hlsl-and-directx-support-to-clang-llvm/60783" rel="noopener" target="_blank">team is focusing on developing HLSL support in Clang</a> to enable us to keep up with industry demand for openness and new features. As we look end to end at the best way to support the full spectrum of our users, we are working hard to support HLSL for both DXIL and SPIR-V with Clang and LLVM.</p>
<p>To better enable HLSL’s Vulkan support, the HLSL team is now participating in The Khronos Group’s SPIR and Vulkan working groups. This direct participation will allow smoother collaboration and more rapid adoption of Vulkan features. We believe this will ensure that HLSL is the best language for writing shaders for every GPU runtime environment.</p>
<p><small>[…]</small></p>
<p>As we look to the future, maintaining a proprietary IR format (even one based on an open-source project) is counter to our commitments to open technologies, so Shader Model 7.0 will adopt SPIR-V as its interchange format. Over the next few years, we will be working to define a SPIR-V environment for Direct3D, and a set of SPIR-V extensions to support all of Direct3D’s current and future shader programming features through SPIR-V. This will allow developers to take better advantage of existing tools and unify the ecosystem around investing in one IR.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a compiler for HLSL to Direct3D’s SPIR-V, we will also be building and providing translation tools to translate SPIR-V to DXIL and DXIL to SPIR-V. Those tools will allow and driver developers to gradually transition and gracefully adapt tooling and drivers.</p>

      <title>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company file lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You might want to grab a big bucket of popcorn for this one, as the big fight is about to begin. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have formally gone after Palworld maker Pocketpair.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is specifically about alleged patent infringement. It's not exactly surprising though, considering Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-pokemon-company-confirm-investigation-into-palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in January</a> they were currently investigating Palworld. Obviously they felt there was enough to go through with a legal battle.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo Co., Ltd. (HQ: Kyoto, Minami-ku, Japan; Representative Director and President: Shuntaro Furukawa, “Nintendo” hereafter), together with The Pokémon Company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court against Pocketpair, Inc. (HQ: 2-10-2 Higashigotanda, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, “Defendant” hereafter) on September 18, 2024.</p>
<p>This lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that <em>Palworld</em>, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights.</p>
<p>Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Business lawyer Richard Hoeg <a href="http://x.com/HoegLaw/status/1836553535028367627" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posting</a> on X / Twitter brings up a good point here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably going to need more specifics before I can comment more completely, but Palworld is such a different type of game from Pokémon, it’s hard to imagine what patents (*not* copyrights) might have been even plausibly infringed. Initial gut reaction is Nintendo may be reaching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What actual patents <em>could</em> Palworld have infringed on? Palworld may have similarities, but as a whole it is a vastly different game to anything Pokémon that has been released so far. Plus, there's been a great many other creature collecting games released before Palworld, and lots of games that also have similar game mechanics to other parts of Palworld so this lawsuit could have a knock-on effect elsewhere if Nintendo win.</p>
<p><em>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve and Gold on ProtonDB.</em></p>

      <title>29 games are getting delisted from GOG</title>

<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> have announced some bad news across two separate announcements, with a total of 29 games that are going to be delisted this month.

</ul>
<p><em>Two of those are bundles of the other games. The article originally said it was 31 in total so updated to correct.</em></p>
<p>For all of those GOG simply said "I can't share any more details about it". That's a pretty abrupt delisting too for the Meridian4 titles, giving only a couple of days notice.</p>
<p>If you've been on the fence about wanting to pick up any of those from GOG, now is the time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>PSA: If our GOG links don't open - blame your plugins. Some browser plugins at some point decided to just auto-close certain affiliate links, the same links we've used for a long time now. They used to give a message asking if you wish to proceed, now some just…don't. You should report the issue to the developer of whatever plugins you're using.</p>

      <title>Valve heads to PAX Australia for the first time, maybe they&#39;ll finally get the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAX Aus have announced their 2024 line-up and it's absolutely packed with big names. Curiously, even Valve for Steam will be attending.</p>
<p>The line-up of exhibitors was <a href="https://aus.paxsite.com/en-us/info/news/2024-exhibitor-line-up.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> yesterday, September 17th, in an official post on the PAX Aus website. It notes that some big brands and companies will be there including Bethesda Softworks ANZ, Blizzard Entertainment, Devolver, FINAL FANTASY XIV Online, PC Game Pass, Playside Studios, SEGA, Steam, The Sims, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Quite exciting to see Steam listed with the event organisers noting "While on the topic of love, PAX Aus welcomes Steam for the first time ever. More on that when the show opens, you’re not going to want to miss it!"</p>
<p>Sounds interesting and they're clearly being a little coy. Pointing perhaps to something exciting coming, and a gaming event would be a good place to announce anything for a company like Valve.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, Australia might <em>finally</em> see a proper Steam Deck release? Even though it's not officially available, that hasn't stopped plenty of stores in Australia letting people buy it via importing it which many people have done so. However, getting it done officially would be awesome for the continued success of Valve's hardware.</p>
<p>Although, it might not be Steam Deck related, who knows, they might even use the time for an official Deadlock launch into a more open Beta without needing invites. Time to keep expectations in check huh?</p>
<p>The event runs from October 11th - 13th October, 2024.</p>

      <title>Funko Fusion to get Steam Deck support sometime post-launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Frame of Mind developer ended up coding the game on Steam Deck for a year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one for you. What do you do when you're a game developer and your laptop dies? Use your Steam Deck to continue developing of course.</p>
<p>While the Steam Deck is a great device for gaming, it's also a full Linux-powered PC too, with a complete desktop mode powered by KDE Plasma. This means it can be used for both work and play, and it's always fun to see how people are using it.</p>
<p>In the case of the upcoming game Frame of Mind - A game of thoughts. (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2515480/Frame_of_Mind__A_game_of_thoughts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>), the developer ended up actually doing a years worth of work on the game using the Steam Deck. As they said in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2515480/announcements/detail/6978979436063296992" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> post on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Spring, I was very excited as I finally got my SteamDeck in the mail. The big day came aaaand ... my Laptop died.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the Steam Deck unironically became my main mobile workstation for about a year, and while I admittedly would not go back to it, it was a lot more usable than you might suspect.<br/>
<br/>
This is why i am also proud to announce: My Game will have FULL Steam Deck Support.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, without much optimization, the game is already running well above the 40FPS target for running games smoothly at the lower display refresh rate and I am pretty sure I will be able to hit the 60FPS mark, hopefully even without any 3D render scaling. But as this is a cozy walking sim, you will likely not notice small stutters anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The game furthermore has full controller support and plays a lot better on the Steam Deck, as especially the touch screen will get a lot of utilization.<br/>
<br/>
Font rendering is being considered, as my game has a lot of text and I put a lot of emphasis on accessibility. This is an area that right now needs more development.<br/>
<br/>
I will also look into using the joypads and the accelerator for input, but do not want to promise anything right now.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not surprised they <em>don't</em> wish to go back to using the Steam Deck like this though, unless you have a proper dock setup or something like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-elecrow-crowview-note-is-a-real-useful-all-in-one-portable-monitor-and-keyboard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Elecrow CrowView Note</a>, the small screen space isn't great for work. But it just shows how versatile the system is.</p>
<p>The game is made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, which has some of the best Linux support available of any game engine.</p>

      <title>Dead by Daylight spin-off Project T has been cancelled, Midwinter Entertainment shut down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Midwinter Entertainment and Behaviour Interactive Inc. were working on Project T, a spin-off from the popular Dead by Daylight but it's now been shelved.</p>
<p>Set in the DBD universe the developers originally described it as: "Project T is a 1–4-person co-op PVE shooter currently in early development. Load your shotgun, ready your truck, and team up to traverse a haunting and dangerous world, facing waves of enemies from the darkest corners of The Entity’s Realm."</p>
<p>However, a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2424380/view/7124220524042684644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> was posted on the Steam page, and the description on the page also removed to mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To our Community,</p>
<p>When we conceptualized this project, we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which led to the creation of this Insiders Program. This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on Project T’s core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game. Following the playtest in July, we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from both a product and commercial perspective. While a number of you expressed appreciation for what you played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results.</p>
<p>It’s with a heavy heart that we announce that Project T has been canceled. We want to thank you for your support throughout this journey.</p>
<p>-The Project T Team</p>

<p>According to people who worked at Midwinter Entertainment, the studio has also been shut down as a result as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by Daniel Alexander, who was Animation &amp; Art Lead at Midwinter Entertainment.

      <title>Wildkeepers Rising is Vampire Survivors merged with Pokemon and I need it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing together two of my favourites genres. Monster catching and survivor-like bullet heaven, Wildkeepers Rising seems like it's going to be awesome. I thought that the idea of Temtem: Swarm sounded good, but Wildkeepers Rising appears to push the idea much further into a bigger game (and with a vastly different style).</p>
<p>Announced today from Lioncode Games who also made Mech Armada released back in 2022.</p>
<p>Wildkeepers Rising will give you the ridiculous over-the-top and ever-increasing power from the survivor-like boom, while also giving you a creature collection of friends to join you in combat. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7NqUf9zQyjU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d4936bef6c34c93abace2ddc1db4237.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7NqUf9zQyjU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet Heaven </strong>| Shred thousands of monsters in bullet heaven runs</li>
<li><strong>Creature Collector</strong> | Discover, tame, and train magical beasts</li>
<li><strong>Runs &amp; Builds</strong> | Create team synergies with different Guardians</li>
<li><strong>Roguelike Runs</strong> | Take runs with different Wildkeepers wielding different weapons</li>
<li><strong>Progression</strong> | Unlock new Guardians and items and make them stronger between runs</li>
<li><strong>RPG Elements</strong> | Discover a rich world of fantasy heroes and magical monsters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’ve seen survivor games adopt some twists since the original recipe<em>, </em>integrating mining, guns, and god boons; <strong><em>Wildkeepers</em></strong><em> </em>further innovates by adding adorable creature collecting and party synergy to the dopamine rush and replayability of games like <em>Vampire Survivors </em>or<em> Death Must Die” </em>– Sergio Garces, Lioncode Games Director.</p>
<p>“I’m combining cues and inspiration from my favorite anime and fantasy titles to make these monsters as fun and whimsical as I can. Classic arcade beat-em-ups are hugely influential on our character roster as well–we’re a small team, so we’re working hard to create a love letter to our influences that inspired us to want to create.” – Lyle Moore, Art Director.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995560/Wildkeepers_Rising/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. I am 100% going to be checking this one out, so I'll let you know how it runs with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Grand Theft Auto V gets BattlEye anti-cheat, breaks online play on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update #1 - 14:31 UTC</strong>: Rockstar have now put up an official <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for BattlEye where they state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is BattlEye compatible with Steam Deck?</p>
<p>Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for GTA Online. You will be able to play GTAV Story Mode but unable to play GTA Online.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GTAV and GTA Online are not officially supported on Steam Deck and all technical support questions should be directed to Valve’s Steam Deck support content and community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still currently waiting for an official statement from Rockstar on any plans to enable it, since BattlEye as mentioned below <em>is</em> supported on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 - 18/09/24, 9:30 UTC</strong>: Rockstar press did not reply, but their support team did. They simply copied the new FAQ entry noted above, and when pushed just told me to use their feedback form and closed up my ticket asking about it. Typical support-level reply.</p>
<p>I've emailed Valve press to see if they have anything they would like to say on the situation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, Rockstar have now added BattlEye anti-cheat to Grand Theft Auto V / GTA Online, and sadly it seems they have not enabled the support for Linux desktop and Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. <em>The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable.</em></p>
<p>When you try to play online, you might stay in for a minute or so but then abruptly you get this and you're kicked:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12685204351726575009gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12685204351726575009gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - my test of GTA V Online on Kubuntu 24.04</em></p>
<p>Hopefully this is just an oversight, since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/battleye-confirms-linux-support-for-steam-deck-will-be-opt-in-like-easy-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye does have Linux platform support</a>. I've reached out to Rockstar in a few places to ask about it, to see if they do plan to enable Proton support for BattlEye.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn't <em>intentionally</em> blocked, let's say they overlooked enabling it, this once again just goes to show that the Steam Deck and Linux gaming have ways to go before bigger developers and publishers actually do some proper testing.</p>
<p>Considering it's one of the most played games on Steam overall, it will be quite a loss if it's intentionally not being enabled. It's also one of the most played games on Steam Deck specifically too, so it would make this banner on the Steam page look a bit silly if it stays broken:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025322641726576091gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The single-player story mode continues to work though.</p>

      <title>Fuse creatures together in NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters - set for launch on September 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing together auto-battling and monster-training into a fun mixture, NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters from DiceHit Games and Rogue Duck Interactive releases on September 30th. It has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Very similar to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/backpack-battles-is-another-clear-indie-steam-hit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Battles</a>, but the monster twist to it seemed interesting from the previous demo I played through for quite a while. Here you have the inventory management side to it but you also have the Cosmions, little monsters you put in your bag that you evolve and fuse to create unique builds to fight with.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xf1LR2mEvhw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0746e8e4147a787e0a4aa2402f1aef20.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xf1LR2mEvhw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters is our ode to the strategy and auto-battling genre. We wanted to create a game where players could experiment with builds, create unique combinations, and play on their own time. The Cosmions add a layer of depth, allowing for a plethora of possibilities in every duel." ​- Bahadır, lead developer at DiceHit Games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Your Dream Team</strong>: Select and place your Cosmions to create powerful synergies and defeat your opponents. After each Duel, choose new Cosmions to enhance your team and aim for the win.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Duelists at Your Own Pace</strong>: Enjoy asynchronous multiplayer gameplay, allowing you to control the pace of the game. Pause and resume at your convenience, with your progress saved and opponents ready for your next move. </li>
<li><strong>Evolve and Fuse Your Cosmions</strong>: Use essences to evolve your Cosmions into their most advanced forms and fuse different monsters to unlock unique and powerful creations.</li>
<li><strong>Climb the Competitive Ranks</strong>: Boost your Elo-ranking by competing against other players and aim for the top in a thrilling, competitive setting.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Different Builds</strong>: Customize your gameplay with unique modifications and upgrades that showcase your style. Explore various tactics and uncover powerful synergies to maximize your backpack’s potential.</li>
</ul>

      <title>LibreQuake aims to create a completely free Quake alternative compatible with mods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a similar spirit to <a href="https://freedoom.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freedoom</a>, for Quake fans perhaps you'll want to take a look at LibreQuake, which aims to do a similar thing.</p>
<p>As they explain best on the <a href="https://github.com/lavenderdotpet/LibreQuake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>LibreQuake</em> project aims to create a complete, free content first-person shooter game, but <em>LibreQuake</em> by itself is just the raw material for a game. It must be paired with a compatible engine to be played.</p>
<p>There is a massive <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back catalogue</a>, spanning over two decades, containing thousands of <em>Quake</em> levels and other modifications (“mods”) made by fans of the game. <em>LibreQuake</em> aims to be compatible with these and allows most to be played without the need to use non-free software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So with LibreQuake, you will be able to play through a bunch of classic Quake content without needing to mess around with the original proprietary Quake content itself. At least that seems to be the plan. You would pair this up with your favourite open source Quake game engine like Quakespasm, Quakespasm-Spiked, vkQuake or whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/340052131726566222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/340052131726566222gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - LibreQuake, credit: LibreQuake team.</em></p>
<p>It's not just about allowing you to play through Quake mods and conversions freely, it's also great for the modders too. They can base their mods on this, instead of the proprietary content from Quake, and have no issues with licensing then and no chance in future of mods being taken down if they're using free software. As the LibreQuake team say: "Most Quake projects are lax on reusing intellectual property".</p>

      <title>Real-time air-traffic management sim &#39;Mini Airways&#39; gets Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mini Airways is a total delight and now it's even better with some extra free maps, plus there's also now Steam Workshop support with a level editor. See also: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/real-time-air-traffic-controller-sim-mini-airways-is-out-now-and-will-keep-you-on-your-toes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my previous thoughts on the game</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? As a reminder: Mini Airways is a real-time management game with an air traffic control theme. You will play as a busy air traffic controller in the game: directing planes to take off and land, clearing air traffic, upgrading airspace ...... And most of all, don't let them crash!</p>
<p>Thanks to the level editor there's already (at time of writing) over 170 maps approved in the Steam Workshop. So once you've finished the main game, perhaps try out some of them?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15503318071726565546gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15503318071726565546gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Plenty more new with this free update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two Unique New Maps:
<ul>
<li>Cheongju Airport, South Korea: Featuring a runway reserved only for emergency landings.</li>
<li>Hamad International Airport, Qatar: Expect occasional extreme weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triple Speed Button: <span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px"> Speed up the early game for quicker progress.</span></li>
<li>Pre-Flight Turning Commands: <span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">You can now issue turn commands to planes on the runway, which will execute after takeoff.</span></li>
<li>Enhanced Collision Alerts (TCAS): <span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px"> Improved visibility for imminent collision warnings.</span></li>
<li>Optional Voice Settings: Customize your experience by turning certain voice prompts on or off.</li>

      <title>Enlisted from Darkflow / Gaijin swapping from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Darkflow Software and Gaijin Network Ltd have announced their multiplayer online shooter Enlisted will be changing the anti-cheat sometime in the coming days.</p>
<p>Announced in a post on Steam, no particular reason was given on <em>why</em> they're dropping Easy Anti-Cheat and going with BattlEye instead. They're two of the most popular anti-cheat systems with game developers with BattlEye being used in games like DayZ, ARK Survival Evolved, Conan Exiles, Fortnite (that also uses EAC too), The Crew 2, Tarkov, Destiny 2 and so on.</p>
<p>What they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2051620/announcements/detail/4594323246560579728?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commanders, in the coming days Enlisted will transition to a new anti-cheat software, BattlEye. With its help, we'll be able to combat forbidden modifications even more effectively!</p>
<p>For honest players, nothing will change, just our old anti-cheat software will simply be replaced by BattlEye!</p>
<p>Advantages of the new anti-cheat</p>
<p>BattlEye already protects dozens of different multiplayer shooters. It will be very useful in Enlisted too! It effectively fights against unfair play, working on both server and client side, constantly checking for interference in the game processes. Thus, most hacks are completely blocked from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Everything will happen automatically!</p>
<p>Replacing the protection system will take a little time and will occur during one of the launches of the Enlisted client. Afterwards, you'll be greeted by a new protection system window at the start of the game.</p>
<p>BattlEye will only work while the Enlisted client is running and will not affect your system's performance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6653538391726493800gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Enlisted has a Native Linux version and is rated Steam Deck Playable, with the verification by Valve done using their Native Linux version too. So with that in mind, it should be fine, especially since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/battleye-confirms-linux-support-for-steam-deck-will-be-opt-in-like-easy-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye does have Linux support</a>. However, as with any anti-cheat change, some issues may pop up which hopefully they will fix soon if there are any.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enlisted on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3 is a big powerful desktop-replacement class laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who have the need for something somewhat portable, with a lot of power, perhaps the TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3 will be your next purchase. TUXEDO are saying this is a desktop replacement workstation, so if you're looking for something small and light this definitely isn't it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/267810411726490164gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/267810411726490164gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The base configuration of the units comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen: WQHD (2560 x 1440) IPS matt | 240 Hz | 99% sRGB.</li>
<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX (16 Cores | 32 Threads | Max Boost 5.4 GHz | 85 W TDP).</li>
<li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 8GB.</li>
<li>RAM: 16 GB (2x 8GB) DDR5 5600MHz Crucial.</li>
<li>Storage: 500 GB Samsung 980 (NVMe PCIe 3.0).</li>
<li>Keyboard: Backlit with TUX super-key.</li>
<li>Connectivity: Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210 (802.11ax | 2.4, 5 &amp; 6 GHz | Bluetooth 5.3).</li>
<li>Battery: 73 Wh battery.</li>
<li>Operating System: TUXEDO OS, Ubuntu or Kubuntu (Windows 11 costs extra).</li>
<li>2 years warranty (Incl. parts, labour &amp; shipping)</li>
</ul>
<p>A slightly eye-watering price at 1699 EUR (includes tax if you're in Germany) and 1427 EUR for customers outside Europe (excluding tax). You can configure it higher too with up to 64GB RAM, NVIDIA 4070 and up to 2 x 4TB storage.</p>
<p>Plenty of ports including USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (5 Gbit/s), 2-in-1 audio jack (mic-in, headphone-out), USB-A 3.2 Gen2 (10 Gbit/s), USB-C 3.2 Gen2 (Hardwired to: iGPU | NO DisplayPort 1.4a | PowerDelivery DC-In | DC-Out: max. 15 Watt (5 V / 3 A)), Mini DisplayPort 1.4 (Hardwired to: dGPU | G-SYNC compatible), RJ45 1 Gbit LAN, HDMI 2.1 (Hardwired to: dGPU | G-SYNC | HDCP 2.3), Power plug (DC-In) and USB-C 3.2 Gen2 (Hardwired to: iGPU | DisplayPort 1.4a | <u>NO</u> PowerDelivery DC-In | DC-Out: max. 15 Watt (5 V / 3 A)).</p>
<p>I've no doubt some will think "what's the point, it's huge, buy a desktop!", but carrying around a monitor and tower aren't exactly realistic. For people who <em>need</em> the power <em>and</em> the portability of throwing it in a suitable bag, it's useful and with those high specs, it will last quite a long time to come.</p>
<p>Shipping for it begins mid-October.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 1 emulator DuckStation changes license for no commercial use and no derivatives</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a bit of a furore in the emulation community lately centred around the PlayStation 1 emulator <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DuckStation</a>, which has now seen two license changes recently. As far as I'm aware, DuckStation is the most popular emulator for Sony's classic PS1 console, due to it being fast and accurate.</p>
<p>Up until recently it was open source under the GPL, then on <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/commit/9ca6b5430fb358b39f21ce0b2fc0268de954dd23" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 1st</a> it changed over to the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/strict/1.0.0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PolyForm Strict License</a>, and then again on <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/commit/76906756d0b5f93ac2559c29676cbea11496a21a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 13th</a> it was changed over to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CC-BY-NC-ND license</a>. This places a number of restrictions on the project like no commercial use and no derivatives allowed. That means, according to the creator, that no one else is allowed to package it up either as their change mentioned "Packaging is still **not** permitted, since it is effectively a modified/derived work".</p>
<p>Replying to a user unhappy about it on the GitHub, the creator <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/pull/3295#issuecomment-2348988362" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am well aware of how licenses work. That's why I changed, to make it very clear and a deterrent due to certain parties violating the old license, by not attributing and stripping my copyright. Packagers being collateral damage was a beneficial side-effect, considering they don't clearly mark their versions as modified (also a GPL requirement), break functionality, and expect upstream to provide support.</p>
<p>I have the approval of prior contributors, and if I did somehow miss you, then please advise me so I can rewrite that code. I didn't spend several weekends rewriting various parts for no reason. I do not have, nor want a CLA, because I do not agree with taking away contributor's copyright.</p>
<p>Also, I don't appreciate the threats. If you are not a copyright holder, then you <strong>are not in a position to make any demands.</strong> I find it especially ironic, considering when the GPL was actually violated on multiple occasions, even as recently as a few months ago, nobody ever takes issue with that.</p>
<p>I've restricted the repository to prior contributors, and if they have any concerns, they are more than welcome to do so here. If this turns into harassment, then I'll just shut the whole thing down, because I'm way too busy with my actual job to be dealing with unsubstantiated drama from a hobby that is supposed to be fun. Please consider how the community would benefit from that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, this means DuckStation as of the latest changes is no longer open source. You could say it's "source available", or <em>whatever</em> your chosen way is to describe code you can view but has restrictions on it.</p>

<p>This all started from Valve attempting to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deal with the publisher spam problem</a>. Where certain publishers would dump game after game in a list on some of their store pages, before you even got to the description of what the game actually is you're currently viewing. Basically they were using some store pages as an advert for another game. It became a real nuisance and Valve banned it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-tweak-steam-pages-again-giving-developers-some-more-options-while-dealing-with-the-mess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">More tweaks came in late August </a>giving developers extra control over the "more from" and DLC lists, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4592070813172257798" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this latest update</a> adds in additional options along with delaying all the new rules until October 15th to give developers more time to adjust store pages.</p>
<p>The first new feature is bundle pinning, so developers can put bundles on store pages in whatever order they actually want. By default though, Valve has said the order is based on "recent revenue generated by purchases of that bundle" as they see it as a reasonable default. Since games can be in any number of bundles, only 3 are displayed, so this way developers can pin what they want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1735218791726484998gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve also expanded what social media links are allowed in the sidebar on store pages to include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>QQ</li>
<li>VK (VKontakte)</li>
<li>Bilibili</li>
<li>Weibo</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Baidu Tieba</li>
<li>Tiktok</li>
<li>Telegram</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We're all confused (including Valve) on why LinkedIn is in the list, but developers are using it.</em></p>
<p>Another change is to the "more from" list at the bottom of store pages. Now developers can choose to include games from <em>any</em> entities listed as a developer or publisher for a game (as there can be multiple in both). On top of that, the more than section can now have a special item pinned bigger to the front of the list taking up the space of two items and have buttons for add to cart / wishlist.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4936514791726484731gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Lastly, there's some tweaks to the DLC list too so developers can list DLC dependencies, where one DLC needs to be owned for another, which according to Valve doesn't happen all that much but purchasers of course need to know this. Developers can also now re-order the DLC list a little easier.</p>

      <title>An interview with the creator of Lutris</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to learn a little more about <a href="https://lutris.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lutris</a>, the popular Linux app for managing games, emulators and much more? Here's your chance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> like with the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/an-interview-with-the-developers-of-the-heroic-games-launcher/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher interview</a> this was originally posted on Reddit, with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flwwhtrbt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">user</a> sending it over to GamingOnLinux for republishing. We're just providing a space here for more people to see it and learn more. Also, if you didn't see recently, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-creator-of-lutris-has-joined-up-with-playtron-for-playtronos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">creator of Lutris recently joined Playtron</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the interview:</p>
<h4>Introduction and Background</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q1: Can you tell us a bit about yourself, Lutris and how it got started? I see that you initially made Oblivion Launcher, so this has clearly been your passion for a long time. What sparked you to jump from that to Lutris?</h5>
<p><strong>Mathieu Comandon</strong>: "I had recently switched to Linux as my main OS, after using it on secondary machines for a while. I still wanted to play my games but at the time, it meant reading tutorials that would get outdated really fast or only worked on one distro. Getting games to run on Linux could become a very frustrating experience at times but it seemed that this could be considerably improved."</p>
<h5>Q2: In a more broad sense, what was the inspiration behind creating Lutris?</h5>
<p>"Around that time I was using Cedega, a proprietary fork of Wine with a nice GUI. I wanted something similar but open source but I didn't want to limit myself to Wine games like Cedega or PlayOnLinux did. I wanted support for all games that could run on Linux, which included native games and emulators."</p>
<h5>Q3: Can you give us a brief overview of your team's background and how you came together to develop it?</h5>
<p>"These days, the team is mostly Daniel Johnson, who does an enormous amount of user support on <a href="https://github.com/lutris" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a> and GloriousEggroll who provides builds for Proton-GE. Then there's the Open Wine Components project that encompasses other gaming projects and regular contributors on Github.<br/>
There's also a very active moderation team on the Discord server.<br/>
There's no fixed team structure, anyone can just come and go, do their own thing."</p>
<h5>Q4: How has Lutris itself evolved since its initial release?</h5>
<p>"15 years ago, gaming on Linux was very experimental. With the evolution that happened in the past years, it's now something we have integrated in our lives. Games running on Linux is now the norm. So instead of tinkering, we can shift our focus on making sure games keep running in the years to come, particularly games that are no longer being sold."</p>
<h5>Tell me about your logo for Lutris!</h5>
<p>"The initial logo (the version with the Atari joystick) was designed by a friend of mine at the time and later received some updates to make it more readable at small sizes. It was always meant to take inspiration from Mozilla's logos. A lot of projects have an animal as their logo: PHP, Postgres, Firefox... so I wanted my own animal mascot. I picked the otter because it's an animal that likes to play!"</p>
<h4>Features and Functionality</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q5: What are the key features that set Lutris apart from other game launchers? There is a few now who offer similar capabilities, what makes Lutris so unique?</h5>
<p>"Lutris is the only launcher on Linux to support such a wide array of games from all platforms. Most launchers focus on Wine but Wine is only one of the 54 runners we currently support. The idea is to be able to build a collection of all the games you have played during your lifetime, easily accessible and playable."</p>
<h5>Q6: How does Lutris integrate with Steam, especially on the Steam Deck?</h5>
<p>"The Steam integration is much more basic now than it once was when we used to run Steam in Wine. Running Steam games from Lutris only calls Steam with the correct Steam ID, the options in Lutris don't apply to the Steam game. For the Steam Deck, it's the opposite: Running Lutris games in Steam. We have a feature for creating shortcuts for Lutris games in the Steam UI. In the next release of Lutris, we'll also have better support for running games with umu on the Steam Deck (it makes it possible to use Proton instead of Wine)."</p>
<h5>Q7: Could you explain how Lutris handles the management and optimization of non-native games?</h5>
<p>"We call runner any program that can launch games, native games being the only games that don't require one. We provide binaries for those runners, which get updated on a more or less regular basis. The important is not using the latest version but having a version that can run games really well. For example, we ship DOSBox Staging to provide a better experience for DOS games. Wine / Proton is the only runner that receives some patching."</p>
<h5>Q8: What features do you think are the most underappreciated by users?</h5>
<p>"Certainly the collection management and non Wine games aspects. I often see people with less than 10 games on Lutris and all mostly Wine based. On my end, I have over 1300 installed games for a variety of platforms. Sadly, the fact that people have switched from HDDs to SSDs doesn't help building a large video game collection."</p>
<h4>Development and Community</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q9: How do you prioritize and manage feature requests and bug reports from the community? I see you have such a sizable community built up around you (which speaks volumes to your skills as a programmer), can you describe what goes into prioritizing bugs or features?</h5>
<p>"If something is broken and impacts significantly the usage of Lutris then that gets the highest priority. Then comes the pull requests submitted by contributors. Bugs that can't be reproduced or features that would only interest a small portion of users get the lowest priority."</p>
<h5>Q10: Can you share any interesting stories or challenges you faced during the development of Lutris?</h5>
<p>"Between 2011 and 2012, the development of Lutris had crawled almost to a halt because of a game called Minecraft.<br/>
At numerous times, maintaining the project felt very overwhelming and it was often difficult to deal with that. I often resorted to measures that were more or less clumsy but however gave me some breathing space (for a few months, reporting issues was only allowed to previous contributors, for example). Nowadays, managing the project is much easier. I put less pressure on myself to try and micro-manage everything and I get some precious help from the community to help me with Github."</p>
<h5>Q11: How important has community feedback been in shaping Lutris? Can you give an example of a community-driven feature that you ended up implementing?</h5>
<p>"The community has a tendency to push for the adoption of newer technologies while I have a tendency to hold back a bit before we adopt anything new. Some people use lutris on quite outdated systems and we try not breaking anything until a distribution gets really old. Finding the right balance is quite an art but the community helps in knowing what is needed and which systems can be dropped.</p>
<p>Also, a few runners we have were entirely written by community members. Translations are another aspect that is heavily driven by the community."</p>
<h5>Q12: How do you foster a positive and engaged community around Lutris? Your discord in particular are so positive about your product, how do you encourage your users to participate and contribute </h5>
<p>"I don't have the time to do much on Discord but there is an amazing moderation team. Troublemakers are kicked out really fast which keeps the vibe on the server positive. Personally, I tend to engage more with the community on Github and Mastodon."</p>
<h4>Technical Aspects</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q13: What technologies and programming languages is Lutris built on?</h5>
<p>"The desktop client is using Gtk 3, the website uses Django. Both are written in Python. We also have a moderation dashboard written in VueJS."</p>
<h5>Q14: Can you discuss the challenges and solutions in ensuring compatibility across various Linux distributions?</h5>
<p>"We've been shipping a set of libraries with Lutris trying to increase compatibility across distros. This isn't a perfect solution but works for the most part. This is the approach Steam used to have. Now, similarly to Steam, we are transitioning to a container based approach, whether it's pressure vessel with umu or Flatpak."</p>
<h5>Q15: How do you approach optimizing performance for different hardware configurations, especially for the Steam Deck?</h5>
<p>"We don't really have anything in place that target specific devices. We do however provide many option to let users find the best possible setting for their games."</p>
<h5>Q16: How do you handle the rapid changes and updates, do the Steam Deck's updates ever affect what you do?</h5>
<p>"There are some breakages once in a while but so far the Steam Deck with its immutable OS has been pretty stable. We're still working on providing support for using Proton on the Deck's game mode but it's coming soon."</p>
<h4>Future Plans</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q17: What are your short-term and long-term goals for Lutris?</h5>
<p>"Short term is the release of Lutris 0.5.18. It will contain all the fixes and improvements made during the past few months, but nothing really groundbreaking. In the longer term, we're going to start working on a "Big picture mode" (integration with OpenGamepadUI) and cloud saves."</p>
<h5>Q18: Are there any upcoming features or improvements you’re particularly excited about?</h5>
<p>"The 2 I mentioned earlier, cloud saves and fullscreen UI are very important. We also need a better rating system and better support for Flatpak (by making the Lutris Flatpak very thin and using other Flatpaks to run games)"</p>
<h5>Q19: How do you see Lutris evolving with the advancements in gaming technology and hardware?</h5>
<p>"That mostly depends on upstream projects like Gamescope, VKD3D, Mesa or Plasma. We used to lack a lot of features of newer hardware like HDR or ray tracing. Now, we have pretty much every feature used in games like DLSS, FSR3, HDR, etc... Now, we're only lacking in anti-cheat support."</p>
<h5>Q20: What is your vision for the future of gaming on Linux?</h5>
<p>"Projects like the Steam Deck and Playtron are going to help push gaming on Linux outside of the Linux community and make it available to a wider audience. Maybe we'll finally see game consoles for the TV using Linux. The new trend of handhelds is nice but it's not the best way to experience games with graphics pushed to their highest settings."</p>
<h4>Community and Support</h4>
<hr/>
<h5>Q21: What are the best ways for users to get involved with the Lutris community?</h5>
<p>"Easiest way is to join the Discord server. That's where most of the non-development stuff happens. We might get a bridged Matrix room at some point too."</p>
<h5>Q22: How can users contribute to the development or support of Lutris?</h5>
<p>"For development, we have a list of open tickets on Github, and if someone wants to implement something new, I recommend creating a ticket if one doesn't exist. Sometimes, some contributors send a patch which doesn't fit the project and we don't merge it. We want to avoid that kind of situation, especially for substantial patches.<br/>
Supporting the project financially is very much appreciated. There are Patreon, Paypal and Liberapay Lutris accounts that can be used for donations. We don't accept cryptocurrency though."</p>
<h5>Q23: What resources do you offer for new users to get started with Lutris?</h5>
<p>"The goal for Lutris is to not require any ressources to get started so if anything is missing or unclear, report it as a bug."</p>
<h5>Q24: How do you address user support and ensure issues are resolved efficiently?</h5>
<p>"In a lot of user support for Lutris means troubleshooting generic Linux issues. That's we have both a Lutris Support and Linux Support channels in our Discord server. Usually, when something is broken in Lutris, we'll start getting multiple reports for it and we prioritize those issues first."</p>
<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
<hr/>
<h5>Q25: What advice would you give to aspiring developers who want to create their own game launchers or similar tools?</h5>
<p>"Build a very small project that solves a real and specific issue you have and try to make it work. If it solves your problem, it may continue evolving into something bigger."</p>
<h5>Q26: Is there anything else you’d like to share with our readers about Lutris or your team?</h5>
<p>"When I started working on Lutris, I had no idea it would reach this size. I initially imagined it would mostly be picked up by the community and I would focus on other project. But then Linux gaming got really big (Vulkan happened) and with it Lutris got bigger too and at this point it was clear no one was going to take over. Lutris was becoming a recognized open source project and I was invited to events like WineConf and Ubuntu Summit. After a lot of perceverance, it really paid off!"</p>
<h5>Q27: What has been the most rewarding aspect of developing Lutris for you personally?</h5>
<p>"It has been an excellent learning experience in plenty of fields. And it has certainly helped me get jobs more easily. But the best reward is Lutris itself. Being able to manage a large library of games spreading over decades and multiple systems."</p>

      <title>4A Games and Zen Studios staying with Embracer Group</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/saber-interactive-splits-off-from-embracer-group-taking-various-studios-with-them/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in March</a> there was the report that Saber Interactive split off from Embracer Group, with them potentially taking on 4A Games and Zen Studios.</p>
<p>Saber already took quite a few studios with them including Nimble Giant, 3D Realms, Slipgate, New World Interactive and various others but we didn't know what was going to happen with the Metro series creator 4A Games and the Pinball FX team Zen Studios.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-receives-early-payment-for-sale-of-saber-assets-4a-games-and-zen-studios-will-remain-within-embracer-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> update about the sale of Saber Interactive, Embracer Group have confirmed the "cancellation of the option for the buyer to acquire 4A Games and Zen Studios" along with an early payment from the sale.</p>

<p>“We are satisfied with the conclusion of this transaction and very glad to see the great teams and assets of 4A Games and Zen Studios remain within Embracer. They will be important building blocks in our continued journey. 4A Games has currently two AAA titles under development that we eagerly await to announce. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Matthew Karch for his contributions over the years, and at the same time congratulate the Saber team on the successful release of the iconic Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, that will make a great start in their new structure” says Lars Wingefors, co-founder and CEO of Embracer.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.11 is officially out now </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the final release of the Linux kernel 6.11, as usual with a ridiculous amount of improvements, fixes, support for new and future hardware releases and everything in between.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/9/15/282" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> here's what Linus Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm once again on the road and not in my normal timezone, but it's Sunday afternoon here in Vienna, and 6.11 is out.</p>
<p>The last week was actually pretty quiet and calm, which is nice to see. The shortlog is below for anybody who wants to look at the details, but it really isn't very many patches, and the patches are all pretty small. Nothing in particular stands out - the biggest patch in here is for Hyper-V Confidential Computing documentation.</p>
<p>Anyway, with this, the merge window will obviously open tomorrow, and I already have 40+ pull requests pending. That said, exactly _because_ I'm on the road, it will probably be a fairly slow start to the merge window, since not only am I on my laptop, there's OSS Europe starting tomorrow and then the kernel maintainer summit on Tuesday. So if I don't get to your pull request immediately, please be patient.</p>
<p>But before that merge window activity, please do give the latest release a try!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going over the full list of changes some quick highlights for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements for ROG Ally X support.</li>
<li>Lots of work for Intel Xe2 graphics support.</li>
<li>More AMD RDNA4 GPU enabling work.</li>
<li>An EXT4 filesystem optimization with "improving IOPS and throughput on fast devices running Async Direct I/O by up to 20%".</li>
<li>More control over swappiness behaviour.</li>
<li>Improvements for Snapdragon X1 Elite support including the Asus Vivobook S15 and the Lenovo Yoga Slim7x.</li>
<li>Fixes for Asus ROG 2024 laptops using CS35L41 audio support.</li>
<li>Further improvements for Framework Laptops, including their Chromebook Edition.</li>
<li>Added support for magic keyboard backlight on T2 Macs.</li>
<li>Added a DMI orientation quirk for the OrangePi Neo Linux Gaming Handheld.</li>
<li>Asus Zenbook Duo improvements for connecting / removing the keyboard.</li>
<li>Better support for the Orange Pi 3B.</li>
<li>An interesting change I spotted was to "Optimise psi_group_change a bit" from developer Tvrtko Ursulin, where they noted:
<ul>
<li>"The benefit is both in the code size and CPU time spent in this function. YMMV but on my Steam Deck, while in a game, the patch makes the CPU usage go from ~2.4% down to ~1.2%. Text size at the same time went from 0x323 to 0x2c1."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just searching through and cherry-picking random bits here. It's a ridiculously long read. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a particular change you're excited to see that made it into Linux kernel 6.11? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Windows kernel changes don&#39;t suddenly mean big things for Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of blog posts and news articles being written right now centred around Microsoft's plans for updates to Windows 11, and potential kernel changes, with some thinking this means big things for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but I'm here to bring a more realistic take and to help keep all your feet on the ground.</p>
<p>This comes from a Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/09/12/taking-steps-that-drive-resiliency-and-security-for-windows-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> titled "Taking steps that drive resiliency and security for Windows customers", which is as a result of the recent CrowdStrike incident where an update took down millions of Windows PCs due to it running at the kernel-level inside Windows.</p>
<p>One that has been really doing the rounds lately, especially across Reddit and other social media is from <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-paves-the-way-for-Linux-gaming-success-with-plan-that-would-kill-kernel-level-anti-cheat.888345.0.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>, with a rather sensational article title of "Microsoft paves the way for Linux gaming success with plan that would kill kernel-level anti-cheat".</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Microsoft <em>don't</em> actually say they will kill off kernel-level access, and <em>if</em> they tried that (again - they tried with Vista before), they will no doubt again face some pretty serious push-back from both cybersecurity vendors and regulators across various countries. Something that would likely be more hassle than its actually worth. What Microsoft <em>do</em> actually talk about, is providing <em>additional</em> options that are outside of kernel mode - a whole <em>new</em> platform to "meet the needs of security vendors".</p>
<p>This new security platform, if vendors chose to actually go ahead and use it, could mean the <em>opposite</em> for Linux gaming, and cause a whole bunch of new <em>headaches</em> when it comes to supporting it regardless of it being via Native Linux games, or Windows games through Wine and Proton. So if anything, I would say that rather than paving the way for Linux gaming to get better, it's just going to be <em>another</em> hurdle. As annoying as that is.</p>
<p>Just because some things may move out of the kernel-level, also doesn't mean things will suddenly work on Linux (or get any easier to support via Wine / Proton). There will be <em>various</em> ways for developers to detect Linux, and continue to block it.</p>
<p>Just look at Destiny 2 as the easy and simple example here, they very clearly check for and completely block Linux platforms from playing Destiny 2 via Proton with no way around it. From the official Bungie <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049024592-Destiny-2-Steam-Guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck and Destiny 2</strong></p>
<p>Destiny 2 is not supported for play on the Steam Deck or on any system utilizing Steam Play's Proton unless Windows is installed and running. Players who attempt to launch Destiny 2 on the Steam Deck through SteamOS or Proton will be unable to enter the game and will be returned to their game library after a short time.</p>
<p>Players who are not accessing Destiny 2 through Windows and attempt to bypass the SteamOS/Proton incompatibility will be met with a game ban.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You could expect to see more of that.</em></p>
<p>Then there's another easy example, Rust from Facepunch. Garry Newman has been pretty outspoken in the past about it, and how when they last had Rust supported on Linux, another Facepunch developer noted it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/facepunch-put-out-a-fresh-statement-on-rust-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">caused more cheating</a> issues for them to have to deal with.</p>
<p>How about Fortnite? That's pretty much a "lol no" event too, it's not like things being client-side will suddenly mean Fortnite would work on Linux, it would absolutely continue to be blocked. At least, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not until Linux / Steam Deck has tens of millions of users</a> according to Epic's Tim Sweeney.</p>
<p>Roblox is an additional easy example here to really make the point. Their latest anti-cheat is not kernel level, and completely blocks Linux. Something doesn't need to be in the kernel to block Linux-based systems. This caused <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/sober-is-a-new-way-to-play-roblox-on-linux-from-the-vinegar-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">projects like Sober</a> to appear to run the Android version.</p>
<p>There's really no easy answer to the anti-cheat problem for Linux / Steam Deck gaming right now, aside from perhaps developers having things done server-side where the platform you're playing on is less of an issue, or cloud gaming where the game isn't even on your machine. That's not to say it will be a problem that will never be solved, just don't expect changes to the way Windows handles things like security, anti-tamper, anti-cheat and so on to be in any way beneficial for Linux.</p>
<p>As usual, over to you in the comments: what are you thinking?</p>

      <title>European Consumer Organization goes after multiple publishers for their in-game currency</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>European Consumer Organization (BEUC) has called on the European Commission to deal with various game publishers, that the BEUC claim are breaching EU consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>The action named "<a href="https://www.beuc.eu/game-over" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game OVER</a>", was announced September 12th, in partnership with member organisations from 17 countries. Taking aim at Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Mojang Studios, Roblox Corporation, Supercell and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>What's the issue then? They identified these areas of concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumers cannot see the real cost of digital items, leading to overspending:</strong> the lack of price transparency of premium in-game currencies and the need to buy extra currency in bundles pushes consumers to spend more. </li>
<li><strong>Companies’ claims that gamers prefer in-game premium currencies are wrong. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Consumers are often denied their rights when using premium in-game currencie</strong>s, tied to unfair terms favouring game developers. </li>
<li><strong>Children are even more vulnerable to these manipulative tactics</strong>. Data shows that children in Europe are spending on average €39 per month on in-game purchases. While they are among the ones playing the most, they have limited financial literacy and are easily swayed by virtual currencies. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>: Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, commented:</p>
<p>"The online world brings new challenges for consumer protection, and it shouldn’t be a place where companies bend the rules to increase profits. BEUC’s members have identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money. Regulators must act, making it clear that even though the gaming world is virtual, it still needs to abide by real-world rules.”</p>
<p>“Gamers shouldn’t need to rely on a calculator anytime they want to make an informed decision on how much they want to spend. The money they spend should be displayed in real money and deceptive practices must be stopped.”</p>
<p>“Today, premium in-game currencies are purposefully tricking consumers and take a big toll on children. Companies are well aware of children’s vulnerability and use tricks to lure younger consumers into spending more.”</p>
<p>Video Games Europe, a trade body that represents 19 European and international video game companies and 13 national trade associations put out their own <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/video-games-europe-statement-on-in-game-currencies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> statement on it that notes:</p>
<p>"The purchase of in-game currencies is a well-established practice, and well understood by players. Our members always respect European consumer laws in how they offer these purchases.</p>
<p>Our industry offers a wide range of games that enable players to access a huge variety of genres and innovative new experiences across different services. Players can experience entire games without spending any money, giving them the opportunity to try games without any upfront cost or commitment.</p>
<p>Video Games Europe and its members support and promote fair and transparent principles for purchases of in-game content, including for in-game currency. The PEGI Code of Conduct requires developers to ensure that the real-world cost is clear and unambiguous at the point of purchase of the in-game currency."</p>
<p>This is going to be an interesting fight. </p>

      <title>WINCH IT OUT is a challenging physics-based driving-platformer like classic Flash games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer ARASLANIX are working on WINCH IT OUT, a physics-based driving-platformer, a game that reminds me of a simpler time with lots of different Flash games.</p>
<p>You've no doubt played lots and lots of platformers, but what about a platformer where you're a car? Some oldies may remember the classic stunt bike Flash games, well this thoroughly reminded me of it, only a fair bit more modern and also quite a bit trickier. The developer was directly inspired by the old Flash lot too, mentioning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a big fan of physics-based driving games, Mudrunner, Trials, and the old motocross games from the Flash era (good old times!) I've been waiting to see more games in this genre. So I decided to create one myself with that Weighty and Off-Roady feeling I’ve been craving. Hope it fills the gap for you too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, nostalgia trip out of the way. What the heck is this then?</p>
<p>The developer said "If you're tired of the same old Gas-and-Go 2D driving games and want a more challenging experience, this one's for you". You drive through Deserts, Forests, Mountains, Dungeons, and more with each biome having its own unique physics-based challenges and it's pretty tricky.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="74fDAS3b14k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/362c9f392e753d99b816e3b45ee99f04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/74fDAS3b14k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes it interesting is how you have manual control of the gears so you have full control over the speed and power, which you'll need to constantly shift about. Then there's the key with the name of the game, the winch you'll need to make great use of too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual Transmission: Full control over Power and Speed using a Manual Gear Shifter.</li>
<li>Unique Abilities: Each Car comes with a special set of abilities designed to solve specific challenges. From your trusty Winch to Boost, Dash, Chain, Glide and everything in between!</li>
<li>Grounded: There are No Backflips and you can't rotate the car in the air because it's weird!</li>
<li>Various Biomes: Deserts , Forests , Mountains, Dungeons, and more.. Each has its own set of physics-based challenges that will test your skills (and nerves!) to the max.</li>
<li>Challenging: You’ll need to think and strategize to navigate each terrain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested? You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956360/WINCH_IT_OUT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is due to release in October. There's also a demo currently available.</p>

      <title>Get drilling for oil once again in the Turmoil - Deeper Underground DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow, haven't heard of this one for a while. Released back in 2016, Turmoil is a game about drilling for oil like it's 1899 and it has a new expansion available. In case you missed it, our contributor BTRE <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/04/drilling-wells-and-selling-oil-some-thoughts-on-turmoil-and-its-dlc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reviewed the original game and the first DLC back in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Turmoil offers players a visually charming, tongue-in-cheek take on the simulation genre inspired by the 19th century oil rush in North America. Get a taste of the rush and rivalry of the time as you earn your way to become a successful oil entrepreneur. As you make money digging up and selling oil, the town will grow along with you."</p>
<p>A popular game still to this day with it regularly seeing hundreds of players, and this new DLC has given it a huge boost with a concurrent peak player count of 3,702 people in the last 24 hours which is closing in on its all-time record. The game also has a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 10,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>Check out the new DLC trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hc3MAutSiGs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/853ae69d61510293ba461dc2fa9821df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hc3MAutSiGs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Creative Director Jos Bouman said: "Creating this new DLC was not planned, but interesting ideas just popped into our heads. A few experiments validated the juiciness and fast forward two years later: Deeper Underground is here!"</p>
<p>What to expect from Deeper Underground:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An all-new town with new buildings, a new mayor, and balloon trips to special deep-drilling grounds!</li>
<li>Besides oil, you can now also find water underground - which comes in handy when you want to drill faster and cheaper! But it's also essential for the production of the highly valuable petrol!</li>
<li>Petrol marks the start of a new era. You can’t just dig it up and sell it right away, you first have to produce it in refineries. It’s a challenging but rewarding undertaking, and we trust there will be no complaints about the revenues it generates!</li>
<li>A brand new expedition: Every few in-game years, regular drilling levels are alternated with special research missions. Here, it's all about trying to drill as deep as possible with limited resources. Can you drill deeper than your opponents?</li>
<li>Two new playable characters to choose from: meet Thorpe and Mabel! Both willing and able!</li>
<li>To get your drilling operation up and running as quickly as possible, meet Yvonne, Sanjay, and Dynamite Dale who will introduce you to their new wares! And of course your old friends Edward, Raynor, Fred, and William will stop by with their train to provide you with all the drilling equipment you need.</li>
<li>Philip is also back, and he's got a new game for you: Dice Dice Dice. If you can outsmart him, you're sure to make a few extra bucks on the side.</li>
<li>Just like previous campaigns, it's all about who has the most town shares in the end. Deeper Underground uses the same bidding system as in the multiplayer campaign, but shares can also be earned in the deep-drilling missions.</li>
<li>And last but not least: we've added an explosive item to the game, dynamite! While hard rock can be nice when it comes out of speakers, it's a big problem when you stumble upon it underground. Normal drills are not strong enough, so make sure to visit Dynamite Dale in the Saloon!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.10 gets a new Snap feature to handle prompting for app permissions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical are continuing to advance their own Snap packaging system, with the Ubuntu 24.10 development builds getting a new permission prompt feature.</p>
<p>Detailed in a Discourse <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-part-5-introducing-permissions-prompting/47963/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post</a> from Canonical's Oliver Smith, the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, it goes over the idea behind this new security feature that has been multiple-years in the making. As Smith explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Permissions prompting is a critical tool for privacy and security conscious users to control, manage and understand the behaviour of applications running on their machine. This implementation represents a significant step forward in application security, and distinguishes itself from traditional XDG Desktop Portals by enabling fine-grained access control over unmodified binaries without requiring changes to the application code. By leveraging Ubuntu’s AppArmor implementation, prompting enforces sandboxing and mediates access at the system call level to ensure that every action is tightly controlled and subject to user consent, even for applications that are entirely unaware of this mediation.</p>
<p>The snapd, security and desktop teams at Canonical have collaborated closely over a number of years to bring this feature to life and we’re excited to deliver an initial opt-in implementation to Ubuntu 24.10 focussed on home interface permissions so that we can refine the experience based on your feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may end up looking something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17444687161726240296gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17444687161726240296gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I like the idea of security prompts, but it does make me think: when is putting all this on the user too much? Prompt fatigue is a very real thing, and people end up ignoring them a lot. Is there any better way though? Likely not, giving the users ultimate control on what apps do is good.</p>
<p>They have plenty of work still to do on it, which is why it won't yet be enabled by default. Some of what they plan to improve over the next few releases include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better default response suggestions based on user feedback.</li>
<li>Shell integration of the prompting pop-ups (eg full screen takeovers)</li>
<li>Improved rule management summaries and better messaging of overlapping or redundant prompts.</li>
<li>Expansion of the prompting system to cover additional snap interfaces such as camera and microphone access.</li>
<li>Smarter client side analysis of prompts, recommending additional options if multiple similar prompts are detected.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve puts two Steam Deck LCD models on sale for Steam&#39;s birthday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's Steam's birthday? Wow, I forgot, did you? To celebrate a little bit, Valve are giving you the chance to give them even more money by picking up a cheap Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The models that are being phased-out have been discounted until September 26th so you can grab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck LCD 64GB with 15% off.</li>
<li>Steam Deck LCD 512GB with 25% off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course that's only while stocks last, and they're likely quite limited and will probably sell-out reasonably quickly, which they have done before. So if you've been really on the fence, this is your best chance. The 64GB paired up with a SSD upgrade is always a great choice. Although for the convenience of 512GB and the anti-glare screen, the higher model is a <em>ridiculously</em> good price with the sale.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4619787351726161796gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>See the sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam Deck store</a>.</p>
<p>21 years of Steam huh? Wow. What's your favourite Steam related memory? Mine is obviously Steam coming to Linux, and trying to get it all working. What a wild ride.</p>

      <title>Unity cancels the stupid Runtime Fee</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a complete disaster a while ago that saw many developers jump-ship, and cause a huge PR problem, Unity have now <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancelled</a> the Runtime Fee.</p>
<p>Instead, they're reverting back to the seat-based subscription model for gaming customers, however they said "Non-gaming Industry customers are not impacted by this modification". This applies to everyone using Unity for gaming, even those that choose to upgrade to Unity 6.</p>
<p>In the post written by Matt Bromberg, the President and CEO of Unity, they mentioned they will go with a "more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis" and that "if we change the Editor software terms in ways that impact you, you may continue using your current version of the software under the previously agreed terms". Hopefully they actually keep to that properly this time.</p>
<p>What the plans will look like now:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Personal: </strong>As announced last year, Unity Personal<strong> </strong>will remain free, and we’ll be doubling the current revenue and funding ceiling from $100,000 to $200,000 USD. This means more of you can use Unity at no cost. The Made with Unity splash screen will become optional for Unity Personal games made with Unity 6 when it launches later this year.</li>
<li><strong>Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise: </strong>We’ll be modifying subscription pricing and the qualifying annual revenue thresholds, effective January 1, 2025. These changes will apply to all new and existing Unity Pro and Enterprise customers when you purchase, upgrade, or renew a subscription on or after this date.
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Pro:</strong> An 8% subscription price increase to $2,200 USD annually per seat will apply to Unity Pro. Unity Pro will be required for customers with more than $200,000 USD of total annual revenue and funding.</li>
<li><strong>Unity Enterprise:</strong> A 25% subscription price increase will apply to Unity Enterprise. Unity Enterprise will be required for customers with more than $25 million USD of total annual revenue and funding. A minimum subscription requirement may also apply. Because this set of our largest customers have unique needs and use many of our products and services, we’ll be contacting everyone in the days ahead to discuss customized packages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Pretty big bump in prices there for Pro and Enterprise though.</em></p>
<p>This is a nice win for game developers, because it really was a stupid policy having an individual install fee.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor gets Denuvo DRM removed, plus performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for DRM haters. STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor has been liberated as of the latest update which also thankfully continues improving the performance too.</p>
<p>I've actually held off on playing it through fully myself due to how bad the initial release was, so maybe I'll be jumping back in to get it done now too. That's the problem with games that are pushed out too soon, of which we've seen a shocking lot of lately, there's so many other games coming out that you can easily move onto.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13419889431726151760gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Respawn / EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> Patch 9 today which notes very clearly "Denuvo DRM has been removed". Plus these other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Performance Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Framerate improvements for various hardware configurations.</li>
<li>Fixes for several sources of framerate hitching for smoother gameplay.</li>
<li>Ray Tracing has been optimized for CPU usage and should now scale better for high-end GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixes for performance related to using a mouse as gameplay input.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The “Optimizing Game Files” screen has been optimized and can now see speed increases from multiple CPU cores.</li>
<li>Mouse and keyboard functionality has been improved across a variety of menu screens, including the first time user screens, title menu, game menu, and workbench.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed collision issue where players could fall through elevators at low framerates.</li>
<li>Fix for a conversation-related crash when walking away from NPC characters.</li>
<li>Fix for various, intermittent crashes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you've been holding off, it truly sounds like this is the absolute best time to grab it. Unless you're waiting on a sale that is, in which case fair enough.</p>

      <title>Wizard of Legend 2 comes to Early Access on October 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original Wizard of Legend was absolutely brilliant when it came out, fun solo and great fun in co-op with the spell combinations and great action. So I expect good things from Wizard of Legend 2.</p>
<p>Announced today, it's entering Early Access on October 3rd. This time though, it will only officially support Windows, so Linux Desktop / Steam Deck players will need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before: it's an action-packed rogue-lite in which players take on perilous, ever-shifting trials across various types of environments filled with all sorts of enemies. Since you're all Wizards, you get to wield various different elemental magics that you combine together to form all your attacks. This time around you get a more 3D environment which looks rather pretty. Co-op is back too, and at the 1.0 release they will bump it up to 4 players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T2ycv86a3Us"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73a0603190c224189455e90ccafb6639.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T2ycv86a3Us" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced 3D Visuals: Experience the Floating Lands like never before with stunning new 3D graphics that bring the world’s vibrant and dynamic magic to life.</li>
<li>Co-Op Magic: Team up with a friend in 2 player co-op at launch, with plans to expand to 4-player co-op in future updates. Whether you choose local or online play, coordinating with allies will be key to conquering the trials.</li>
<li>Master New and Familiar Arcana: Command a range of elemental powers including fire, water, earth, lightning, air, and chaos. Discover new Arcana and experiment with spell combinations that can drastically alter your gameplay.</li>
<li>Rogue-Lite Replayability: Each trial is uniquely challenging, with procedurally generated elements and a persistent progression system. Expect around 10-15 hours of gameplay, but with the rogue-lite structure, replayability is endless.</li>
<li>Community-Driven Development: The shift to Early Access comes in response to valuable feedback from the Steam Next Fest demo. The development team is committed to using this feedback to refine and enhance the game, ensuring that Wizard of Legend 2 delivers the best possible experience.</li>
<li>Trial-Ready Gauntlet: Navigate the ever-shifting gauntlet conjured by Hieronymus, Lanova’s wizard supreme, and encounter a diverse array of trials overseen by the enigmatic members of the wizarding council.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193540/Wizard_of_Legend_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. I'm hoping to take a look at this one for the release, since I enjoyed the first so much, so I'll report on how it runs with Proton.</p>

      <title>With some really intense fights, action-adventure Veil of Shadows is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Veil of Shadows from Imponix Game Studio is out today, bringing with it an action-adventure with some gorgeous pixel-art. It has full Native Linux support and there's also a demo available.</p>
<p>More about it: "Sirene wakes up in a forest with few memories of how she ended up there. Her journey begins by trying to understand what is happening to her and soon having to fight for her survival. Help Sirene understand what is going on and escape this agony."</p>
<p>The idea of the game is that you're collecting fragments of your memory. Each piece you get slowly brings it all together towards the finale where you will uncover the truth of your strange appearance in the forest. Yes, I know, the whole protagonist with amnesia thing again but it's quite a good one. With combat inspired by the classics mechanically, you get a bit of freedom in how you tackle all the fights due to ability upgrades and game-changing perks too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Wine team now hosting Mono, looking to adopt the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the news recently that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/microsoft-donates-the-mono-project-to-the-wine-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft gave the Mono Project over to the Wine</a> team, it has now been moved over to the Wine GitLab. Plus, some changes for Wine contributors may be coming with a new Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>A bunch of changes were <a href="https://marc.info/?l=wine-devel&amp;m=172608188630928&amp;w=2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on the Wine Developer mailing list from Alexandre Julliard. Which include some modernisation for the project. The Wiki was moved over to their GitLab along with appdb, vkd3d and wine-staging having their own Wiki too.</p>
<p>The Mono Project is now hosted directly by the Wine team on their GitLab, plus they've upgraded the server hardware for their GitLab which is "now noticeably faster" which will hopefully aid development for all the contributors long into the future.</p>
<p>Sadly they've had a bit of a spam problem which is why GitLab issue trackers were disabled, but they're going to be re-enabled with "an explicit user verification step, modelled along the procedure used by Freedesktop.org".</p>
<p>Lastly, along with the new sign-up process, they're currently looking into forming a proper Code of Conduct to "spell out our expectations". They're currently looking into using the popular <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Contributor Covenant</a>, which was designed especially for open source communities. The Contributor Covenant is pretty simple to understand, and a lot of it is based on just reinforcing acceptable behaviour, not particularly different to the rules most forums have (including our comments and forum).</p>

      <title>JRPG-inspired adventure with a puzzle-battle system &#39;Flowstone Saga&#39; launches September 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Impact Gameworks, developer of the popular and rather fantastic Tangledeep, have announced recently that their brand new game Flowstone Saga launches on September 17th. This unique blend of a 16-bit JRPG-inspired world with a puzzle-battle system really looks great, and it will have Native Linux support just like the first game.</p>
<p>More about it: "Enter the world of Ocean’s End and play as Mirai – a spunky heroine who builds her party and home as she begins to embrace her new-found powers and find her place in the world. With an innovative twist on combat, Flowstone Saga allows players to choose at will between turn-based and real-time combat – skillfully making use of puzzle combat mechanics to shake things up. Tactical thinking triumphs over pirates, giant beetles, and at least ONE axolotl! Fans of classic SNES and PlayStation RPGs will feel right at home as they explore, build, fight, and cast their way through Flowstone Saga’s mysterious world."</p>

      <title>Looking to upgrade your Steam Deck? How about some fancy metal buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deck Buttons have released a fresh set of fancy button upgrades for your Steam Deck, this time blending together real metal and high-quality resin for a really unique look.</p>
<p>They already sold a fair few different types of button upgrades to replace inside your Steam Deck like a Game Boy inspired set and various Neon colours but their latest selection is quite different. Although, swapping out the buttons can be quite a pain to do since it requires some very careful backplate removal and removing various parts inside the Deck. Still, they look <em>awesome</em>!</p>
<p>Available across copper and aluminium you can style them a bit yourself, although they ship looking "raw" you could polish them or perhaps use some steel wool to give them a brushed-like effect. There's a few possibilities here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3243112171726140648gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3243112171726140648gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19062762681726140649gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19062762681726140649gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Available for pre-order with shipping expected in the second week of October.</p>
<p>Check out the overview video below and see more on <a href="https://deckbuttons.com/products/metal_steam_deck_buttons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the web store</a>:</p>

      <title>Hive Jump 2: Survivors is an addictive blend of Vampire Survivors and Brotato with a Jetpack</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There may come a day where I get tired of survivor-like bullet hell shooters, but it's clearly not today. Hive Jump 2: Survivors just released and I've had a real blast with it. It was previously in Early Access, with the 1.0 release out now. <em>Note: Key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>Here you're tasked with a pretty simple objective: take down the alien hives while lasting as long as you can, which is a lot easier said than done. It has the usual staples of the genre that we've come to know and love with various types of enemies to squash, where you pick up little experience orbs to level up and pick from upgrades which Vampire Survivors made popular.</p>
<p>It also blends in the shop system that made Brotato great too. It's a wave-based auto-shooter, and when a wave is finished you can then buy weapons from a shop, or combine two of the same type (and same level) to make something even more powerful. Eventually, you can become a true bug-stomping machine. However, you never actually feel over-powered.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3708102931726138375gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3708102931726138375gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16273042431726138376gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16273042431726138376gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Hive Jump 2: Survivors with my favourite upgrade, the electric fence.</em></p>
<p>In Hive Jump 2: Survivors though you only have a very limited selection of weapons available, which makes the decision on what build to go for a little harder when you keep being presented with new weapon options but you're already into upgrading a few.</p>
<p>Part of the fun here is your Jetpack. You can use it to quickly hop over enemies and obstacles. A lot of the upgrades are linked to it to (not all, but quite a few). So you can move faster, shoot faster, throw grenades more quickly and so on while you're boosting yourself around. It nicely adds to the chaos and makes it different enough that it's not a bore to play and not yet-another plain survivor-like clone. It thankfully still manages to feel unique and just a thorough blast to play through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WrZTI0i7Iqo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b46b58b35b2c3b829d23c7cce5957364.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WrZTI0i7Iqo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a few other fun features included to set it apart too. There's a challenge system that pops up now and then to give you some extras like taking no damage from enemies for a wave. Add to that the point of the game: taking down alien hives. These are bullet-sponges, that can take a moment to destroy while you're also being swarmed by aliens. Once destroyed though, you then get a special equipment drop to give a big buff to something.</p>
<p>Really challenging with the different types of bugs too, there's even a little Starship Troopers thrown in there with artillery bugs that shoot out of their back. They're damn annoying when you're already surrounded.</p>
<p>A nice meta-upgrade system too, so going through numerous runs does actually have a point to it. There's a few characters to unlock with different starting weapons or abilities. Plus there's about 35 other types of meta-upgrades from health to movement speed, increases for different types of games to better wave-finish store prices and more.</p>
<p>The only real complaints I have is that firstly I would have loved to see more variety in the weapons. What's there is great fun to annihilate the bug menace with, but I would have just liked to see some more different types. Additionally, more map variety would have been good too. Another slight nuisance is the upgrade system when you've started upgrading your three slots, it gives you too many options you can't use without replacing what you have. Some tweaks there would be nice to see.</p>
<p>Overall, Hive Jump 2: Survivors nicely sets itself apart in a genre that's now getting swarmed. It's absolutely worth picking up if you enjoy a <em>lot</em> of action and testing out various different character builds.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader 3.0 is out now for Steam Deck plugins on the latest Steam update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Many months in the making, the Decky Loader developers have released version 3.0 of their Steam Deck plugin system, which works with the big Steam Families update. So you'll need to update to continue using Decky Loader, as the 2.x series breaks on the new Steam Client update.</p>
<p>The developers are keen to note that if you were on the Decky Loader pre-release branch due to being in the Steam Beta, you'll need to switch back to Decky Loader stable now since the pre-release builds are "frequently updated branch that provides no promises of stability".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12250499041726132966gol1.png"/></p>
<p>What's actually changed? Frankly, there's too many individual improvements to list. But some quick highlights:</p>
<p>For users it should provide a more stable experience overall. There's better error handling, more in-depth progress notifications for Decky and plugins. Along with Decky being properly usable without an internet connection. There's also various UI styling improvements. You should also hopefully never see the boot-loop problem again with some recent changes.</p>
<p>For developers they overhauled the plugin API so it should be significantly easier to use, and also now asynchronous. Plus an easy way was added for backend to frontend communication. Plugin developers will likely need to go back and update any they've made.</p>
<p>See more about Decky Loader on the <a href="https://decky.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Families has officially launched with a big Steam Client Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck, Valve has officially launched the new Steam Families system in a stable Steam Client Update. <em>The system was in Beta since March.</em></p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> yet bring Steam Game Recording into the stable client, but it does make some UI changes to prepare for it. You'll still need to stay opted into the Beta for all that, but hopefully that will properly ship soon too.</p>
<p>For those who haven't been in the Beta, it <em>finally</em> means your whole Steam Library doesn't get locked down when someone is playing a completely different game. Amongst many other nice improvements like vastly improved parental controls. Overall, a really great update that continues to show why most people prefer Steam.</p>
