      <title>Here&#39;s all the games to claim for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming as of May 9th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 9th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>This word-game roguelike looks unique and has one of the longest names I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game marketing, you gotta love it. How can you make your small indie game stand out? A great game doesn't always stand on its own, so why not give it a ridiculously long name. </p>
<p>Why am I not putting the name in the article title like I usually do? Well, it's called "If Letters Had Pants, Would They Wear Them Like This? What About Numbers? What If They Had Small Shovels And They Dug Stuff Up To Put In A Museum?" and uh, yeah that's certainly a choice that was made. It's not the longest name of a game ever but certainly up there in the top I think.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13329989841746795343gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From PUNKCAKE Délicieux it's a word-game that looks a bit like something i would have done at school, but turned into a fancy little roguelike.</p>
<p>Via the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Make words that let you make words</h4>
<p>Find words in a randomized grid of letters. The used letters will leave empty spaces, which the other letters can bridge, allowing for words that weren't possible before, over larger and larger areas. And if words aren't helping, you can also use bombs to clear up blocking letters.</p>
<p>Your score depends on both the length of the word, and the size of the area it spans. Make longer words over bigger areas to score more points and reach the level's goal before the timer runs out!</p>
<h4>But it's also a roguelike?</h4>
<p>If you manage to complete the level, you will be presented with 3 pairs of pants for 3 different letters. Pants give unique bonuses to letters, a letter can be worth more, or maybe it multiplies the whole word’s value, or maybe it gives you bombs or does other things!</p>
<h4>And there's a museum involved??</h4>
<p>Beneath the earth you will find objects lost to time. (and to their owners) While making words, you also dig the earth and uncover these sometimes-precious items. Find them, sell them, and expand your museum, then place the items in the museum and unlock new gameplay modifiers as the museum’s collection completes!</p>
<p>Plays entirely with the mouse. An average run may last 15 to 30 minutes. You may play with the English, French, or Spanish dictionary.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>A first for the series having VR support, but that's entirely optional for the PC release, you can run it normally just like the previous games. And it appears it will once again have a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>They developer said: "Combining the best elements of previous Bridge Constructor games with a modern, charming visual style – and featuring an intuitive building system, easy controls, no budget constraints, and optional challenges – it’s the ultimate playground for seasoned builders as well as newcomers to the series".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EgB0DeIh-qg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37533543e93b31e9b807927be800a68f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EgB0DeIh-qg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Limitless Creativity – With no budget or material restrictions, you can freely experiment and design without limits. For an extra challenge, earn a special reward by keeping costs within a set budget while ensuring your bridge holds up under pressure!</li>
<li>Diverse Environments – Build bridges across five beautiful biomes, from skyscraper-filled cities to snowy canyons, lush green valleys, and more. The possibilities are endless with seven unique vehicles offering different physics and challenges!

      <title>Killing Floor 3 now set for release on July 24 after being delayed to improve it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Killing Floor 3 was originally due to release in March, but feedback was pretty bad from their Beta and so they delayed it to rework various parts of it. Now, it's set for launch on July 24.</p>
<p>They've been regularly detailing the enhancements to the game across Steam and social media, so hopefully this will make it a good release. Would be a shame for the series to go downhill for the third game after the first two were much loved by players.</p>
<p>“Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we’ve dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community’s feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision,” said Bryan Wynia, Creative Director at Tripwire Interactive. “The support from our fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we're thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7965042251746793911gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Killing Floor 3 </em></strong>is the next installment in the legendary co-op action/horror FPS series. The year is 2091, 70 years after the events in <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, and megacorp Horzine has produced the ultimate army: an obedient horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. Now, the only thing standing between these infernal creations and the future of humanity is the rebel rogue group known as Nightfall. This intense first-person shooter puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, joining forces with up to five teammates as they battle through a war-ravaged, dystopian future, surviving unrelenting waves of Zeds, unlocking new skills, and building the ultimate arsenal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you planning to pick this one up? From the Beta, it did seem to run just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton. On Steam Deck on Low details, the Beta did manage <em>mostly</em> 30FPS too but it did not look good at all.</p>

      <title>GOG begin rolling out dynamic bundle pricing to complete your collections</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something I'm surprised <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> didn't have before. They've now begun rolling out dynamic bundle pricing to help you complete your collections. Here's what that means for purchasing on GOG.</p>
<p>Much like other stores (hi Steam), when you go to purchase a bundle you might already have some of the games in it. Steam offered a type of bundle called "Complete The Set" for a long time now, which means you don't end up spending more than necessary just to grab what you don't have. GOG now do this too, finally.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As they posted on the GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/were_rolling_out_the_first_batch_of_bundles_with_dynamic_pricing/post1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> at the end of April:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We’ve just launched the first batch of bundles with fully functioning dynamic pricing. It’s a feature many of you might recognize from other platforms, but for those who don’t, here’s how it works:</p>
<p>When purchasing a bundle, you only pay for the items you don’t already own, making it easy to complete your collection without spending more than necessary.</p>
<p>We know this has been a long-requested feature, and that the lack of it has been frustrating for many of you. That’s why we’re super excited to finally start introducing it to the store, and we hope you’re just as happy to see it live.</p>
<p>Now, what do we mean by “start introducing” and “first batch of bundles”?</p>
<p>Well, right now this dynamic pricing system is available for 24 bundles in the store (you’ll find the full list in my comment below). We'll continue expanding this feature to more and more bundles – new and old – with the goal of eventually covering the vast majority (if not all) of them. You’ll know a bundle has dynamic pricing from the information displayed under its price on the game page.</p>
<p>Note: If you already own all components of a dynamically priced bundle, you’ll be able to “claim” that bundle in the store so it shows as owned.</p>
<p>You might also be wondering: What about various game editions that include base games + DLCs?</p>
<p>We completely agree that bringing dynamic pricing to those would be a huge improvement, for both you and us. It’s something we’re actively looking into, and we hope to expand the system in that direction. We can’t promise an ETA just yet, but we’re optimistic it’ll happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>That’s all for now! Give this new system a try, see how it works for you, and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support! :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They ended up <em>disabling</em> the system due to various problems with it, but now it's back and live and should be working properly with a few minor quirks they're still working out.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the bundles that have this enabled include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Resident Evil Bundle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_40k_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40K Bundle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_the_source_saga" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Divinity: Original Sin - The Source Saga</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RollerCoaster Tycoon Bundle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/myst_riven_the_definitive_collection" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Myst &amp; Riven: The Definitive Collection</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And there's more listed on the <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG store</a>.</p>

<p>Awesome. I haven't gotten around to it yet but it's on my list, big fan of the first game in the series. Wonderful to see patience pay off again to get the best form of it. Really good to see such big games do direct Steam Deck support like this.</p>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle now Steam Deck Verified with the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from MachineGames / Bethesda Softworks has a fresh update out, and with it Valve have now rated it Steam Deck Verified. Nice to see more developers ensure their games work better.</p>
<p>Going by their Steam announcement, they've implemented a dedicated Steam Deck setting for the "Texture Pool Size", which will stop it overloading and causing the game to crash. Other settings have been left as they are. So this likely doesn't improve performance, and according to our pals at <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> there's still some loading time issues too. But at least it will now run properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/717456821746786117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/523090745159058326?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is now Verified for Steam Deck! Fresh game profiles will now default to optimized settings for running the game on Steam Deck.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> When running the game on Steam Deck, the “Texture Pool Size” is now set to a value called “Steam Deck” to avoid exceeding RAM limits that will crash the game. Other graphics options can still be adjusted to preference.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where extremely rapid switching of your equipped items with the d-pad at the same time as picking other objects up could result in you permanently dropping important progression items such as your camera, lighter or whip. Players who have experienced this should find those items restored when launching the game with this hotfix installed</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Iraq cave door was closed when revisiting that level, preventing you from revisiting the main chamber</li>
<li>Improvements to DualSense wireless controller Adaptive Triggers to prevent them from quietly “clicking” when looking at friendly NPCs</li>
<li>Menu option added to allow modification of DualSense wireless controller Adaptive Trigger strength, including an “Off” option.
	<ul>
<li>Note: For Steam players, the game now has Steam Input defaulted to Off for PlayStation controllers, so that more players can discover the DualSense features on PC. If you wish to reenable Steam Input, you can do that from the Controller section of the game Properties in the Steam launcher</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the “Forgotten Page” activity note might fail to appear in Sunan’s hut in Sukhothai if you did not pick it up in the Hotel when first arriving in Sukhothai</li>
<li>Fixed one known cause of an issue preventing players from being given the “Archivist” achievement. Players should find that the achievement will pop as soon as gameplay is started after installing the hotfix. Other causes of this bug may exist; please contact Bethesda Support to share details if you continue to experience this issue</li>
</ul>

      <title>System76 COSMIC entering Beta soon and their Serval WS laptop gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have launched a brand new and upgraded Serval WS premium laptop that sounds delicious, and I have hardware envy now. Additionally, it seems their COSMIC desktop is due to expand soon.</p>
<p>Their new Serval WS laptop has display bump with a 16-inch, 2560×1600, 240Hz panel. Backed up by an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti that should cover all your needs from work to gaming. The processor has been upped as well with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU. <em>Overall it sounds like quite the little powerhouse.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18400669431746782846gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Spec highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU.</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.</li>
<li>Up to 96GB DDR5 RAM (5600 MHz). Base model is 32 GB DDR5 5600 MHz (2x16).</li>
<li>Up to 12TB PCIe 5.0 &amp; 4.0 storage. Base model is 1 TB PCIe4 (up to 5,000 MB/s read, 3,600 MB/s write).</li>
<li>16” 16:10 2K display at 240Hz.</li>
<li>2.5GbE Ethernet.</li>
<li>WiFi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4.</li>
<li>Your choice between:
	<ul>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS with full disk-encryption.</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The price is a little eye-watering though as $2,999 being a premium high-spec laptop. From a smaller vendor it's not surprising but they also have some of the best Linux support of course. Shipping starts in late May.</p>
<p>As for the COSMIC desktop environment, their press release noted "System76 is working on COSMIC, their new open source desktop environment created for Pop!_OS. COSMIC is soon entering the beta phase. Once cleared for release, users can look forward to more battery life, cooler temperatures, more features, and an overall intuitive software experience."</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Battery Charge Limit control in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a long time of users asking, Valve has actually added an official Battery Charge Limit setting in the latest Steam Deck Beta update so you no longer need to use third-party tools.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the most-requested features people have wanted to see. Very useful for keeping your battery healthy, especially if you're leaving it charged and docked all the time.</p>
<p>From the May 8th release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Battery Charge Limit control to Settings-&gt;Power
	<ul>
<li>This option allows you to set a maximum charge limit for your Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Limiting the charge limit to 80% can be beneficial for long term battery health. This can be useful if your Steam Deck is constantly being charged (i.e. docked), or very rarely has its battery depleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moved display dim and suspend timeout settings to Settings-&gt;Power.</li>
<li>Moved 'Show Battery Percentage' setting to Settings-&gt;Power.</li>
<li>Fixed pasting from on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Speculative Fix for rare DualSense Edge gyroscope related bug.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Paradox Interactive announce Europa Universalis V</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive / Paradox Tinto have today announced Europa Universalis V, the next in the series of their popular historical grand strategy games. They said that Paradox Tinto have been designing it over the last five years.</p>
<p>"Europa Universalis V has been crafted with the devoted Paradox fan in mind, incorporating feedback delivered by the fan community over a year of public discussion, and giving this dedicated audience a voice in the realization of this new vision. Europa Universalis V draws inspiration from the latest generation of Paradox historical titles, expanding the range of possibilities available for the largest and most detailed Europa Universalis game ever made. " - Paradox</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MKaGSIm9juI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8a5f51c60c8e24e4d7a46aa69b7ab3d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MKaGSIm9juI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features of Europa Universalis V include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New and Larger Map: </strong>Using a more accurate map projection to better reflect the size of the continents, <em>Europa Universalis V</em> lets you choose from any of hundreds of different societies. Start as a mighty emperor or a local chieftain or warlord anywhere on earth. A more detailed map allows for a greater number of nations and more varied topographical features.</li>
<li><strong>A Longer Time Scale: </strong>The game’s campaign starts in 1337, the year of the opening of the Hundred Years’ War - the great struggle over the French crown that marked the zenith of the late Medieval era. Lead your nation through the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and other historical ages, choosing how you will adjust to an ever changing world.</li>
<li><strong>Population Based System: </strong>Departing from the familiar province-focused system of earlier games in the series, <em>Europa Universals V</em> represents the population of each province in detail. Manage cultural and religious tensions in your realm, deal with estates as they wax and wane in power, and meet the basic and luxury demands of this varied population.</li>
<li><strong>Thousands of Historical Events: </strong>Watch history unfold before you as the great moments of the past make their mark on your game. Dynamically responding to the game situation, these historical events challenge players to repeat or improve on the great accomplishments of the past.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Production and Trade System: </strong>Build farms, plantations, crafting buildings and factories to provide goods to satisfy your economic and military needs. Or, if your nation can’t provide the things you need, trade for them from neighboring nations.Some buildings require specific goods to be in supply, so you either invest in new industries or make a deal with your neighbors. Use roads, ports and fleets to expand your trading region and enrich your nation by managing the wealth of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Design a Nation to Suit Your Situation: </strong>Adopt policies and laws to adapt to your situation as you discover new technologies and ideas. Move towards greater centralization or a looser power sharing arrangement. Build an army based on masses of manpower or a more elite professional force. Will you be tolerant of other faiths and cultures, or advocate for a single faith and single culture? A world of possibilities awaits you.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Military and Diplomatic Systems: </strong>Dominate the world through either sword or pen. Rally mercenaries, levies or professional soldiers to your flag as you cut a blood path through history. But be careful! A bloody war fought with levies has a direct impact on your population. Consider a lighter touch, using royal marriages, trade treaties and alliances to expand your power and preserve peace.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's not currently clear is if it will have Native Linux support like previous in-house stuff from Paradox. Steam only currently lists Windows PC as supported. I've reached out to Paradox PR to clarify if we'll need to use Proton for this.</p>
<p>There's currently no release date announced for it yet.</p>

      <title>Control an interstellar train in the deck-builder Break Siege out now in Early Access</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another strategy game with trains? Sign me up. Break Siege from FojoGames just hit Early Access and looks like it could be another good one.<em> If you missed them a few others I found with trains recently were <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/apocalypse-express-is-a-challenging-train-combat-management-roguelike-with-a-demo-you-need-to-try/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apocalypse Express</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/build-a-train-to-expand-your-deck-and-fight-off-bandits-in-the-demo-for-fogpiercer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fogpiercer</a>.</em></p>
<p>With each game being a fresh procedurally generated adventure, it's different each time. Here you build up your train as you go, and then engage in explosive real-time battles using various cards. Your train is a bit special too, being able to travel between planets and all. As you progress through it you'll go through various different events, and build up a team of mercenaries to buff you.</p>

      <title>In the survivorlike ARPG &#39;Conquest Dark&#39; you start off nude and build up clothing as you go with multi-life mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just what the survivorlike bullet heaven genre thingy needed - nudity! Conquest Dark from Eldritch Sword Games actually has quite a number of fun game mechanics worth exploring, the nudity is optional but it has a point. Tested on Desktop Linux with Proton, it works perfectly. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>To be clear; by default your character will have some underwear on, which you can toggle off in the settings. What's the point then? The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3238670/discussions/0/594022012433734268/#c594022012433735024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted the world to feel dark, primal, and brutal, and also create strong contrast between the character's initial state and the state at which you end up after acquiring power. The most primal state you can start is naked, just with your fists as weapons, and then progress to a god-like champion with golden armor and a flaming sword.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds fair enough to me. It's not like staring at a willy or boobs is the focus of the game, it's about showing how vulnerable you start off in it. Then again, the same feeling can be gained from seeing you suit-up as you continually level-up from underwear (but hey, options are nice?). You even start off by picking between different undressed characters of different classes, races and genders each with their own set of different initial stats.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uq7-6ZAYU6E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1762ea94bd3ed98fcf326e2f3d46056f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uq7-6ZAYU6E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>That's a very nicely crafted trailer too that really helps sell it I think.</em></p>
<p>This was an accidental discovery of mine when browsing Bluesky, coming <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madmushroom.gg/post/3lolqqaqccs24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">across a post</a> from the developer where they recently announced they've managed to sell over 63,000 units in the first week of release. They've built up a Very Positive rating on Steam already too and I can clearly see why — I'm already hooked on it.</p>
<p>Conquest Dark has multiple game mechanics that I think are interesting to genuinely make it feel a bit different, and a bit more like a proper ARPG blended with the features popularised by Vampire Survivors. In a way, it's a little bit more like the excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/fight-off-the-immense-hordes-in-halls-of-torment-1-0-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Halls of Torment</a> for building up the character with items as you go, although in much smaller more claustrophobic arenas more like the also great <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/brotato-10-is-out-now-and-its-a-damn-good-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brotato</a>.</p>
<p>Actually seeing your chosen character go from wiggling their bits to the world, to being covered in clothing and armour might seem like a small thing on the surface, but it really helps add to that feeling of becoming overpowered that the genre is much loved for.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/915839641746705032gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/915839641746705032gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/609577601746705970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/609577601746705970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's so many different types of character builds that you can do that makes the repeated runs really fun, making me itch just to give it another go. My favourite run in it so far was with a bow that I powered up to fire shots that bounce between enemies, while also sometimes setting them ablaze, with multiple multi-shot abilities and constantly picked a buff to my attack speed on level-up that I was just firing arrows constantly and it got quite hilarious. Very satisfying to hear the constant crunch of my arrows tearing through skeletons.</p>
<p>You have a dodge ability in the game too, which you can also power up and turn it into something else. You could make it so as an archer to fire off multiple arrows when you dodge, or completely change it into a leap as a barbarian when you smash down into a group of enemies, which is especially fun if you go through the upgrades to get multiple charges and just repeatedly leap around the arena. There's so many different ways to power-up differently each time.</p>
<p>Here you also get to start with 10 lives. Each life lost results in a health reset, but you'll begin bleeding more and more to have your health go down faster, eventually to your death. There's various ways to counter it (apart from not repeatedly dying) like ability buffs to reduce bleeding, or abilities that end up spawning lots of healing orbs. It doesn't make it all that difficult, but just an interesting life system that keeps you on your toes a bit.</p>
<p>True to the genre, the more you play of it the more of it you'll unlock. You play across a map with different nodes, with each node being split between arena fights, altars you can pop resources into to power up some more, obelisks to power up the enemies to give yourself an added challenge (and some extra resources) and more. When you manage to fully complete an arena fight, you'll also unlock more of the game like extra character classes and abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16983106471746706060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16983106471746706060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not perfected yet though. It's Early Access, so rough edges are to be expected, and in some ways the overall content is limited but there's enough there for hours and hours to play right now. My main wish for it is to have some more arenas that are faster, as in general the game is a bit on the slower side.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3238670/view/523090745159057457" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> that's been put up has me excited for the future additions too like new events, new weapons and armour, a new class and more.</p>
<p>For a solo developer, this is really impressive and continues to show how you can do a lot with a little.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fire Totem Games have announced their really sweet spider physics game A Webbing Journey is finally ready for an Early Access release on May 19th. It will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swing from place to place, crawl over every surface (even upside down!) and weave crazy webs in this adorable spider sandbox. </p>
<p>Silky is a tiny hero on a big mission - to help their favourite humans! Baking cookies? Doing dishes? Watering plants? No task is too big if you’ve got the imagination (and the spiderwebs!) to pull it off!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Early Access release they said it will have 3 fully interactive levels to explore with many different types of quests. During EA they'll be adding in more rooms, more customization, new challenges and game modes, an expanded story and potentially multiplayer. They say the current EA version "already offers a solid sandbox experience".</p>
<p>There's also a new trailer:</p>

      <title>Palworld devs confirm game changes due to the Nintendo / Pokemon lawsuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we all suspected, recent changes to Palworld game mechanics were as a direct result of the ongoing lawsuit filed against developer Pocketpair from Nintendo / The Pokemon Company.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on X and their official company website reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</p>
<p>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.<br/>
We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</p>
<p>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.<br/>
We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><div class="itemdb_embed"><p><strong><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/itemdb/app/40377/palworld/">Palworld</a></strong> | Release Date: 19th January 2024<p class="plain-list-title">Official links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/">Steam</a></li></ul></p></div></p>
<hr/>
<p>Regardless of my opinion on Palworld as a game, and how I feel about Nintendo handling this, I think that the whole idea of game mechanics being able to be locked behind a patent so only one company can use it are ridiculous. Just look at the Nemesis system from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Such things should simply not be allowed. The system is not fit for purpose.</p>

      <title>SILENT HILL 2 remake gets a surprise GOG release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out of nowhere <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/silent_hill_2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG added the SILENT HILL 2 remake</a> from Bloober Team SA and KONAMI, so now more people get to play this highly rated horror DRM-free. It's also 30% off for a whole week too which is the joint cheapest it has been with the Steam release.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K5JX6fufUVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64bff1c4ef9161bfdca0328bd3dde02a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K5JX6fufUVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<h5>High-end Graphics and Sound</h5>
<p>With ray tracing and other cutting-edge technical enhancements, the world of SILENT HILL and its unsettling ambiance is even realer than before.</p>
<p>And with the inclusion of new, immersive soundscapes, you'll feel like you're standing in the thick of it.</p>
<h5>Larger Environments</h5>
<p>Explore locations and buildings that were once inaccessible, or are newly added in the remake.</p>
<p>Enjoy the same acclaimed story, even while you experience the town of Silent Hill with fresh eyes across an expanded map.</p>
<h5>Over-the-shoulder Camera</h5>
<p>The remake moves from the original's fixed-camera viewpoints to an over-the-shoulder perspective, putting you closer to what James sees, for a more thrilling, more immersive experience as you explore the town and come face-to-face with monsters.</p>
<h5>Evolved Combat Gameplay</h5>
<p>Familiar weapons like the steel pipe and handgun make their return, but now with an updated combat system.</p>
<p>Avoid attacks with carefully timed dodges, aim down sights, and more, making monster encounters more engaging and nerve-wracking than ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's good to see that GOG are getting big games in addition to keeping up with the expansion of their support for old games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/breath-of-fire-iv-for-pc-returns-with-an-updated-gog-release-plus-more-games-join-the-gog-preservation-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breath of Fire IV for PC</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/multiple-star-wars-classics-join-the-gog-preservation-program-with-a-big-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Star Wars games</a>.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.1 open source graphics drivers are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Engestrom today officially announced the full release of Mesa 25.1, bringing with it plenty of upgrades for open source graphics drivers.</p>
<p>As always, if you want a stable experience it's likely best to wait for the first bug-fix release with Mesa 25.1.1, which is due in about two weeks on May 21st.</p>
<p>From the release announcement Engestrom mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the big news in this release is that the Asahi driver has been fully mainlined into Mesa, as its UAPI was merged into the kernel. This means that custom builds are no longer needed for distros that want to support Apple hardware.</p>
<p>Panfrost also gained support for Mali G720/G925, and YCbCr support in PanVK for v10+ GPUs (Gxxx).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users can expect the usual flurry of improvements across all drivers and components, including these new extensions &amp; features highlighted by their developers (in no particular order):<br/>
- cl_khr_spirv_linkonce_odr in rusticl<br/>
- storagePushConstant16 on panvk<br/>
- storageInputOutput16 on panvk<br/>
- VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve on panvk<br/>
- VK_KHR_separate_depth_stencil_layouts on panvk<br/>
- VK_EXT_separate_stencil_usage on panvk<br/>

      <title>Valve developers continue to impress, fixing Proton in less than a day for the Starfield Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bethesda have released a surprise Beta update for Starfield. The update brings with it numerous bug fixes, Creation Kit upgrades and there's even a new Very Low graphics setting option.</p>
<p>What's impressive here is how fast Valve and their contracted developers work. I <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7064#issuecomment-2855560418" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> the issue with the new Starfield Beta crashing on load on both Desktop Linux and Steam Deck only 18 hours ago, where you just saw an error message like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6264289251746622666gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6264289251746622666gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/dxil-spirv/issues/225#issuecomment-2858069497" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">already</a> a fix available from developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen. You have to use the "bleeding-edge" Beta of Proton Experimental to play it though, until a new release of Proton Experimental is out properly.</p>
<p>You need to find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library. Go to the Properties, Betas and select "bleeding-edge" (it should be first in the list). Although, keep in mind this will then use the bleeding-edge Beta for any game that's set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18318879001746622865gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18318879001746622865gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16956782961746622866gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16956782961746622866gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Don't expect this new Very Low graphics setting to really help it much on Steam Deck though, it's still performing terrible in my test running through New Atlantis today. Constantly below 30FPS across all upscaling methods, but at least for other areas of the game it might just make it that tiny bit more playable.</p>
<p>Nice to see Bethesda aren't entirely done with Starfield for anyone still interested in playing it through, but I don't think there's any chance of them truly turning it around.</p>

      <title>15 years after being cancelled, pirate-themed action game Captain Blood is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preservation is important for video games, but that often focuses on games that have been released. Here's a nice win for some developers though, as Captain Blood has managed to get released after being cancelled in 2010.</p>
<p>The game started development in the early 2000s, and then in early 2010 it was cancelled but publisher SNEG managed to help it cross the finishing line. Founded in 2021, SNEG, for those that don't know, is a tiny publisher started by former GOG staff. They're so small they don't even have a proper online presence but they work to bring back older games.</p>
<p>With the release they've even made sure it works well on Steam Deck. Valve have yet to rate it but they said "For those who want to play it on Steam Deck - do it. The game fully supports it. The interface, font size, controller support, and resolution have been adapted to provide the best possible experience from day one".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GB68zXbKIBo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73e3335d6b73878df07a417fc362df5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GB68zXbKIBo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game is a peculiar mixture of God of War blended with a pirate ship battles like an early Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and that might be enough to sell me on it. You just have to keep in mind the game design is very much rooted in the earlier 2000s with Xbox 360 era visuals. <em>A proper old school hack and slash.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epic Pirate Shenanigans: As Captain Blood, live the life of the bravest and most fearsome pirate on the Spanish Main (or at least fake it convincingly).</li>
<li>Intense Action: Dive into fiery hand-to-hand combat and show enemy pirates and landlubbers alike who's the boss with various slick combat techniques.</li>
<li>Ship Deck Brawls: Fight off enemy pirates trying to board your ship with unique moves, combos, and executions while blasting enemy ships to pieces with your cannons!</li>
<li>Arsenal of Awesomeness: Arm yourself with cutlasses, pistols, muskets, throwing knives, and hand bombs. Don’t forget those sneaky pirate tricks!</li>
<li>Graphic Novel Vibes: Enjoy a unique art style that feels like you're flipping through a pirate comic book.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Don&#39;t sleep on Cataclismo, building up fortresses like LEGO to defend against hordes is great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cataclismo is a game where you design and build a fortress to face off against waves of enemy hordes. The LEGO-like building system is a lot of fun, really letting your creativity shine. That is, until all your beautiful staircases and walls inevitably come crumbling down. <em>Note: key via the publisher.</em></p>
<p>It was in Early Access and just in March hit the 1.0 release and I've been having a lot of fun with this. The story campaign isn't really what sells this one at all. I mean, it's a nice way to play-through it, but all I want to do is sit and build awesome looking castles in a LEGO-like fashion until the sun goes down. Just to watch all my archers reign down hell on the approaching horrors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10021925481746619011gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The gameplay loop here is just endlessly satisfying. As you build up your defences with each individual brick, and there's many different types of bricks and different materials for quick or strong builds, watching it all come together is seriously slick. Even when things go wrong, and everything comes crumbling down (which it will, eventually), that's also just pure satisfaction to watch. So many stairs though, everything needs stairs. So you're going to end up with lots of them and it's a bit chaotic when those come crashing down and you're trying to reroute your people around to ensure the rest of it doesn't go with it.</p>
<p>Elevation is the key here, with different troops needing different levels, which is again where your block placing design will come into it to make full use of everyone you have.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yUL1zq9L89s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/759ca814b11379988c803853988c9924.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yUL1zq9L89s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An incredibly atmospheric game, with a simple yet inviting style that lets you focus on what it does best. You can get a lot of hours of building and tower defence out of this one spread across the campaign, the skirmish battle mode across different maps and the endless mode to see just how far you can go.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best horde defence games out there thanks to the modular building system. A real gem you shouldn't skip over. It works <em>great</em> on Desktop Linux with Proton. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable but doesn't really seem like a good fit on the handheld.</p>

      <title>A Slight Chance of Sawblades is a fun high-score chaser with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For readers who like their smaller, faster more casual high-score chasers you'll want to check out A Slight Chance of Sawblades. Chinykian Games just put up a demo you can try out which has a Linux version available.</p>
<p>It's raining sawblades in this one. In a tiny little box arena you have to run, dodge and double-jump over them all to last as long as possible, while also gathering tickets to unlock more. The demo offers 1 out of the 3 currently planned modes, and a small slice of the characters, sawblades and backgrounds you can unlock.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KzSX2JbebcY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8699946cdad4ac25eca52ac334231d3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KzSX2JbebcY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full game highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game Modes</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Mode</strong> - Jump over sawblades to score points. Do it fast to regain time and delay the inevitable Sudden Death!</li>
<li><strong>Phantom Mode</strong> - The player character is invisible in this mode! Rely on your superior spatial reasoning skills to survive in this unforgiving mode!</li>
<li><strong>Barrage Mode</strong> - Once spawned, every sawblade stays in the room forever. This mode is the very definition of the word "Overwhelming"!</li>
</ul>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill-based score-chasing action.</li>
<li>High-speed arcade gameplay with time pressure.</li>
<li>Juicy 8-bit style music.</li>
<li>Unlockable characters.</li>
<li>Unlockable game modes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A small and sweet indie game worth blasting through on your coffee-breaks. There's no date set for the full version yet but do give the demo a try and see how high you can make it. I'm useless at it, I've played for a lot longer than expected, determined to get higher and better at it but I'm just getting sliced to pieces. </p>

      <title>Hordes of Hunger turns Vampire Survivors into a fast 3D slasher from devs of Blood West</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With combat that feels more like a faster and slashier Diablo / Path of Exile, the latest game from Hyperstrange is Hordes of Hunger and so far it's a lot of fun. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I know, it really does seem like <em>everyone</em> is trying their hand at making some kind of survivorlike thing, but hey this is another one that actually feels a whole lot different. Not only is it actual proper 3D, but it's much more of an arena hack and slasher just with the progression style of Vampire Survivors with all the orb collecting and ridiculously overpowering yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5980126091746610776gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>One fun addition here is also the quest system. During your run through each map, it will sprinkle in some quests for you to do while you're trying to slice your way through an increasingly powerful and varied horde of monsters. </p>
<p>Not a big fan of the camera system in it currently though, with constantly spinning it around to see enemies coming at me. There's two different camera types. One that's more like a third-person action game that's fully manual, which they say is more developed and one more experimental they said is more like Vampire Survivors with the view pulled up higher and the camera moves slightly by itself to help you (but you can still manually move it). Neither feel particularly great right now.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take up Arms</strong> - Craft your own unique build with a range of weapons and special attacks, from a nimble swordfighter to a heavy hammer-wielder. From the castle keep to the desolate remains of your village, fight smart and use the environment to your advantage with choke points, high ground, and breakable structures.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome the Horde</strong> - The monsters are unrelenting, but so are you. Gain destructive and defensive abilities with each level-up to become a finely tuned force to be reckoned with. Strike down swarms with sword aflame, call down lightning as you land, and defy death with divine contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Uncover the Truth</strong> - A father racked with guilt. A prisoner who shuns freedom. A mother covered in blood. Mirah may be the only one who can save her home, but she's not alone. Complete missions in each run to save others from the invasion and discover the true nature of the curse that plagues Mirah’s homeland.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) it's been smooth slashing on this one. No Linux specific issue, Proton just runs it like any other game. Click and play.</p>
<p>It's now in Early Access, and as you might expect there's plenty of rough edges, but seriously promising. They're estimating six months of Early Access to add in more quests, new weapons, new enemies, new maps, new skill tress and more.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">If you love powering up characters during repeat runs and seeing how ridiculous things can get, this might be the game for you.</span></p>

      <title>Wipeout-like anti-grav racer BallisticNG v1.4 out now bringing lots of new content and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though it was Steam Deck Verified <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-wipeout-like-racer-ballisticng-gets-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>, that was Valve testing against an opt-in Beta (which is a bit weird) but now the big release is here for the anti-gravity racer BallisticNG. This update makes it easily one of the best racers of this type available today.</p>
<p>The 1.4 release brings with it a whole new series of ships along with their own different physics, AI improvements, modding improvements, various changes to improve it on Steam Deck like UI scaling along with a redesigned UI, various new tracks to race through, tweaks to existing tracks, new music, upgrades to the photo mode, lots of improvements to multiplayer and the list goes on. It really is a big upgrade for the game.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>

      <title>Metal Thunder puts you in a the gunner seat of an AC-130 with progression popularised by Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is quite a unique experience. Merging the progression system made popular by Vampire Survivors, with the aerial combat of Call of Duty’s AC-130 missions. Metal Thunder definitely has a fun idea to it. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>Currently in Early Access with it regular updates, I've been having a blast and I've ended up getting quite into it, as it's surprisingly challenging and engrossing trying to get through and survive all the missions as you defend various bases from enemy attacks. Building up an array of different weapons, some of which you can really overpower to rain down some pretty intense looking action.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HIuDzadXPZw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fa14e07606af7c150b3d29458b54095.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HIuDzadXPZw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>However, there is a <em>stain</em> against it in my book. One I didn't realise until after I had played it. The developer has used generative AI. The Steam store pages notes "We use AI to create store page and some in-game render assets". Speaking to the developer to clarify this, they told me "It's generally for promotional materials, as I don't currently have the budget to hire an artist part/full time yet. It will be phased out in due time".</p>
<p>That still makes me feel really uneasy. I really do hate generative AI being used in games, but I also <em>can't</em> ignore the fact that I've been really enjoying this, hence the uneasy feeling about it. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>AC-130 Gunship Combat - Command an AC-130, delivering powerful strikes to defend against relentless enemy waves.</li>
<li>20-Minute Survival Missions - Survive intense, escalating battles where every decision matters.</li>
<li>Procedural Enemy Waves - Fresh challenges each time with random enemy formations.</li>
<li>Upgrades and Abilities - Customize your gunship with powerful upgrades to fit your playstyle.</li>
<li>Unique Operations - Battle across 4 distinct locations at launch with unique objectives in Survival.</li>
<li>Endless Survival Mode - Test your endurance with waves that never stop.</li>
<li>High Replayability - Randomized waves, upgrades, and missions keep the gameplay fresh.</li>
<li>Immersive Visuals and Sound - Experience realistic effects, including a white-hot infrared view for night ops.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton it worked without an issue.</p>

      <title>Detective Dotson is a mystery adventure that&#39;s a love letter to India worth exploring out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a setting that not many games explore, Detective Dotson is a fresh adventure from Masala Games that's out now with Linux support. India is brought to life with some lovely pixel artwork in this new release, it's really quite eye-catching. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Not a point and click adventure though, this one is a side-scroller where you go through fun little quirky cases that eventually builds up to the darker main overall theme of what happened to your Father. This is a great little casual adventure for people to dive into.</p>
<p>One that gets you to think a little as you build up your evidence board on cases, but not overwhelming and not particularly difficult either. It's all about connecting the dots together, paying attention and exploring a bit of modern India. Check out the launcher trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KKuNFY6ZeWg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c8c48e4d43340bfd58891dde1738e14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KKuNFY6ZeWg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Play across 4 cases and 4 mini-games, that will see you through around 5 hours of gameplay. It's not too short, and doesn't overstay its welcome, feels just about right.</p>
<p>Speaking about the game and the setting, the Game Director mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storefronts are filled to the brim with a dime a dozen pixelated pleasures so why should you give ours a try? In a word: home. </p>
<p>You see, 18 percent of the world lives in India — our home. It’s the most diverse and interesting place on the planet. But, you really don’t get to see it in games much do you? We’re pretty much non-existent. So we took it upon ourselves at Masala Games to fix that. </p>
<p>We want to bring our home to you.</p>
<p>India is often (incorrectly) shown as poor or ancient, in media.<br/>
We want to tell stories from modern India — and represent our home more appropriately.</p>
<p>Detective Dotson is a love letter to India! Welcome to our home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, they even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zplMliWFpc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released an animated movie</a> too (English subtitles), which takes place before the game to give some extra context. You don't need to watch it but I thought it was a pretty fun addition to the world.</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 gets fixes for Steam Deck and now works offline</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>World of Goo 2 from 2D BOY / Tomorrow Corporation has a small update that's been released, cleaning up some issues reported by players and making it run better on Steam Deck. The game came to Steam and other stores on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/world-of-goo-2-is-out-now-on-steam-and-a-great-pick-for-puzzle-game-fans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">April 25th and it's really great</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The May update for the game highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Offline mode.</li>
<li>Sound initialization.</li>
<li>Steamdeck fixes.</li>

<p>Turns out, the game <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3385670/discussions/0/601902918586626263/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wouldn't work</a> if you had Steam set to offline mode. Now it will. Just a nice little fix for players on handhelds.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue working towards a stable release of the major Proton 10 update, to bring many improvements to Windows game compatibility on Linux / Steam Deck. Today, Valve released a small bug fix update to the Proton 10 Beta.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updates-to-proton-10-with-fixes-for-marvel-rivals-oblivion-remastered-and-more-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Experimental was also recently updated to use Proton 10</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the latest changes in Proton 10.0-1d (beta):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<p>Since it's a build your own deal, you get a bigger discount for adding more into your cart starting from 2+ for £5, 4+ for £4.50 and all of it for £3.12 per item. So altogether you can get the entire thing for about £25.</p>

      <title>Valve rolls out SteamVR 2.10 with quick recenter, reduced controller and physics jitter and Linux fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest stable version of SteamVR with 2.10 bringing a few fixes and a couple of new features to improve the experience. Nice to see Valve putting a few little improvements for Linux VR fans too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All the changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quick recenter now available system-wide via system button long press.</li>
<li>Improved automatic throttling behavior. Reduces controller and physics jitter from throttling and prediction changes in response to performance variations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>OpenXR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Better handling of non-pipelined applications. Reduces controller jitter for Unity OpenXR apps.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed empty black window when starting SteamVR on Linux.</li>
<li>Added window icons to SteamVR windows on Linux.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Developer Options</strong>

<li>Removed remaining legacy 32-bit executables, including: vrmonitor, vrstartup, restarthelper, overlay_viewer.</li>
<li>Fix UI launching of overlay_viewer.</li>
<li>overlay_viewer gets better pan / zoom / resize support, and other misc improvements.</li>
<li>performance improvements to IVRChaperone ()-&gt;GetBoundsColor().</li>

<p>For those of you doing SteamVR on Linux, leave a comment on how you're finding the experience at the moment.</p>
<p>I just recently moved my office around, and finally mounted my second SteamVR Base Station for my Valve Index onto a wall instead of resting on a unit. And made some extra space for a bit more room, so hopefully I'll be doing a lot more VR soon. Although, I do hope whatever the Deckard ends up being doesn't need the Base Stations as it would open it up for a lot more people. And, especially, if it will use Linux like we've seen leaked for a standalone mode, my high hope there is that Valve are sitting on some bigger SteamVR improvements for Linux to come.</p>

      <title>Playtron wanted to take on Windows and SteamOS with their GameOS, now they&#39;re announcing a cryptocurrency</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reading the press release sounded like a late April Fools joke, but I think we all saw where Playtron were heading. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally announcing PlaytronOS</a> (now GameOS), their Linux-powered gaming system, they're now directly moving into crypto.</p>
<p><em>Because of course they are and to the surprise of no one I think.</em></p>
<p>They've previously released a few Alpha builds, gathering funding from a few investors (like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/square-enix-invests-in-playtron-for-their-linux-based-playtronos-first-alpha-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square Enix</a>) and talked a lot of big talk to the point that I'm sure some people were originally excited about Playtron — somewhere out there anyway. Especially considering they pulled in developers working on various popular open source stuff like Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, ChimeraOS, Box64 and others. However, this continued crypto nonsense makes me continue to believe it won't go anywhere outside of the crypto-bro crowd.</p>
<p>They're calling it Game Dollar, a "stablecoin" that will be used in GameOS to power purchases, subscriptions, and rewards across Playtron "and other gaming ecosystems in the future". And this goes back directly to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">incredibly weird web3 SuiPlay0x1 handheld</a> that will ship with Playtron's GameOS. They're doing this with support from the stablecoin platform <a href="https://www.m0.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">M0</a> and payments platform Bridge.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Playtron's GameOS reimagines how we play the games we love. Through this lens it became clear: stablecoins will become a financial backbone for the $500B global gaming economy. That’s why Playtron is excited to announce Game Dollar, the stablecoin built for games and ready to handle massive transaction volume over the next decade,” said Kirt McMaster, co-founder and CEO of Playtron. “Game Dollar will unlock new economic models for developers and marketplaces while enabling consumer incentives only possible via programmable dollars.”</p>
<p>“Programmable stablecoins are the next evolution of digital assets, and Game Dollar is a powerful example of how this innovation unlocks utility for one of the world’s most dynamic sectors,” said Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs. “We’re witnessing the start of a new era where gamers not only play, but participate in dynamic, self-sustaining economies.”</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see Playtron harness M0’s universal stablecoin platform to reimagine the gaming payments experience in a unique way,” said Luca Prosperi, co-founder and CEO at M0. “This collaboration highlights the power of programmable money applied to real-world use cases, and our vision is that this is how the payments and rewards experiences of the future will look like.”</p>
<p>“Gaming is a global community, and financial access shouldn't be a barrier. With Bridge powering seamless entry and exit points for Game Dollar, we're making digital economies more inclusive for players—and radically simpler for developers,” said Zach Abrams, CEO at Bridge. “They get stable, ready-to-use payments infrastructure that takes care of compliance and enables a global reach out of the box.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>At this point, if you're interested in Linux gaming or any kind of alternative to Windows, you're going to be much better off looking elsewhere. Unless crypto is your thing, I guess. Like Valve's own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS when it eventually gets a public Beta</a>, or <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware vendors for PCs, handhelds and more, what are they going to pick? There's Microsoft's Windows, Valve's SteamOS, various other forms of Linux, or weird <em>crypto-fuelled</em> Linux? I really just cannot imagine a serious normal hardware vendor ever jumping in for this.</p>

      <title>Starless Abyss is a seriously cool Eldritch-themed space strategy deckbuilder out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My new favourite deck-builder? Could well be. Starless Abyss released late in April from Konafa Games and No More Robots blending together the worlds of Eldritch horror and deck-builders in a space strategy theme. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>I love deck-builders, strategy games and everything space sci-fi so this game is like a little dream for me. Blending together a little from the likes of Slay the Spire, FTL and Into the Breach for the mechanics and theme it's been a huge surprise that really deserves a lot more eyes on it.</p>
<p><em>Tested on Kubuntu Linux (25.04), it works perfectly with Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7799698821746537472gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Starting off like any good deck-builder you pick your captain, which comes with unique skills and off you go to fight off the Eldritch-themed space horrors that are breaking down reality and causing all sorts of trouble. Then we get to the satisfying gameplay loop where you pick between locations to travel, each with their own different rewards and engage in turn-based card-based combat.</p>
<p>During combat you'll position your ships around a grid each turn, and then play various cards that each have a different energy cost (energy is replenished each turn). What I really liked for the battles is that cards can be used by any ship in your fleet, but ships <em>individually</em> build up heat and so might be unable to use certain cards. It's up to you to balance the heat on each ship and thankfully there's cards that can reduce the heat build up, which also goes down each new turn too.</p>
<p>As you face off against the space horrors and destroy them, they don't just get removed from the grid. They'll leave a floating carcass which will block movement and line of sight, so you need to deal with that too. Positioning really is important. Being able to hover over a ship and see what enemies plan is also a nice touch, something I'm glad other games took from games like Slay the Spire so you can keep planning ahead but it doesn't make it easy.</p>
<p>The events system is a unique one here too. You get special Dice (D.I.C.E), which allow you to bend reality to increase your odds during the events. They won't guarantee you get everything though, and they're a limited resource, but a sweet tweak for an events system.</p>
<p>You get to upgrade your fleet as the game goes on too. There's a shipyard where you can buy new ships to replace one of your current set and each with their own amount of movement, armour, heat and health. Add to that the relics system, where you can give each ship their own set of special buffs (like giving all near ships a shield every turn) and there's a lot of room to really change your play-through on every run.</p>
<p>Another quite clever addition are the Ritual cards. These powerful one-time bonus cards allow you to do certain actions but they come with a cost. They cause other cards to <em>malfunction</em>, which is a nuisance, but they're often necessary for survival and the malfunctions only last for the current combat.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vFmuGZQGKPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15866a95e4ed4d730ea24751394daefb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vFmuGZQGKPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Awaken a Proxima with unique skills and downfalls to help you to take on the horrors.</li>
<li>Command a fleet of upgradable ships across the universe.</li>
<li>Make pivotal decisions when encountering obstacles between combat, which could help boost or decapitate your run.</li>
<li>6 different factions of cards can be combined, collected and combo-ed to defeat the horrors in your own way.</li>
<li>Control your fate using D.I.C.E to increase your chances of survival during random encounters</li>
<li>Embrace the occult using ritual cards to powerfully destroy and beat the competition.</li>
<li>Earn credits to buy and upgrade your cards•Unlock artifacts on your run to transform your ships powers•Unlock multiple different Proxima’s, each with their own unique set of skills and downfalls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really crispy pixel art mixed with some great turn-based combat, a thoroughly weird but interesting premise all wrapped up in some pretty cool tunes. Love it. Absolutely worth getting.</p>
<p>It's out now and there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450230/Starless_Abyss_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">also a demo</a>.</p>

      <title>Horror adventure ASYLUM updated for Steam Deck and on the way to being Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Senscape continue to tweak their supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM, with a recent update making a few changes to be on the way to getting it Steam Deck Verified. Also, the developer is still working on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Back in April the developer noted in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/230210/view/564746584593531844" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> that they fixed a "softlock in the morgue" for players using Proton but it's a "temporary patch while we keep working on the native Linux/Steam Deck version". While work on that continues, they also just released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/asylum/announcements/detail/501698013135110643" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another</a> patch over the weekend to improve it overall on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Latest patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New: Now fully <strong>Playable</strong> on Steam Deck! Only a few tweaks left related to font sizes to get the coveted <strong>Verified</strong> status next.</li>
<li>New: Full controller support validated! Moving the cursor during close-ups with a gamepad should feel much smoother now.</li>
<li>Fix: Greatly improved detection of a connected gamepad to properly show tutorials and input tips.</li>
<li>Fix: Menu settings wouldn't properly detect fullscreen status. Now they do.</li>
<li>Fix: A non-essential transitional cutscene late in the game was missing following a previous fix. It has been reinstated in all its cutscene-y glory.</li>
<li>Fix: Also, 2 frames were fixed in the aforementioned cutscene. No idea what this means, I'm going to trust the changelist on this one.</li>
<li>Fix: That puzzle in the topmost floor still had a few issues involving the timing of certain sound effects. No more.</li>
<li>Fix: Annoyingly, the head bobbing effect persisted while the menu was opened, making it difficult select stuff. Luckily for you, we are now sparing this annoyance.</li>
<li>Fix: Increased tab size in notepad, which is specially useful for the Steam Deck. No, it wasn't you and you don't need glasses, the text was indeed too small.</li>
<li>Fix: Fonts scale better now in lower resolutions, including the menu. Again, another win for Steam Deck!</li>
</ul>

      <title>BULLET YEETERS is an upcoming miniature-mayhem toy-scale PvP fragfest </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm always on the lookout for a good online shooter that works well on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck and BULLET YEETERS is high up on the list of games that could be great. A shooter of miniature mayhem, with a toy-scale with you and others running around big rooms across various game modes.</p>
<p>The developers say clearly it will support Steam Deck, and the PR email mentioned "native Steam Deck support" (which I've asked for clarification on). More details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bullet Yeeters pays tribute to a classic trope in competitive shooters - shrinking its cast down and turning any messy room into an ever-shifting battleground. With beefy guns and a wide cast of characters with their own powers to turn the tide, it’s not just the bullets that are getting thrown around here. Yeet yourself into action with Bullet Yeeters’ funky-fresh jetpack mechanics. Blast into the air at any point, pick your landing spot and launch to high shelves, dense cover or straight in your opponent’s face for a friendly buckshot greeting!</p>
<p>Bullet Yeeters is designed to be accessible to players of all skill levels, starting with gentle bot-matches to get newcomers on their feet, then escalating into increasingly complex modes. There’s classic deathmatches (teams optional) with fast respawns, a tense battle royale where cover is life and keeping your partners on their feet is half the challenge. Oh, and who can forget that childhood favourite - the floor is lava! That garish carpet is now instant death, so make sure you tread carefully, or shove enemies into it for a spicy surprise.</p>

      <title>Fight off a planet-wide fungal catastrophe in the upcoming co-op shooter Mycopunk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer Pigeons at Play and Devolver Digital, Mycopunk is one of those games where you see a few seconds of footage in the trailer, get totally sold and instantly stick it into your wishlist. There's also a demo available to try.</p>
<p>Your ragtag gang of robot rejects have been hired by the universal megacorp SAXON for one last shot at profitable glory (and avoiding the scrap heap). You are the New Atlas Hazard Crew, a ramshackle squad of exterminators sent to uncover the mysteries behind a planet-wide fungal catastrophe. You get an arsenal of crazy weapons and power tools, and you get to supercharge them with what they're saying is a " one-of-a-kind grid-based upgrade system to create the ridiculous sci-fi super-weapon of your dreams". Yeah, I'm definitely 100% sold on this. I need it.</p>
<p>This looks like one of the absolute wildest shooters in terms of world and creature design I've seen for a while. Absolutely love the style of it and the action looks intense too. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nT4jTAMY7m8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba4f60f9ec566726fc6344d2ca13425b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nT4jTAMY7m8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I tested out the demo on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/proton-10-gets-a-first-beta-to-improve-game-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>, and it worked perfectly. Even if the trailer didn't sell me on it, the gameplay definitely would have. Chaotic, good fun and some really interesting game mechanics. Shooting enemies and watching them fall apart, and have pieces remain alive and be picked up by others, it's really something. This has quickly turned into one of my most anticipated games for 2025.</p>
<p>The developer said on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3247750/discussions/0/595147637711205628/#c595147637711214686" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> that they're "planning to get it steam deck ready for full release" too.</p>
<p>This is one to watch, could easily end up being the next big co-op shooter.</p>

      <title>Gears of War is getting a remaster with Gears of War: Reloaded releasing in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft / Xbox Game Studios and developer The Coalition have <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> Gears of War is getting a remaster with Gears of War: Reloaded. It's coming to Steam on August 26th priced at $39.99.</p>
<p>So not only are we getting a prequel with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gears-of-war-e-day-announced-and-its-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, but an upgraded edition of the first game. Nice!</p>
<p>Interestingly, from the Xbox announcement, Microsoft seem to have begun rebranding their PC gaming efforts a little bit. In the store / platform list they said it will be available on "Xbox Series X|S, <strong>Xbox PC</strong>, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation 5, and Steam, and arrives on day one with Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass".</p>
<p><em>Xbox PC huh?</em></p>
<p>As for what it will have: "Gears of War: Reloaded includes the full breadth of content from the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, delivering the most complete version of the original game to date. Players will gain immediate access to all post-launch downloadable content at no additional cost — this includes the bonus Campaign act, all multiplayer maps and modes, and a full roster of classic characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6707593961746521019gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A Microsoft Account is not required for it, without it you'll be able to do cross-play. However, they said if you sign-in you'll get cross-progression and cross-platform invites.</p>
<p>Features they said to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution.</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign.</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer.</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR).</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos.</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio.</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures.</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects.</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections.</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing.</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The only bit that really concerns me, is that the Steam page already notes it will use Easy Anti-Cheat. However, Microsoft did at least enable that in Halo Infinite and Halo: The Master Chief Collection so hopefully they will again for Linux Desktop / Steam Deck. You can see the status of more games with anti-cheat on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Junkyard Space Agency is a &#39;scrappier, multiplayer version&#39; of Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Junkyard Space Agency is an upcoming co-op space agency simulator that the developer said is like a "scrappier, multiplayer version" of Kerbal Space Program. It's being made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Here you build spaceships from parts you salvage. Whatever they may be including pipes, tanks, sheet metal, repurposed electronics. What you make might not look pretty but as long as it gets you into orbit - that's the main thing. It will be playable in online co-op or solo, where you will scavenge to survive and build up your space agency. There's a little survival game to it with your outposts needing supplies to keep going.</p>
<p>There's no trailer yet so here's some screenshots:</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://nullterm.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a> the developer notes they are "committed to releasing the game's codebase as open-source under a permissive license upon its first public launch. We believe that this project is much bigger than ourselves and that what's envisioned can only become a reality through the collective effort, knowledge, and skills of the community".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Realistic Spaceflight. A space simulation balanced between Newtonian physics and fun. Objects’ orbits are shaped by mass, velocity, and gravity. And more often than not, things explode on impact.</li>
<li>Unique Build Mechanics. Endless ways to build custom ships and bases — inside and out — using modular parts, just like a space-grade constructor.</li>
<li>Co-op or Single Player. Designed with multiplayer in mind, the game can be played on public or self-hosted servers, but also locally.</li>
<li>Persistent World. Players come and go, but the world lives on and keeps evolving. Spaceships and their crews continue flying along their trajectories, and bases operate autonomously — until the supplies run out.</li>
<li>Mod support. An open codebase with full support for modding parts, missions, and even core gameplay mechanics. From day one.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No release date yet but the Steam page notes it's planned for sometime in 2026. Seems like one that's well worth keeping an eye on.</p>

      <title>Warfare Legacy Collection remasters two classics Flash strategy games and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm certain plenty of readers will remember the Flash classics Warfare 1917 and Warfare 1944! They're back, better than ever and expanded with the Warfare Legacy Collection now available. <em>There's even full Native Linux support with the release.</em></p>
<p>You'll get to rally British and German troops to fight through the trenches of France in Warfare 1917. Choose between the U.S. forces or the German Wehrmacht in a strategic tug of war in Warfare 1944. There's a brand new expansion that was added for this release too with The Battle of the Bulge. Nice bit of gaming history here, even if you didn't play the originals these are worth blasting through to experience the strategic tug of war.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ue4PlmPnxB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8cd1c4615c0e53e51fd38c8643ea7d12.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ue4PlmPnxB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Unlike other real time strategy games here's it's not about building up a base, or running across a top-down map to capture points. It's a side-scrolling tug of war, where you need to keep gaining ground to complete each campaign as you wear down the enemy and take advantage. The key here is in the individual units abilities, along with the special support abilities you get to throw at the other side.</p>
<p>The game doesn't exactly give you an intro, or really explain properly what you have to do, but thankfully it's all pretty simple. It's all about watching the different lanes your troops run through. You'll be constantly reinforcing by sending in new squads across each individual lane as you build up resources. Overall, it's still simplistic, but worth jumping into if you like a few hours of action. It's fast and quite brutal.</p>
<p>"After starting the Warfare series in 2008, it feels good to revisit where it all started, and breathe new life into a project nearly 17 years after its initial release" said Chris Condon at Con Artist Games. "I can’t wait to see everyone storm the battlefields during next month’s launch."</p>

      <title>Zelda 64: Recompiled (Majora&#39;s Mask) adds modding support, texture pack support, optimizations and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zelda 64: Recompiled is a project to play The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask on modern platforms with many new features, enhancements and now modding support too. <em>The community project is not endorsed by Nintendo in any way and you need to own the original game to use this.</em></p>
<p>Something I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally wrote about back in May 2024</a>, as it's a really interesting one that uses the open source project N64: Recompiled to statically recompile N64 binaries into C code that can be compiled for any platform.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Version 1.2.0 has rolled out with some major improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Modding support has been added. Mods can be installed by dragging them onto the game window or by using the "Install Mods" button in the mod menu before starting the game. You can find many mods on the Thunderstore page at <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/</a>. More info can be found in the readme.</li>
<li>Texture pack support has been added. Texture packs are managed with the same menu as mods and installed in the same way. Some texture packs can be found on the thunderstore page linked previously.</li>
<li>MacOS is now supported via a Metal renderer. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dcvz" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@dcvz</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tanmaysachan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@tanmaysachan</a>!</li>
<li>Many graphical optimizations have been added to improve performance on lower end GPUs.</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks and improvements.</li>
<li>A flatpak has been added for the Linux version. Please note that the AppImage has been removed due to some file picker issues it had.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">N64: Recompiled</a> also just recently released the Recomp Mod Tool modding tool, which comes with binaries for Linux and Windows.

      <title>Road trip management RPG Keep Driving added controller support, working on being Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keep Driving is a road trip management RPG that I'm <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/keep-driving-is-a-refreshing-road-trip-management-rpg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite a big fan of</a>, and now I'll be able to relax a little more on my next run with the recently added controller support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Keep Driving is a management RPG about slowly making your way through a procedurally generated pixel art open world. Pick up hitchhikers with their own personalities and stories; upgrade, customize and repair your car. Solve challenges on the road using a unique turn-based ‘combat’ system, using your own skills and whatever’s lying around in the glovebox to make it through."</p>
<p>In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2756920/view/538852710067208281" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> May 1st the developer noted a bunch of extra content has been added, along with full controller support. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2756920/view/538852710067208317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow-up</a> post, they also noted it's hit over 100,000 sales and they're now hoping with the latest update they can get Valve to check it again and rate it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YfELKTLjsvI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2d2c3062901d37f93425a17ab86c1dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YfELKTLjsvI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Easy Delivery Co. is a strange and spooky delivery driving sim with a demo worth checking out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easy Delivery Co. from Sam C / Oro Interactive is a delivery driving sim that mixes together classic PlayStation styled visuals, with bouncing physics and a slightly spooky atmosphere. The developer recently put up a first demo, which works great on Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Easy Delivery Co., players take on the role of a delivery driver in a once-lively scenic mountain town now plagued by strange weather. Explore an ordinary town filled with odd secrets as you make deliveries and get to know its mysterious residents. Manage your energy, fuel, and temperature while navigating the challenges that come with each package."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1DgkeZBvKfc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e0d4b09db86f58a629da2f31199111d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1DgkeZBvKfc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a fun throwback with the style and gameplay, and one that really captured me. I'm keen to see more in the full game. The developer said "Nothing strange going on, no lore, nothing at all, we promise" — not sure I believe that somehow. What's really going on? I definitely need some more practice with it, after losing a few packages when flooring it and bouncing around.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from the full release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Earn money, buy drastically overpriced gas and uncover the quirks of this strange little town.</li>
<li>Take in the atmospheric scenery or blitz through the towns (road safety not required).</li>
<li>A quiet town, curious residents, and maybe a secret or two.</li>
<li>Unlock radio towers as you progress, each featuring tracks from Lo-Fi, Drum n Bass, and Jungle artists.</li>
<li>Local split-screen race mode with up to four players.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stellaris: BioGenesis and free 4.0 &#34;Phoenix&#34; update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A major day for Stellaris as the Stellaris: BioGenesis expansion has released, and the huge free overhaul patch 4.0 "Phoenix" has arrived. If you've been away a while, it looks like a great time to jump back in. This is probably one of the biggest updates to the game since release back in 2016.</p>
<p>Get an overview of the 4.0 update in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZfZcwnZrZf4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c296c4e19dd43e880a2d2ab5fa6745c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZfZcwnZrZf4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the new expansion, it sounds like quite an exciting one too. There's overhauled genetic ascension, new biological ships that evolve with your empire, a new player crisis path, three new origins, a new megastructure and more.</p>
<p>I think it may be time for me to have another run through it. Have a look at the expansion trailer below:</p>

<h3>4.0 ‘Phoenix’ Features​</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Planetary Economy rework</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planets produce and consume resources through Jobs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Districts provide Jobs based on their development.</strong></li>
<li><strong>District Specializations dictate what Job types are provided by Districts and what buildings may be built.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Buildings typically modify the output of the Jobs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Ruler Stratum has been renamed the Elite Stratum, to better differentiate them from the actual Empire Ruler</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Pop Groups &amp; Workforce</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pops are now grouped together based on Species, Strata, Ethics, and Faction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pop numbers have been increased by a factor of 100, allowing more granular manipulation of Pops by various systems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pops produce Workforce that fills up Jobs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A Civilian stratum has been added to represent the masses that do not generally contribute to the empire’s military economy.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Pop growth reworked</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>All Pop Groups on a planet have simultaneous growth every month following the existing Logistic Growth formulas.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Underrepresented pops are no longer given population growth bonuses.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fractional growth is not retained from month to month - if a Pop Group would have fractional growth, it has a chance to gain 1 pop that month based on that fraction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All migration is now handled through the auto-migration system rather than push and pull that previously affected pop growth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The minimum growth for small colonies has been removed. Early colonization will be reliant on migration from the empire capital.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Migration pacts now apply to auto-migration.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Empire Focuses and Timelines</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Empire Timeline keeps track of important milestones of a playthrough, available in a tab in the Situation log view.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Empire Focus Tasks introduces short and medium-term goals for players to strive for, and offers an alternative way of unlocking key technologies.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empires can choose between Conquest, Exploration, and Development as their primary Empire Focus, affecting what type of tasks are drawn.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Completing Tasks provides progress towards Guaranteed Technology unlocks that are considered critical for that playstyle.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task completion is retroactive and will award progress if drawn.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tasks may be discarded for a small cost in Unity.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Trade revamped into a standard resource</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade is now used as the Market currency.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Trade Routes system has been removed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trade Production and Policies are now available to Gestalt’s through Logistics Drones</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditions, buildings and districts that previously affected maintenance drones now affect logistics drones</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ships now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on whether they are docked (free), friendly space (reduced), neutral space (normal), or hostile space (expensive).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Larger ships have higher upkeep.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Juggernauts do not have logistical upkeep, and reduce the logistical upkeep costs for ships in their system by 75%.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planets now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade based on their local resource deficits.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local deficit costs vary based on the base market value of the resources.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trade Policies can set how much of your Net trade after logistics upkeep is converted into other resources.</strong></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Branch Office Refresh</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>All Branch office buildings have been reworked to provide more interesting jobs to their host planet, increase local trade value, and their output now scales with branch office value.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Branch office buildings are now all planet unique. The amount of building slots remains unchanged.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Branch offices can now be opened on other corporate empires.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All buildings now have an influence cost, doubled when building on another corporate empire.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Added new branch office buildings: the Industrial Subsidiary and the Private Security Company.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Criminal Syndicates can now establish commercial pacts, replacing their criminal buildings with the regular version. Regular buildings still provide a crime floor to the host planet if they are owned by a criminal empire.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Databank Game Library</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The main help button now displays the Databank where you can explore brief articles on many in-game concepts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>With this effort, many aspects of the game’s UI have been filled with concepts, helping new players understand core mechanics.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clicking an underlined link in the UI of a concept that’s in the Databank opens that article and filters other related articles.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The full external wiki is still accessible from a button in the Databank. Clicking it on the Databank start page opens the wiki start page. If a Databank article is selected, that article is opened in the wiki.</strong></li>

<li>The special project window pops up and can be started immediately after creating a new template if desired. It is no longer absolutely necessary as you can use integration to slowly convert your existing pops.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Habitable Worlds slider in game setup now has a 'Rare' setting. There will still be a handful of habitable worlds in the galaxy, mostly from special events and guaranteed habitable worlds. Normalized initializer spawn odds to use a handful of scripted variables.</li>
<li>Added galaxy precursor selection to game setup.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Leader positions now have a significantly greater effect on what traits will appear when they level up and gain a new skill.</li>
<li>Increased the base number of leader traits to pick from on level up by 1. This is intended to reduce the chance of getting exclusively poor trait options without devaluing other sources of leader trait picks too much.</li>
<li>Added an "Auto Select Leader Traits by Default" option to game settings, which defaults to Off. On game start or if you switch to an empire, it will toggle the setting on the Leaders tab to your selection. In Coop empires, this override only applies when the primary player of the country joins it. Changing the setting mid-game will not have any effect unless you switch countries.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Modding​</h3>
<ul>
<li>The actual script file and line are now printed when there are errors logged in scripted triggers and scripted effects, in addition to the previously available information.</li>
<li>Added job game text functionality to hook up with scripted job swaps. You can do job_key.XXX, Planet.job_key.XXX or Country.job_key.XXX, where XXX is GetName/GetNamePlural/GetIcon. (So e.g. "My miner name: [miner.GetName]")</li>
<li>City Sets no longer require Ships Sets to be defined, see Wilderness or Solarpunk as an example</li>
<li>Pop Groups:
	<ul>
<li>Added `create_pop_group` effect, use this instead of create_pop</li>
<li>kill_pop has been replaced with kill_pop_group. For ease of use kill_single_pop and kill_all_pop scripted effects have been made.</li>
<li>Add `transfer_pop_amount` effect that transfers pops from a pop group to another
		<ul>
<li>This is an incredibly flexible effect so in addition we have replaced all instance of resettle_pop (code) with resettle_pop_group (script effect).</li>
<li>Replaced all instances of pop_change_ethic (code) with pop_group_transfer_ethic (script effect)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The trigger num_pops is replaced by pop_amount since there are now 100 times more pops</li>
<li>Moved resource upkeep and production for pops from species archetype and traits to the resource tables for archetypes and traits, instead of them being part of the pop categories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jobs, Districts, Buildings, and Specializations
	<ul>
<li>Added tags to jobs, allowing us to easily group them for use in triggers num_pops_with_job_tag and num_country_pops_with_job_tag.</li>
<li>Districts now support a list of specialization slots defined in zone_slots = { }, these slots define which specializations are valid in this district.</li>
<li>If start = <specialization_name> is defined for a zone_slot, the specialization slot will automatically include this specialization.</specialization_name></li>
<li>Zone Slots have include = { } and exclude = { } lists, typically held in inline_scripts which define which specializations are valid in the zone slots</li>
<li>District specializations are built in zone slots inside districts and have building slots, defined by max_buildings = int</li>
<li>Valid buildings for district specializations are defined by using any of the included_building_sets, excluded_building_sets, include, and exclude lists. Note that exclusion takes precedence over inclusion.</li>
<li>Buildings must now belong to at least one building set.</li>
<li>District specializations also support district_planet_modifier and triggered_district_planet_modifier which are planet scope modifiers that are automatically scaled with the number of districts on the planet of the same type that the district specialization is in.</li>
<li>When a resource is spent to build a building or enact a decision, it is stored locally and can be accessed in script such as “on_queued” and “on_unqueued”, see Wilderness buildings for an example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biological Ships:
	<ul>
<li>Added a new scope "ship growth stage" or "growth stage" for short. Used for the sub-designs of stages that grow. Ship Designs contain everything that is true for all designs, while Growth Stages contain everything that's related to a specific Ship Size. Triggers have been updated.</li>
<li>Added the "add_evolution_progress" console command, that adds evolution progress to all bioships in a fleet.</li>
<li>You can now specify "growth_stage" in the "create_ship" effect to set the growth stage to use at creation (starts at 1)</li>
<li>Added bioship_can_grow trigger to evaluate if a bioship has the potential to get growth progress</li>
<li>Added target_focus parameter to ships and components to control if it focuses fire or spreads it among targets</li>
<li>Added on_hit effect for weapon component templates</li>
<li>Added repair_shield_percentage, repair_amount, repair_armor_amount, repair_shield_amount effects</li>
<li>Added the has_armor_percentage and has_shield_percentage triggers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Message Scripting:
	<ul>
<li>There is now an event_message_type in events that lets you override the default message type EVENT_MESSAGE_TYPE. This can e.g. provide separate message settings.</li>
<li>create_message target supports faction scope (clicking the message will open the factions view with that faction selected if it is listed).</li>
<li>create_message target supports federation scope (clicking the message will open the federation view if the player is in a federation).</li>
<li>Message notification background is now separated from the message type icon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Species Trait Tags:
	<ul>
<li>Species traits now support tags, similar to ship weapons. These are primarily used for the new triggers listed below as well as the new add_random_species_trait in the modify_species effect.</li>
<li>To see how this is used check the “add_random_trait_evopred” effect in the biogenesis_effect.txt file.</li>
<li>Added new field localized_tags to species traits used to show the corresponding categories in the trait tooltip</li>
<li>You can now add one or more `portrait_override` to trait, in case you want specific exceptions to the archetypes and species classes limiters. For example, if you wanted to make an egg laying, flat tailed, funny lookin, fast swimming, warm blooded duck billed web footed burrow digging p p p p p p platypus.</li>
<li>Added `species_class_override` and `archetype_override` triggers to trait. If those triggers return true, then the trait ignores the associated requirements (species_class or allowed_archetype)</li>
<li>Added "trait_has_all_tags" trigger that returns true if the trait in the scope has all the traits in the list</li>
<li>Added "trait_has_any_tag" trigger that returns true if the trait in the scope has at least one of the trait in the list</li>
<li>Added "trait_has_tag" trigger that returns true if the scope trait has the tag used for the trigger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>on_actions:
	<ul>
<li>Added the on_resolution_vetoed on action.</li>
<li>New on_action on_favor_gained that gets triggered when a country receives a favor.</li>
<li>New on_action on_research_option_added that gets triggered every time a new permanent research option is acquired.</li>
<li>Add on_ship_enter_fleet and on_ship_leave_fleet on actions</li>
<li>Added the on_resolution_put_to_vote on action</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Game Rules:
	<ul>
<li>Removed unused can_resettle_planet game rule and renamed can_resettle_planet_no_owner_check to can_resettle_planet.</li>
<li>Removed can_colonize_with_pop game rule and moved its checks to can_colonize_with_species.</li>
<li>Added should_leader_gain_trait_every_level game rule.</li>
<li>Added the species_has_uncapped_habitability_on_planet game rule, this sets the habitability ceiling for a species to use the HABITABILITY_CEIL_UNCAPPED define instead of the HABITABILITY_CEIL define</li>
<li>Created new rule can_uplift for species</li>
<li>Added the will_leader_survive game rule that replaces the leader death toast with a survival one.</li>
<li>Added the should_colonize_use_terraform game rule, used to get the behavior Wilderness has with terraforming</li>
<li>Added the should_hide_pop_group_size and should_hide_planet_sector_pop_amount which Wilderness uses to obfuscate the amount of pops on a planet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the script effect "copy_traditions_from = { target = FROM exceptions = { tradition1 tradition 2 } }" that copies tradition from a target country into the scoped country</li>
<li>Added "add_ascension_perk" and "remove_ascension_perk" effects, scope must be a country, adds or removed the specified perk syntax: add/remove_ascension_perk = perk_key</li>
<li>Added "copy_ascension_perks_from" effect: Copies the Ascension Perks of the target country into the scoped country. They are added to the existing perks, and the potential/possible triggers are respected. The perks listed in the exceptions list are not copied. copy_ascension_perks_from = { target = FROM exceptions = { perk1 perk2 } }</li>
<li>Added "remove_tradition" effect. Remove the target tradition from the scoped Country. remove_tradition = tradition_key</li>
<li>Added effect "remove_tradition_tree" Remove the target tradition tree from the scoped Country. remove_tradition_tree = tradition_category_key</li>
<li>Added spawn_design to static galaxy system data, which forces a specific design to spawn in the system.</li>
<li>Added gamesetup_settings script for configuring the settings list in game setup.</li>
<li>Scripted loc can now be used in concept tooltips and the top bar tooltips.</li>
<li>Added the used_defense_platform_capacity_percent trigger, letting you check how much of a starbases defensive platform capacity is used.</li>
<li>Added "playme" console command as shorthand for human_ai and ai_ignore_was_human.</li>
<li>Added auto_trait_prio support for planet classes</li>
<li>TerraformLinks resource block now has the planet as from scope</li>
<li>Added desc parameter to top bar multi-resource groups.</li>
<li>Added spawner_planet event target link for armies to replace the old pop link</li>
<li>Added parameter to Fallen Empire scripts to prevent using custom empire designs, see the Fallen Hive Empire for an example</li>
<li>Added parameter to force the spawning of neighbors on system initializers, see the Fallen Hive Empire for examples</li>
<li>Added support for leader class-specific skill level modifiers.</li>
<li>Added support for triggers in starbase_level pictures</li>
<li>Added "city_graphical_culture" triggers that test a given graphical culture (or that of a target scope) against the graphical culture used for the scoped country. If the target is also a country, it compares both the graphical cultures used for cities</li>
<li>Graphical cultures now have `ship_selection_weight` to calculate their chance of being picked by empires</li>
<li>The "graphical_culture" trigger now works on species (return the culture associated with the species class) and can take a target, so like "graphical_culture = FROM" will return true if 'this' and 'FROM' have the same graphical culture</li>
<li>You can now specify a global design when creating a starbase, but it only works for designable starbase size (ie the space citadel)</li>
<li>Orbital and Planet Deposits now support habitat_modifier, which as you might expect from the name, applies a static modifier to the habitat(s) in the system.</li>
<li>Added a update_node_portraits_if_gestalt_effect scripted effects</li>
<li>Added documentation to the common/global_ship_designs directory</li>
<li>Added keyboard shortcuts to scripted actions</li>
<li>Support setting animation state from scripted action</li>
<li>Added support for the shipclass_military_special to use cloaking</li>
<li>Modifed Empire Creation so it can handle normal in-game triggers. Removed local_human_species_class and local_human_origin triggers that were used in this context.</li>
<li>dynamic_capacity can now be used for all resources not just those that use special_max_amount</li>
<li>Moved AI only origins into their own file</li>
<li>Added trigger parameter allowed_planet_classes_override to traits in order to override planet classes listed by allowed_planet_classes</li>
<li>Added ai_should_not_restrict_system game rule</li>
<li>Set ideal planets to also provide +100% Habitability so they work nicely with uncapped habitability</li>
<li>Allowed using custom tooltips for forbidden peace offers in war goals</li>
<li>Removed the "attraction_label" from the outliner UI to make more room for faction production.</li>
<li>added "system_modifier" and "triggered_system_modifier" to jobs to have modifiers that are transmitted inside the same system.</li>
<li>added "can_always_dismantle" flag to starbase levels to indicate a starbase type should always be destroyable</li>
<li>Added the inner_radius trigger to determine the size of the gravity well of a solar system</li>
<li>count_species_traits trigger now only filters by category when one is passed as a parameter</li>
<li>Since we build the citadel anywhere, we needed a way to set its position. the easiest way was to do it in code, so now when you've set a starbase in your megastructure, the code will generate it automatically. However the megastructure will not be destroyed by code, so if you want to do that you still need to do it manually.</li>
<li>build_outside_gravity_well flag in megastructures is deprecated, replaced with `build_type = inside_gravity_well/outside_gravity_well/around_planet` used to determine where and how to place a megastructure</li>
<li>Added scripted triggers for has_purity_ascension, has_cloning_ascension and has_mutation_ascension</li>
<li>Added the can_add_mutation_traits scripted trigger</li>
<li>Added is_purity_authority, is_cloning_authority and is_mutation_authority scripted triggers</li>
<li>Added the generate_new_species_and_pop scripted effect to quickly add new species and pops to a planet.</li>
<li>Unified all variants of the assorted plantoid and lithoid traits into single traits using the species_class_override parameter for species traits.</li>
<li>Added the colony_age_years trigger</li>
<li>Updated thrusters, FTL Drives, Cloaking Devices, Ship Reactors, Combat Computers and probably more to use scripted triggers</li>
<li>Added custom_tooltip_with_modifiers support to starbase buildings and modules</li>
<li>Added the upgrade_path parameter to ship components. For core components, components that have the same upgrade path are shown on the same row</li>
<li>The "end" value of a Situation stage is now a scriptable value instead of just an int. It's evaluated when the situation is spawned, and then stays at that value for the duration of the situation</li>
<li>Added Planet as a possible scope for the `has_deficit` trigger</li>
<li>Added the "damage_army" effect</li>
<li>You can now restrict civics and origins by graphical cultures by using the "graphical_culture = { <restriction> }" restriction in possible or potential. It works like every other civics/origins restriction.</restriction></li>
<li>Added "add_random_species_trait" to modify_species, which takes a trigger that's applied to all the possible species traits, and randomly adds one that fulfills the trigger.</li>
<li>Added definition for invisible extra large turret</li>
<li>Added a country_uses_bio_ships scripted trigger</li>
<li>Technology Swap can now change the Area and Categories of the tech. For example, Corvettes (engineering, voidcraft), can become Brawlers (Society, Biology).</li>
<li>Added a ruined_icon parameter to planet buildings allowing them to produce a different icon when destroyed</li>
<li>Added planet_building_capacity_add, allowing planets to function like starbases producing multiple things at the same time</li>
<li>Static Modifier Custom Tooltips can now have parts of their localization designated to be multiplied when a static modifier is applied. This allows for modifiers such as defensive_stations_tracking_add to be defined entirely in script</li>
<li>Origins can now be given a room and city_graphical_culture argument to automatically change the players designs when the origin is selected. The AI should respect this too.</li>
<li>The resources that appear in the top bar are now scriptable and conditional. See how Wilderness handles the Consumer Goods/Biomass swap as an example</li>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds currents, bioluminescence, additional environmental events and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a big release for the open source evolution sim Thrive, with some major new features being added to the latest release of this scientific survival game. I really love watching this game evolve, it has some really fun and unique ideas that we've not seen in such a game before and every update like this greatly expands it.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access with Thrive 0.8.2 bringing in some big features like currents, so you and other cells will be pushed around a bit more, along with some moving water particles being added for a bit of visual flair. Currents change and push other things so the game is a fair bit more dynamic.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of new events that have been added like glaciation events and meteor impacts and they've overhauled the tutorial to prevent some player confusion. My favourite addition though? Bioluminescence! They said it's been on their list to add in for a long time, and it's finally in, so you can make yourself look pretty.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sl1k6tzvufQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b8a2726cc291e51c27538cce50e586d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sl1k6tzvufQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some more of what was added includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More polished environmental tolerances with organelles now affecting the tolerances.</li>
<li>Added resolution scaling options to render at lower resolutions for more performance.</li>
<li>Added a loading screen for stages during which graphics are loaded and shaders compiled to reduce stuttering during gameplay.</li>
<li>Upgraded to Godot 4.4.1.</li>
<li>Added a button to play the game at double speed.</li>
<li>Reordered the organism statistics panel to put less important stats at the bottom and make the compound balances visible without scrolling down.</li>
<li>Balancing tweaks and made AI members of the player species dying affect the population.</li>
<li>Various graphics and GUI tweaks.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Glass Cannon is my next indie obsession, a chill turn-based shoot-em-up roguelike with wild weapon combos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I cannot stop myself clicking play on Glass Cannon, it's a properly great and unique shoot 'em up experience that twists the genre in a fun way that's too easy to get obsessed with. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The game gives you a small arena with a set amount of enemies you need to destroy. The problem is, you only have a limited amount of shots before the enemies will come at you to potentially destroy you and it's game over. Thankfully, there's no urgency here, since it warps the genre into a turn-based strategic roguelike where you get to build up a deck of weapons and over-power them into some ridiculous builds.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17547616101746276147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17547616101746276147gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After each round (if you survive) you get credits depending on kills and number of shots used. Or any little money orbs you also manage to shoot through and collect. You then use this to buy weapon mods that can have serious game-changing abilities, along with spinning a weapon wheel to either upgrade a current weapon or acquire another.</p>
<p>In a way, it reminds me of games like Balatro. Especially with the UI design, and how it takes a genre and refreshes it along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/help-ive-discovered-nubbys-number-factory-a-plinko-style-roguelike-where-you-stop-the-sun-exploding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nubby's Number Factory</a>, for the sheer craziness of it along with the shop system.</p>
<p>The shop and upgrade system is where the game really shines. Each weapon you get has a certain amount of slots to build them up with modules. These module upgrades can be pretty awesome that add abilities to weapons like zapping other enemies near the bullet, increasing the size of the bullet, sending out spikes if you get hit, cloning itself and … you get the idea. My personal favourite weapon module is the Brawler, which spawns a brawler that jumps at enemies when the projectile is destroyed.</p>
<p>Some of these modules can even be stacked together, so you can really add up to some hilarious weapon builds.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7852289601746276810gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7852289601746276810gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What also makes it interesting, is that you cannot move unless moved by a weapon or another object. Add to that the different types of weapons like a grappling hook that hits enemies and moves you to the last position of it, a cutting disc that will slice through many enemies (and you if you're unlucky), a grenade that explodes, a rocket that will push you back as you fire but it moves slowly and more. <em>There's a lot of ways you can mix and match things.</em></p>
<p>Really a challenge to get through it too, mostly due to the limited amount of shots you get on each round. Different types of enemies require more power and often multiple hits, along with certain enemies having special effects that can mess with you that you need to learn. It's all about the bouncing. Each weapon has a different amount of times they will bounce off of enemies and the walls, so you need to maximise what you do. In that way, it also ends up feeling a bit like playing shoot 'em up version of cue sports.</p>
<p>Thankfully, even when you don't manage to kill all the enemies, it's only game over if their combined hits to you reduce your HP to zero, otherwise you just automatically heal before the next round.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LTWk9NP8USI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c16d5cd41f02271afee2f867769885f3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LTWk9NP8USI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer isn't quite finished with it, promising some new types of cannons for you to start with, along with other types of arenas, all of which I'm incredibly keen to see.</p>
<p>I really have been completely hooked by it. I cannot think of another game like this and I am surprised to see that it's being so overlooked because it's such a brilliant idea. Developer LisiSoft is really onto something special here and I think you absolutely have to make this your next game. This is all I'm going to be playing for a while. I need my next hit.</p>
<p>Out now with Native Linux support. It works perfectly on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) and on Steam Deck too. There's no controller support, but the controls are so ridiculously simple that Steam Input makes it a non-issue for Steam Deck. A great one to take with you wherever you go and whatever device you're on.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.7 released with an interesting loading time performance improvement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine 10.7 development release is out now, and in the highlights they noted an interesting sounding performance improvement for select games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights of the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>User fault fd support to improve write watches performance.</li>
<li>Support for Float format conversions in WindowsCodecs.</li>
<li>More work on the new PDB backend.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For that first bullet point, it comes from a <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/7871" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merge request</a> titled "ntdll: Use UFFD for tracking write watches when possible" from CodeWeavers developer Paul Gofman that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary motivation for this patchset is performance improvement. The issue was originally observed with Streets of Rage 4 game which was sometimes loading [levels] for about 1-1.5 min (while that was happening almost instantly on Windows). The performance problem is coming from .Net Core memory management / garbage collector code. That huge performance issue was caused not only by direct turnaround difference for write watched memory access but also by specifics of the [algorithm] which was using different memory pools / strategies [effectively] based on memory access timing and was resulting in especially unfortunate pattern hitting write-protected (for write watch) pages much more often than it normally would. Since then something has changed either in the game or in .Net Core it is using, and the difference in level loads is not that dramatic without this optimization, but still it is some 6-8 sec without this patch instead of 1.5-2sec with this patch or on Windows, suggesting that it still provides a huge performance improvement at least for .Net Core memory management.</p>

      <title>Pac-Man meets a time-stopping survivor-like bullet heaven in Maze Mice out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Maze Mice is the latest game from the developer of the popular Luck be a Landlord, and while many developers continue making their own form of Vampire Survivor-like, this is probably the most unique so far that truly mixes things up as it feels a lot more like Pac-Man.<em> Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Not just a survivor-like meets Pac-Man but it also ends up a little like a reverse-Snake, as all the enemies start lining up in a big long line as they chase after you. The key here is to plan ahead, and pick what direction you're going to be running in to grab some XP orbs to unlock and upgrade more skills that auto-fire while you're moving.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it is not a race against time (well, not exactly) since it has a time-stopping mechanic where nothing happens unless you move.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xdejN8ANL2o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96b36c01fcc43baf081fa444ea48acd5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xdejN8ANL2o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I love the <em>idea</em> of it. I <em>really</em> do. Initially, I wasn't entirely sure if it had enough to hook me in for long. The game mechanics the developer has taken and put in a blender here are certainly a very weird and interesting combo, but I thought the time-stopping mechanic was actually working <em>against</em> it.</p>
<p>After you play more though, and survive for longer, you begin to understand why the time-stop mechanic is actually great. Even with you able to just stop everything, there's still a surprising urgency to it, especially when you've repeatedly managed to back yourself into a corner and you're on your last little bit of HP.</p>
<p>Still, I would really like to see more dynamic elements and events on the map to just spice things up a bit more, and help it have some more staying power for the long run. As I've progressed through, I've enjoyed unlocking more abilities to have another run through and see what weird combinations I can make. And I look forward to unlocking even more.</p>
<p>It's out now in Early Access, so it has only just begun life with the developer hoping to add in more upgrades, characters and stages.</p>
<p>“Seeing the love for Luck be a Landlord has really motivated me while working on my second commercial title, Maze Mice,” said Dan DiIorio, lead developer and founder of TrampolineTales. “I can’t wait to watch everyone skitter through mazes, achieve high scores, and unlock cheesy upgrades!”</p>

      <title>The UPERFECT UColor O2 is a brilliant portable monitor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently having the chance to review the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/the-uperfect-umax-24-is-a-gorgeous-addition-to-any-desk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather large UPERFECT UMax 24</a>, the team at <a href="https://uperfect.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UPERFECT</a> sent over the much more portable 16 inch <a href="https://uperfect.com/products/16-inch-3k-oled-120hz-monitor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UColor O2</a> for me to take a look over.</p>
<p>In terms of portable monitors, if you're after something that's easy to carry around, this is an excellent feature-filled all-rounder. To ensure that I gave it a thorough look, I've been using it constantly over the last month and I've really come away impressed by the durability of it as well as how gorgeous it is overall.</p>
<p>Compared with the UMax 24, the one quality-control issue I had with the UMax were the wobbly side buttons for interacting with the on-screen controls and swapping inputs. Thankfully, the UColor O2 doesn't have this issue, the buttons feel nice and solid.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9379547871746203244gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Arriving with everything you need out of the box to get you going you'll get the monitor, a kick-stand cover, 2 x USB-C to USB-C Cable, 1 x Mini HDMI to HDMI Cable, a power adapter and screws for mounting. It's has VESA-compliant holes all ready if you decide to mount it somewhere.</p>
<p>Everything worked as expected, and using my Steam Deck LCD once again as the testbed for it, there hasn't been a single issue. Absolutely perfect, and games look <em>fantastic</em> on it. The image quality is great, remaining exceptionally clear at various angles.</p>
<p>With the on-screen display there's a blue light filtering option which goes across 4 levels, so if you need to tone it down to save your eyes you can. You also get access to change the brightness, contrast, eco mode, DCR and sharpness. On top of that you can change black levels, hue, saturation and colour temperatures to get it exactly where you want it for maximum comfort.</p>
<p>Considering how thin it is, and how much I travel between locations a fair bit nowadays (along with multiple small people running around), the durability and feel of it has impressed me. And uh — sorry UPERFECT, that includes it being fully dropped 5 or 6 times (probably more…) without it causing a problem. It's truly a rock solid device. I'm not going to suggest you go throwing it around, but it's good to see a portable actually be portable between locations, moving around bags and being <em>dropped</em>.</p>
<p>I am especially a big fan of the magnetic cover it comes with, which doubles up as a stand making it easy to set it up wherever you go. All together, this is now my go-to whenever I'm moving around because it's just so easy to slot into a bag and off you go while being fully featured.</p>

<p>Even when I'm at home and not travelling about, the UColor O2 has made break-time even better at my desk just quickly flicking it on and picking up a gamepad. As much as I <em>love</em> the Steam Deck, and I <em>love</em> getting away from my desk with it, I've actually found myself playing a lot more at my desk with it since I can get a bigger quality screen, with a lighter gamepad in hand while also keeping an eye on the unrelenting barrage of emails that have been coming in lately.</p>
<p>A little gripe with it is the same as the UMax, I just wish the speakers were that little bit louder, but still good enough for a portable monitor. Additionally, the on-screen UI for adjusting settings is annoyingly fiddly to work with, as is the case of basically every monitor ever. I saw my face in screen way too often after accidentally turning it off. Once you get used to the buttons though it makes sense with certain buttons mapped for quick-access to brightness, volume and video input with another button going into the full menu of all the options.</p>
<p>If you absolutely <em>require</em> a device that has a built-in battery though, you'll want to look elsewhere, as it does need to be directly powered. However, they <em>do</em> actually have another model (not tested) that has a built-in battery that's worth a look available at the same store link below as the O model (the O2 is what's tested here).</p>
<p><em>Thank you to UPERFECT for their trust in sending it over.</em></p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://uperfect.com/products/16-inch-3k-oled-120hz-monitor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">out on their store</a>. Priced normally it's £474.19 but they currently have it listed on sale for £263.44.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma drops LTS releases but will do extra bug fix releases, along with a new Steam-like hardware survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE developer Nate Graham has written up a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2025/05/01/notes-from-the-graz-plasma-sprint/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> detailing some planned changes coming to the KDE Plasma desktop, including doing away with the LTS (Long-Term Support) releases and instead extend the supported time for each release.</p>
<p>Instead of their not-so-great LTS releases where Graham admitted they were just backporting fixes "usually without even testing them", they're going to "lengthen the effective support period of normal Plasma releases a bit by adding on an extra bug-fix release, taking us from five to six".</p>
<p>They're also going to be thinking again on reducing the amount of Plasma releases a year from three down to two, which would allow them to better align with Kubuntu and Fedora releases. They will be discussing that again at the Akademy event in a few months time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9798146081746187873gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9798146081746187873gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - My KDE Plasma (Kubuntu) main desktop</em></p>
<p>On top of that KDE Plasma is moving away from QML-based theming, as it's "just inherently dangerous because QML is code; there’s not really a way to make QML theming safe", <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/3rd-party-kde-plasma-global-themes-and-widgets-can-lead-to-data-loss/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like the 2024 data loss issue</a>.</p>
<p>As for gathering data from users, they're also going to be changing how they do it, since they're collecting "very little data from people who have opted in (because it’s off by default)". What they're going to do is make the system work more like the Steam Hardware Survey, and show a box on the screen asking you to participate in the survey (with an option to disable it). Sounds like a good idea. Developers need data so they know where to focus.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the games to claim for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming for May 2nd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 2nd, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broke again on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, Valve updated Proton Hotfix to fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THE FINALS has a repeating issue where major updates will break it in some way, with the latest update causing the game on Desktop Linux / Steam Deck to freeze a few minutes into a match.</p>
<p>After numerous reports flowed in to the Proton GitHub page for it, Valve managed to find the cause of the problem and have released an update to Proton Hotfix to solve the freezing. Valve have also now set Proton Hotfix as the default for it, where it was previously set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13694374701746182865gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13694374701746182865gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you have manually set THE FINALS to a different Proton version, you should untick the compatibility box to let it automatically go to Proton Hotfix. More on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to change Proton versions in my guide</a>. If you don't have Proton Hotfix downloaded, it will automatically get downloaded on Steam when you go to launch THE FINALS. As long as you don't have a different version of Proton manually set on it.</p>
<p>Testing myself with Proton Hotfix today and a full match worked just fine.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 updated with a whole bunch of fixes thanks to the community having the source code</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve released the source code for Team Fortress 2 (TF2)</a> into the Source SDK, which allows modders to see how it all works and get their standalone mods onto Steam. But also, it allows them to fix up issues directly in Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>While not actually open source, as it uses Valve's non-commercial license, having the source there has resulted in lots of people submitting their own fixes. At time of writing, there's 375 open pull requests of the Source SDK GitHub, most of them coming in after the TF2 code was added to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15741915481746181235gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve have now bundled up some of the accepted code changes into the latest official release of TF2. Released on May 1st the changes are below, and you'll notice quite a lot are from community fixes:</p>

      <title>Epic reduce their cut to 0% for the first $1 million in revenue for devs on the Epic Games Store</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some interesting industry news for you here. Epic Games have announced a change to the revenue model of the Epic Games Store, as they try to pull in more developers and more gamers to actually purchase things.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on May 1st, Epic will take a 0% store fee for the first $1 million revenue developers make per app per year. After that, it goes back to their normal 88%/12% split.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this seems to be an expansion of their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/epic-games-launch-first-run-and-now-on-epic-with-100-revenue-for-devs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic First Run program they launched back in 2023</a>. For that though, developers had to be exclusive for at least six months. Seems this simply wasn't good enough, so now all developers will get it.</p>
<p>Not surprising they're doing this, when you see how player spending on third-party games on the Epic Games Store has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gone down two years in a row</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that they've also announced "Webshops" to release in June 2025 that enables developers to "launch their own webshops hosted by the Epic Games Store". This seems to be mainly a target for mobile by the sounds of it as Epic say it means developers can offer "out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees". People who use the Webshops will "accrue 5% Epic Rewards on all their purchases".</p>
<p>This was announced only a day after a judge ruled massively in Epic's favour against Apple (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the most played Steam Deck games for April 2025, Balatro still top but Oblivion Remastered sneaks in second</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new month is here, and something I haven't done recently is a look over what's been the most popular on Steam Deck. So here's what you've all been playing the most over the last month.</p>
<p>Most of the games here aren't exactly surprising, with a lot of them remaining in the top most played lists for months. <strong>Oblivion Remastered</strong> is an obvious new entry and not surprising to see people wanting to play it on Steam Deck. Although, the Verified status for Oblivion Remastered has caused many people to once again question how Valve have been testing, with the out of the box experience resulting in poor performance. If you've played it on Deck be sure to give your thoughts in the comments.</p>
<p>For April 2nd - May 1st, these were the 50 most played games on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Cozy mystery game Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping arrives in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping from Happy Broccoli Games is now set for release on May 22nd, and it will come with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The first game in the series, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam so clearly the developer is onto something with this. Hopefully the follow-up is just as good. It's a standalone adventure, so you don't need to have played the first.</p>
<p>More about it: "Duck Detective is back! Get ready to interview suspects, inspect evidence, and deduce the truth in another stand-alone mystery! This campsite might have ghosts, but the real thing haunting Eugene McQuacklin is his failed marriage and bread addiction. Can he escape the shadows of his past? To the annoyance of the Duck Detective, he is joined by a new partner in (solving) crime. Work together to unravel the truth and nibble on the crumbs of justice!"</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 release date now set for September 12, plus a new trailer and deep dive are out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K have announced that the release date for Borderlands 4 has moved up to September 12th and there's a new gameplay trailer to go along with it. Unless they stick in some kernel-level anti-cheat, I would expect this one to work just fine with Valve's Proton on Desktop Linux at least. Remains to be seen if the Steam Deck will be able to handle it.</p>
<p>Here's the new gameplay trailer below, which is from the PlayStation channel, as the one from the official Borderlands channel on YouTube is age-restricted so I can't embed it here. <em>I do hope YouTube one day solve that issue…</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T7miyMigr_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59143e05b2e25a2a1c597f124a500dee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T7miyMigr_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And then the deep-dive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0KlRBwf3sjY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ff489b7a69edceeb866a1ca64cc5fe4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the footage you'll get to see a first-look at two of the new four vault hunter classes. Vex the Siren is a powerful Siren who can empower herself or manifest deadly shades to fight alongside her, while Rafa the Exo-Soldier shines as a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of "digistructing" an arsenal of weapons. The developers say Borderlands 4 has "the most advanced skill tree system in a Borderlands game to-date".</p>
<p>2K said that Borderlands 4 will make it "easier than ever for friends to jump into co-op multiplayer with a new system for players to form parties online and stay together when switching game modes". It will also have "instanced loot for each player, dynamic level scaling, and individual difficulty to keep the party together and having fun through the whole campaign".</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Squirreled Away released back in March and looks absolutely adorable, and soon it will work better on Steam Deck with the developer working towards getting it fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>

While this update is primarily focused on behind-the-scenes work as we prepare for Steam Deck verification, we’ve also included a few bug fixes to improve your overall experience.

      <title>May 25 reminder - GamingOnLinux needs your direct support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome to May 2025 readers! Here's your little reminder that GamingOnLinux is primarily funded by readers - that's you! And as always we need <em>your</em> support.</p>
<p>We're coming up on 16 years in operation this July, which still feels pretty insane to actually write. Hopefully we can continue for another 16 and beyond! Thank you to everyone reading, commenting, sending in tips and leaving comments!</p>
<p><em>Want to help support GamingOnLinux? See below!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, the <em>best</em> way is regular support via<a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Patreon</a>. For Patreon, a <em>suggestion</em> is to pledge around the <em>start</em> of a month, as it charges at the beginning of <em>every</em> month (although that is changing at the end of this year to the date <em>you</em> started each month). Generally the Patreon is just to have <em>regular</em> funding to keep bringing you the news.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All other donations, <em>without</em> any special rewards can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=P85ZZX9W8HFMW" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paypal Donations</a> or Monthly donation/sub suggested levels: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-6MU983833N166101WL3ZRB5I" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter</a> - <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-54T30471MU837021GL3ZRCMY" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter Plus</a></li>

<p>You can find all the links to support us on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated page</a> any time.</p>
<p>Recently our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a> has expanded to allow you to report a change in status for games, and to submit suggestions to be added to it. The links to each anti-cheat vendor page were also updated to use the vendor name in the URL, instead of our own database ID to make them clearer, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/vendor/BattlEye/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> for example. On top of that, you can even link people to a search on it like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/?search=Call+of+Duty#mainlist" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>, and we're listing games clearly that <em>only</em> work on Steam Deck now too.

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint hits Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam with a big new update live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from Trese Brothers has another huge update out now, and players are enjoying the game so much it's now hit an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it? Imagine a cyberpunk version of XCOM where you build up a team to go on heists. The latest major update to the game added in the Face class tree, expanding the game with another 16 new Talents to manipulate the underworld, contacts, safehouse and team.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new class the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyber Knights is a game about building your rep and connections to get access to richer but riskier opportunities, navigating competing demands from your squad, faction power players, and long-term goals while you keep walking further along the knife-edge of pursuing big scores and keeping your squad able to handle it. Now the Face can give you more control over how you pursue that path. For example, <strong>Co-Conspirator</strong> will let you get missions from specific Contacts you want to work with while <strong>Dealmaker</strong> will let you strengthen ties with specific faction types to increase both your and your Contacts rewards for completing heists.</p>
<p>Your Face is a master of the underworld, deploying talents to manipulate the strategic layer of the game. Their place is at the Safehouse, and unlike other <a href="https://cyberknightswiki.tresebrothers.com/Classes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">character classes</a> in the game, they never join in missions or enter into combat - they hang back, play a mission overwatch role, and work the shadows. Using <strong>Care and Feeding,</strong> your Face can reroll options you don't like from your mercenaries' Limit Breaks and using <strong>Puppetmaster</strong> your Face can push a Contact with an Influence Limit Break to upgrade <em>all</em> of their services in a single go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're getting close to the full launch now, which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/cyber-knights-flashpoint-the-cyberpunk-xcom-like-hits-full-launch-on-may-15/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supposed to come on May 15th</a>, but they recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/643559577714951408" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a> it to June 2nd which I missed, but it's given them time to continue to ensure it's a good one.</p>
<p>See the latest trailer below, just keep in mind the newer release date for June 2nd:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5cumHBWrUGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77c189eb3f9c18113cefc258f40434f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5cumHBWrUGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>felix86 is a new open source Linux emulator to run x86-64 Linux programs on RISC-V processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RISC-V fans will be interested in this one. felix86 has been announced as a new project with a first release available that enables you to run x86-64 Linux programs on RISC-V processors on Linux.</p>
<p>Their aim with the project is to get many games working with good performance, and <a href="https://felix86.com/compat/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">some do</a> already fully work but there's still lots of work to do. Some of the games that already work with it include Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment, Baba Is You, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, Don't Starve, World of Goo, Celeste, Balatro, VVVVVV and SuperTuxKart.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>felix86 emulates an x86-64 CPU running in userspace, which is to say it is not a virtual machine like VMware, rather it directly translates the instructions of an application and mostly uses the host Linux kernel to handle syscalls.</p>
<p>Currently, translation happens during execution time, also known as just-in-time (JIT) recompilation. The JIT recompiler in felix86 is focused on fast compilation speed and performs minimal optimizations. It utilizes extensions found on the host system such as the vector extension for SIMD operations, or the <code class="inline-code">B</code> extension for emulating bit manipulation extensions like BMI. The only mandatory extensions for felix86 are <code class="inline-code">G</code>, which every RISC-V general purpose computer should already have, and v1.0 of the standard vector extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty awesome. Love seeing more projects like this across different hardware.</p>

      <title>Evil Dead: The Game gets delisted only 3 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Evil Dead: The Game from Saber Interactive / Boss Team Games, LLC is getting delisted from all stores (Steam purchases are already gone), although you will be able to continue playing it if you wish.</p>
<p>Short a few days from being released for three years, and only two years since the Steam release, this goes to show the complicated situation with licensed games. They already stopped live updates for the game back in September 2023 and cancelled a Nintendo Switch version (<a href="https://x.com/EvilDeadTheGame/status/1704239249761906859" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a>), so the writing was on the wall for this to happen.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts. Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game has Easy Anti-Cheat, although not stated on the Steam page, and going by the latest <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1493750?device=any" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> report it doesn't seem to currently work on Linux.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an active similar game that works on Linux / Steam Deck, I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dead by Daylight</a>. See more games on our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>EA and Codemasters no longer making WRC (World Rally Championship) or any other rally games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA and Codemasters announced today that they're putting the WRC (World Rally Championship) series on hold, and will no longer be making any games in the series. This follows the news that EA's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-cancels-multiple-projects-from-apex-and-titanfall-developer-respawn-with-more-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Respawn cancelled a couple of future projects</a> and let staff go too.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EA website the statement reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Rally Community,</p>
<p>Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announce that we've reached the end of the road working on WRC.</p>
<p>After releasing EA SPORTS WRC in 2023, the 2024 season, including the recently released Hard Chargers Content pack, will be our last expansion.</p>
<p>For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players. We hope it remains a source of joy, excitement, and the thrill of rally racing. We've poured our hearts into making it for fans, and we know you'll keep the passion alive.</p>
<p>Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DiRT. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.</p>
<p>The Codemasters WRC Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shame to see another series get cut.</p>
<p>Although, not that it directly affects Linux Desktop, Steam Deck and SteamOS since EA's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently re-branded EA Javelin Anticheat</a> that was added to EA SPORTS WRC entirely blocks Linux platforms anyway. You can see the status of more games that have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat on our compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app adds Cyberpunk 2077 as a supported game, improves Stardew Valley modding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Great day for modders. The newer in-development open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app has promoted Cyberpunk 2077 to supported status, making it easier to get modding across Linux (and Steam Deck).</p>
<p>The 0.10.2 version release also improves the experience for modding Stardew Valley with mods that don't have a manifest file, and there's also now draggable load order view for Cyberpunk 2077 REDmods.</p>
<p>Currently the only "supported" games out of the box are Stardew Valley and now also Cyberpunk 2077, with other games behind an experimental toggle button. For the newly supported Cyberpunk 2077, Nexus say they're "confident that we've got all the basics in place for players to mod Cyberpunk 2077 with the app".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For Cyberpunk 2077 the app features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with the Steam and GOG Galaxy releases on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Support for the most common types of mod: REDmod, archives, REDscript, and framework mods such (e.g. Cyber Engine Tweaks).</li>
<li>Support for collections</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics for missing dependencies.</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics to help set up a Linux environment to mod the game.</li>
<li>REDmod Load Order management and deployment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7099484331746017193gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some other changes included in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>More Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>When starting the app for the first time, the welcome, data consent, and log in messages have been combined into a single pop-up.</li>
<li>Stardew Valley - We've updated the installation logic to better recognise mods that do not include a manifest file - including translations and asset replacers.</li>
<li>Implemented new toolbar designs across the app.</li>
<li>Added empty state for collections with no required mods.</li>
<li>Reduced the size of all buttons in the UI for better use of space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed the Xbox Game Pass (Microsoft Store) experimental toggle because it currently isn't functional for any game.</li>
<li>The version number of the app will now be shown as 3 places, rather than 4. (e.g. 0.10.0, not 0.10.0.0)</li>
<li>Installers that don't support an archive now provide a reason in the logs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the text alignment in the "Delete mods" pop-up.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue caused by folder names with trailing whitespace characters.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where FOMODs with paths could cause the app to crash.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the app would crash when view FOMOD images in a certain way.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a collection could not be installed without applying the loadout at least once.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the app would show an error message if the game/tool it launched returned a non-zero exit code (e.g. REDmod).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the app would sometimes not back up game files correctly when replaced by files from mods.</li>
<li>Fixed collections download pages opening inside the wrong game.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Epic Games release of Cyberpunk 2077 is detected but not supported.</li>
<li>The app will attempt to run the REDmod.exe even if it is not installed, resulting in an error message.</li>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually this will replace Vortex and be the go-to modding platform for Nexus. Especially nice that this time around it has full Linux support.</p>
<p>For Linux / Steam Deck you can download the AppImage from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.10.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub release</a>.</p>

      <title>COMBOLITE is a unique physics deck-builder where you build up combos to keep hitting a rock</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably the absolute weirdest deck-builder I've ever played, COMBOLITE is all about repeatedly hitting a rock to score points and activate special combos to score even more points.</p>
<p>You build up a deck of various different weapons and items, all of which have different attack powers and bonuses and attack in a specific direction. The key is in the positioning of all the items in your deck, as some will activate their bonuses based on what weapon or item came before. Add to that special powers you get that only activate when a sequence of attacks from specific positions are done in a row. It's thoroughly weird and unique but I love the idea.</p>
<p>Much like other games that have you go for points including Balatro, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/ballionaire-is-annoyingly-good-and-i-want-to-play-it-all-the-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ballionaire</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/help-ive-discovered-nubbys-number-factory-a-plinko-style-roguelike-where-you-stop-the-sun-exploding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nubby's Number Factory</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/expand-and-rearrange-your-inventory-watch-numbers-tick-up-and-break-the-game-in-lootplot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LOOTPLOT</a> - you can really do some ridiculous stuff in it where you can get a truly insane amount of points in a single run. The developer said they've seen a player end up doing "13 BILLION damage in a single turn" and they're actively encouraging you to break the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h4itpZHUB4A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90affedb377676336fc3970385fb6ddb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h4itpZHUB4A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The rock itself just floats in the middle of screen but it has physics, and so the attack directions have various other important features since you'll be hitting it all over the place. For example, certain abilities you have acquired during a run might only activate if the rock hits the ground.</p>
<p>There's a lot of things to constantly think about that you're trying to balance here across all the buffs and abilities that keeps it really engaging.</p>
<p>COMBOLITE is available now with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>The &#39;Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle&#39; on itch.io has lots of games, TTRPGs and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The itch.io store is hosting another big charity bundle full of video games, TTRPGs, zines, books, soundtracks, and asset packs in support of eSims and Crips for eSims for Gaza.</p>
<p>Quoted from the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the current escalation of violence beginning in October 2023, disability justice collective <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/25/crips-for-esims-for-gaza/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crips for eSims for Gaza</a> has raised over $2 million CAD to directly fund the activation and top-up of 18K+ eSims for Palestinians surviving genocide and occupation under the Israeli state. This mutual-aid driven communications network has supported doctors, nurses, paramedics, journalists, family members, and students</p>
<p>Despite a fragile ceasefire in early 2025, the Israeli Occupying Forces have continued to bomb the Gaza strip and block humanitarian aid from entering. The zionist state has now abandoned all pretence of ceasefire and made it clear that they intend to completely destroy the people and infrastructure of Gaza in order to expand their settlements. Meanwhile, the erasure of the genocide from mainstream media and the dismantling of international aid under fascist governments makes fundraising an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>The Crips for eSims for Gaza Itch Bundle was organized to strengthen Crips for eSims for Gaza’s critical work and to support Palestinian people fighting for their lives, for visibility, and for liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">For a minimum of $16 you can get the entire bundle that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>74 video games.</li>
<li>86 physical games.</li>
<li>14 game assets.</li>
<li>3 soundtracks.</li>
<li>5 tools.</li>
<li>17 comics.</li>
<li>26 books.</li>
<li>Plus 12 miscellaneous items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like it has some nice video games in it like Baba is You, Bleed 2, Arctico and SkateBIRD.</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum gets a big free content update with a new large UI scaling setting for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Studios / SEGA have updated the popular and well-received Two Point Museum with a fresh free content upgrade. Plus, it should feel better on Steam Deck now too.</p>
<p>Update 2.0 is quite a big one that amongst a bunch of extra free content includes a new " Very large UI scaling" they say will be "handy for Steam Deck". Nice to see a focus on UI sizing from more developers, as some game interfaces even on big desktop monitors are simply too small.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main highlights of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>23 floors &amp; wallpapers</li>
<li>2 Staff Room items &amp; 14 Staff Traits</li>
<li>Sandbox customisation options</li>
<li>A new 360° camera and the outdoor camera can now be placed inside</li>
<li>Requested quality of life changes to staff- traits in training, and more!</li>
<li>New extra large UI (handy for Steam Deck)</li>
<li>Requested Expedition Discovery changes</li>
<li>Community-inspired security changes</li>
<li>…and much more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The game has a Very Positive rating on Steam and it has Native Linux support. Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable but not Verified due to some in-game text being too small. So perhaps this new update will get it bumped up to Verified.</p>

      <title>EA rebrand and refresh their anti-cheat into EA Javelin Anticheat, still blocks Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA (Electronic Arts) have <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that EA anticheat is going through a rebrand and refresh, and will now be called EA Javelin Anticheat. <em>Note: you can check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>There's <em>no</em> good news for Linux platforms like Steam Deck with SteamOS here, since they're still intentionally blocking Linux platforms with any game that will have EA Javelin Anticheat.</p>
<p>Currently the anti-cheat is in use across series including EA SPORTS FC, EA SPORTS Madden NFL, Battlefield, F1, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies. While they also publish Apex Legends, that's still currently using Easy Anti-Cheat, but that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated to block Linux platforms too</a>.</p>
<p>EA say their anti-cheat "has prevented cheating attempts while maintaining an accuracy rate of over 99%". In a recent <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/security/news/anticheat-progress-report" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">progress report</a> they noted some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>EA Javelin Anticheat has blocked over 33 million cheat attempts across 2.2 billion PC gaming sessions since launch.</li>
<li>Now active in 14 EA titles, including Battlefield, Madden, and EA SPORTS FC franchises.</li>
<li>Built by experts in security, data, and game development to detect and stop cheating in all its forms.</li>
<li>Fair play is up—cheater presence in Battlefield 2042 matches was cut in half after recent updates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can expect all new EA published multiplayer titles to use EA Javelin Anticheat and continue to be blocked on Linux / Steam Deck. At least until the market expands enough that EA can no longer just ignore it, but for that we need Valve to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release SteamOS for more devices as they said they will</a>, and for more hardware to begin shipping with SteamOS.</p>

      <title>EA cancels multiple projects from Apex and Titanfall developer Respawn with more layoffs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More game industry news for you today. Respawn, developer of Titanfall and Apex Legends, have announced that two early-stage games have been cancelled and 100s of staff have been reportedly laid off.</p>
<p>The statement from Respawn was <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> on X/Twitter:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19040412371746004536gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19040412371746004536gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> seemed to get a tip-off on this early, as they had a news article go up about the same time as the announcement from Respawn where they reported "roughly 100 individuals are affected by the changes, including a mix of developers, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals on the Jedi team and on the incubation projects".</p>
<p>An additional report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> noted that one of the cancelled games was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe, with the total staff numbers affected around 300-400 in total across Respawn and their owner Electronic Arts.</p>

      <title>8BitDo Ultimate 2 is getting full Steam Input support for more buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of my gripes with my original 8BitDo Ultimate 2.4G Controller is that Steam Input cannot see the additional buttons on the back, but it seems that with the latest firmware updates to the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 that 8BitDo are solving the situation.</p>
<p>The problem with the original is that they're not full hardware buttons, so they cannot be mapped normally and <em>need</em> the software from 8BitDo. So that's something that seemingly cannot be solved but for their newer hardware that doesn't seem to be a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14052003151746003555gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As noted on the Steam forum in a post talking about the 8Bitdo Ultimate 2, a user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/591764731433410123/#c591769544351034155" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> improvements in a later firmware update for it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bumping this again. With a recent beta firmware for the Ultimate 2 all of its back buttons, rumble and Gyro is now detected in steam. The only thing stopping it from working fully is the steam input UI being updated to support it. You can technically mess with a layout on a different controller (like the steam deck controller) and export that as a template to configure gyro settings but that's less than ideal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Valve developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/591764731433410123/#c591769544351038572" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the UI support is planned but not ready to ship yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice! Hopefully we'll see this expanded Steam Input support for more 8Bitdo hardware and other controllers in future.</p>
<p><em>When this lands, I might actually have to upgrade to the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.</em></p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble from SEGA gets indefinitely delayed to add more features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Rumble from SEGA seems to be their answer to a Fall Guys-like multiplayer party game, it looks like it could be good fun but the global release has now been indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>While there's no new date being given, they sound quite positive on it. Seems like they just want more time to expand the content, after getting good feedback from their previews.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2951690/view/539978609968807946" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> of Steam they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to your incredible support, we’ve surpassed 1.4 million pre-registrations, a milestone that speaks volumes about your passion for Sonic Rumble. With this level of excitement, we feel an even greater responsibility to deliver an experience worthy of your time.<br/>
<br/>
We’re also very proud of the amazing positive response Sonic Rumble has already received, with App Store ratings averaging 4.8.<br/>
<br/>
As we prepare for Update 1.2, we’ll be introducing several exciting new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rumble Ranking</strong> – Compete within your league and earn rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Crews</strong> – Team up with fellow Rumblers and take on the score missions together.</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong> – Equip characters with unique abilities, adding a new layer of gameplay depth.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
We’ll be sharing more details about these new features in the coming days, so even if you can’t participate yet, you’ll be able to stay in the loop and share your thoughts with us.<br/>
<br/>
These upcoming changes will fundamentally reshape the game, and one thing has become clear: We want to create a game that evolves and stays fun for months and years to come. To build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting Sonic game our players deserve, we need more time.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, we’ve decided to postpone the Global Launch. We know this news may be disappointing, and it wasn’t a decision we made lightly. We at SEGA share that disappointment, especially because we’re making this call so close to the launch timing we had originally hoped for. However, we believe taking this extra time is the right choice for the future of Sonic Rumble.<br/>
<br/>
We don’t have a new release date to share yet, but as soon as we get closer, we’ll update you through our social media and community channels.<br/>
<br/>
When we say your support means the world to us, we truly mean it. A strong community sticks together, and we’d love for you to join us for a special <strong>Q&amp;A session on Discord</strong>, scheduled for May 2 at 1:00 PM UTC / 6:00 AM PDT / 4:00 PM EEST. We’ll answer your questions about the new features, the delay, the next steps, and more!<br/>
<br/>
Your love and support mean the world to us. We are truly grateful.<br/>
<br/>
- The Sonic Rumble Team</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 is out now on Steam and GOG - a great pick for puzzle game fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This really brings back some memories. World of Goo 2 from 2D BOY and Tomorrow Corporation has officially launched on GOG and Steam with Native Linux support. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I remember the early days of Linux gaming where we had a little surge in smaller indie games coming officially, with the original World of Goo all the way back in 2009, before even the first Humble Indie Bundle launched where we really started to see things change.</p>
<p>World of Goo 2 is like a familiar comfy blanket to wrap yourself up in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3eKwr2Sg-p0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48b563266668271f21df2fcb61a9a276.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3eKwr2Sg-p0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While a fair amount of it is perhaps on the easy side, the key is in the challenges of each individual level on the amount of balls you get, the amount of moves you used and the time it takes you to complete them. Getting through them all and getting a tick in the box for all three is a thorough challenge.</p>
<p>This is not exactly a new release, just new to other stores (after being Epic Exclusive and direct from their website), although I hadn't played the sequel until now and thankfully it retains all the charm and difficulty of the original. Nice to see the Native Linux support again too, and working to perfection on my Kubuntu 25.04 desktop from the Steam release.</p>
<p>If you loved the original, you'll appreciate this one for some more great puzzles and new mechanics that acts as a near-perfect follow-up. If you've not played the original, it's still an easy recommendation because it's just a wonderful physics-based puzzler to add to your collection.</p>
<p>One point that did become a slight nuisance is the line colour for when you're dragging the little goo balls, the contrast between the line and some backgrounds is not great to see exactly what it will connect with. A small accessibility issue but about my only problem with the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Steam release arrives with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Three new extremely difficult challenge levels.</li>
<li>Over 30 Extra Fabulous Achievements.</li>
<li>Acclaimed audio - with nearly 2 hours of music performed by over 50 musicians from the World of Goo community.</li>
<li>A Brand New Options Menu - Never before included in a 2DBOY or Tomorrow Corporation game!</li>
<li>Bug fixes and general improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>PASS Fortress turns TF2 into a competitive basketball-like and it&#39;s coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh hey, a new Team Fortress 2 (TF2) mod that's coming to Steam and it sounds like a lot of fun. PASS Fortress is one to watch. Technically, not a new mod actually. As the Steam page notes it was " Originally conceived by the 4v4 PASS Time community in 2018" but it's now coming as a "fully fledged and realized in a standalone mod".</p>
<p>A competitive basketball-like mod for Team Fortress 2 does sound quite amusing with 4 versus 4 matches, and only projectile weapons are allowed. Team classes are restricted too down to three Soldiers, one Medic, and one Demoman.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7tZuqCYjU3g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e714145ab2083cc741775fb66aae3d90.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7tZuqCYjU3g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its core <strong>PASS Fortress </strong>is a fast-paced mode rewarding skillful movement and innovation. Master your rocket jumps, ball mechanics, trimps, and surfs to secure stylish goals.</p>
<p>The standalone mod features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Polish to the original PASS Time gamemode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast-paced mode with endless skill expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended client customization to allow you to configure more in-game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rich selection of community created maps that have been worked on since 2018</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will support Linux at release. The system requirements note the game is being tested on Arch Linux.</p>
<p>We're going to see more like this thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve adding the TF2 source code to the Source SDK</a>.</p>

      <title>Wuthering Waves arrives on Steam, another with anti-cheat problems on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 12:00 BST</strong>: the developer recently edited the Steam page description to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're working to resolve Wuthering Waves' compatibility with STEAM DECK and will share updates in the community. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless they completely change the anti-cheat though or ACE gets a big update, it's still going to cause problems with anything that isn't specifically Steam Deck and SteamOS together. I've reached out to the developer to chat about it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Origin</em>al article below:</p>
<p>Here we go again. Wuthering Waves has now released on Steam from KURO GAMES and it appears to be having problems on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux due to the anti-cheat being used.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/delta-force-devs-say-desktop-linux-support-is-not-part-of-our-agenda-in-the-future/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a> and the recent <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/infinity-nikki-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-the-situation-is-odd-and-anti-cheat-blocks-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam release of Infinity Nikki</a>, it uses Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). ACE <em>can</em> allow the Steam Deck to work, only <em>sometimes</em> though. It's a really weird one because it seems the developers of ACE do some device whitelisting, and at times games with ACE only work on specific models of Steam Deck (either LCD or OLED) and <em>not</em> always both.</p>
<p>For this one, there's many reports filling up the Steam forum about issues with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3846267601745920521gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've tested across the Steam Deck LCD, Steam Deck OLED and Desktop Linux today and it <em>didn't</em> appear to let me actually play on any of them.</p>
<p>The first launch on my <u>Steam Deck LCD</u> gave me a black screen with audio, but pressing the B button showed an extra in-game download happening with a logo splash screen. After restarting once that was done, the game loaded to allow me to do their extra third-party account registration (annoying) and then to make a character. As soon as I tried joining though, the anti-cheat kicked me out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18040184271745921234gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18040184271745921234gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>While on <u>Desktop Linux</u>, I wasn't able to get <em>anything</em> to appear at all. The situation is exactly the same on <u>Steam Deck OLED</u> as both just go right back to the Steam Library. Re-testing then on my Steam Deck LCD, and it did still at least load to the menu. It seems they might go further than just whitelisting the Steam Deck as a device with ACE, I'm starting to think it locks out additional Linux systems once you've logged into one which may be why some people see it working on one Deck but others do not.</p>
<p>Really frustrating. Valve need to sort this situation out if they want the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">future SteamOS devices</a> to continue to be a success for more players. Online multiplayer as a whole for Linux platforms from Steam Deck to Desktop is getting messy due to so many different types of anti-cheat and their various different detection and blocking methods.</p>

      <title>Starfox-esque 3D Shooter Ex-Zodiac gets a major update with a new level</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ex-Zodiac is a 3D on-rails shooter made in the spirit of the classic Starfox, it's currently in Early Access with Linux support and a major update just released.</p>
<p>This update adds in a wild-west ground-vehicle-based stage named MIRAGE complete with arches, canyons, nuke-hauling trains, robot horses and cowboys! Sounds like quite a riot. Seems the full release may still be a while away, with developer Ben Hickling working solo on most parts of it apart from the music.</p>
<p>You can see their brief update teaser trailer on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9XSPYoD4xwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/31bf9c7ae731cbe70c522fc1fbd4e52e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9XSPYoD4xwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style.</li>
<li>11 main levels and 6 bonus levels currently (more than 12 will be available after full release).</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac.</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis.</li>
<li>Barrel rolls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Retro Disney themed shooter MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks awesome in the latest trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The inspiration is obvious to anyone who has seen classic Disney cartoons on this one and I'm all for it. MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks like a lot of fun and the latest trailer shows off more weapons. <em>I initially highlighted this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/mouse-pi-for-hire-looks-like-steamboat-willie-as-a-fps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in August 2024</a>.</em></p>
<p>I'm genuinely impressed by how stylish this one looks, and I really can't wait to play it. There's no release date just yet but they have confirmed it will get a Steam release sometime this year. It will most likely run well with Valve's Proton on Linux, and it's single-player so no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> nonsense.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4nt4dqP9wtQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52cf4d873e4516d364730187dd2f2f7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4nt4dqP9wtQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The trailer shows off experimental weapons including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CLEAN-D Automatic Turpentine Cleanser - <strong>The Turpentine Gun:</strong> A must-have for every household, the Turpentine Gun is capable of literally erasing the harshest of “stains”, with its patented mixture of toxins and corrosive design. Clean up the streets of Mouseburg with this nifty appliance!</li>
<li>COOL-D Cold Steam Applier - <strong>The Freeze Gun: </strong>Stay frosty with the Freeze Gun, an icy device that can keep your cheese fresh and freeze your foes in place (side effects may include accidental shattering). Forget the ice box and be one of the first in the world to try out its arctic breeze!</li>
<li>MIND-D Self-Aware Attitude Changer - <strong>The Conscious Gun: </strong>Our most mesmerizing product yet, the Conscious Gun is all about hypnotizing and subduing the competition. Making friends has never been so mind-blowingly easy, especially at these low-low prices!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">As for some highlights of the game overall:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Metal platformer Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior from Chaosmonger now on Kickstarter and smashed the funding goal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a world inspired by the lore and iconic concept albums of the metal music band Voivod, the latest retro-inspired game from Chaosmonger Studio is live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piovesan/voivod-the-nuclear-warrior" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>It's already managed to smash the initial €17,500 crowdfunding goal, so they're working towards special stretch goals if they get more funding to expand the game further.</p>
<p>The developers said they're working closely with the band to "supervise the entire creative process, ensuring that every aspect of the game stays true to the band's deep and intricate lore" which includes the "visual design to the soundtrack and gameplay elements, the band is deeply involved in shaping the experience to be an authentic tribute to their legacy".</p>

      <title>Multiple Star Wars classics join the GOG Preservation Program with a big sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> Preservation Program has expanded once again. After recently adding a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/breath-of-fire-iv-for-pc-returns-with-an-updated-gog-release-plus-more-games-join-the-gog-preservation-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">re-release of Breath of Fire IV for PC</a>, GOG are now keeping multiple classic Star Wars games up to date.</p>
<p>Announced ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2025_may_the_4th" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">May the 4th celebrations with a big sale</a>, it's good to see more games will continue to work on modern systems.</p>
<p>GOG said the following games "have been updated to run as smoothly as possible on modern systems and are now made to live forever":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_dark_forces" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="">STAR WARS™ Dark Forces (Classic, 1995)</a></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">STAR WARS™: TIE Fighter Special Edition</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite pleasing to see GOG put their focus back into retro games, giving their store some extra unique value once again.</p>
<p>You can play games from GOG on Linux platforms (including Steam Deck) with the help of tools like the Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris and others.</p>

      <title>Delta Force devs say Desktop Linux support is &#39;not part of our agenda in the future&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For anyone hoping to play Delta Force on Desktop Linux, the developer Team Jade has given a pretty clear no. That's despite it working on Steam Deck due to the anti-cheat they've used.</p>
<p>Much like a few other games including the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/infinity-nikki-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-the-situation-is-odd-and-anti-cheat-blocks-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam launch of Infinity Nikki</a>, it's using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), which developers can activate some sort of device whitelist to allow the Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>Writing on Reddit in reply to a user question about Linux, the Game Director Shadow Guo, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k8evyo/comment/mpc3vcd/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">answered</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We appreciate the love from Linux users, but unfortunately support for Linux Desktop is not part of our agenda in the future. Without a Windows PC, you can still enjoy Delta Force on mobile and Google Play Games on PC, thank you again for the support!</p>

      <title>Infinity Nikki on Steam works on Steam Deck but the situation is odd and anti-cheat blocks Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Infinity Nikki has now launched on Steam to suck away more of your time. It works on Steam Deck with Proton but the anti-cheat is blocking it working on Desktop Linux. The developers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/infinity-nikki-devs-are-working-on-steam-deck-support-for-the-steam-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously confirmed to GamingOnLinux</a> that it would work on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, and as I expected to be the case, we're again seeing a split platform between the Steam Deck with Valve's SteamOS Linux and normal Desktop Linux. This is due to Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) being used, which has some sort of device whitelist for the Steam Deck running SteamOS specifically. This is the same thing that happens with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/delta-force-developer-mentions-they-will-look-at-supporting-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mecha BREAK</a>. <em>You can see more Linux / Steam Deck compatibility on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. </em></p>
<p>On <u>Desktop Linux</u> you can get the launcher to appear, but the game itself will not load once you hit the Start Game button, as it just quits to your Steam Library.</p>
<p>For <u>Steam Deck LCD</u> (which I tried first), the game will load up instantly and skips the launcher and you're able to get in-game with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. So at least on the LCD you can play. Performance didn't seem very good though, below 30FPS with all minimum details set.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, the game will <strong>not</strong> launch on my <u>Steam Deck OLED</u>, it just throws up an error about the "driver could not be loaded". I've tried repeated runs, every time it works on my Steam Deck LCD but not the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4428436071745913211gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4428436071745913211gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Frustrating! Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) is a real <em>nuisance</em> with more games beginning to use it. Odd, since it works on one system for me and not the other, despite them both being a Steam Deck. Seems I'm not the only one, as a player noted on the Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3164330/discussions/0/600777026050243687/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> they're seeing a similar problem between the LCD and OLED models.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fcNGApQj3go"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0c994a7f551fe2aaf1012cc8a650625.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fcNGApQj3go" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An unfortunate situation that I really do think Valve need to solve at some point. My real hope is that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS moving from Steam Deck to more handhelds will help this situation</a>, but that may come with other problems and developers might still approve specific devices and SteamOS specifically.</p>

      <title>System76 COSMIC Alpha 7 is out with new accessibility features, global shortcuts and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 continue building up their desktop environment COSMIC, with a 7th Alpha release now available for testing built on top of Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS alpha.</p>
<p>Even though I'm firmly happy with the latest KDE Plasma, because it does everything I need, I'm still quite keen to see the finished product when it comes to COSMIC as they're doing some pretty interesting stuff with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/81687771745594081gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/81687771745594081gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13011144371745594083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13011144371745594083gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 7</em></p>
<p>In the latest release they've tweaked Workspaces so you can click and drag them around and you can pin them to ensure they stick around even when empty too. There's also various new accessibility features they've highlighted:</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening set for a public playtest May 9-12 but the anti-cheat concerns me for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is set to release on June 10th, and to ensure their servers are working well they've announced a major public playtest will go live in May.</p>
<p>The Beta Weekend is due to be live between May 9th - 12th. You can already request access right now, by going to the Steam page and hitting the Request Access button:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16934378931745590520gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This Beta has no NDA, so anyone playing it will be able to share all the details. During the event you'll be able to play through the first 20 hours of the game which gives you "most of Act 1 of the story".</p>
<p>They'll also be giving away Beta access keys during the Global Dune: Awakening LAN Party Broadcast on May 10th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="63gMIwsCJhM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa6dd4d30df9bd9ade06cf7606d9f3f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/63gMIwsCJhM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do have one <strong>major</strong> <em>concern</em> for anyone hoping to play it on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck, which is the anti-cheat situation. The store page doesn't actually list any, but it appears to be using BattlEye (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2995470/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). So unless Funcom actively choose to enable it, this will result in another game that doesn't work for us.</p>
<p>Even if the Playtest works, we've seen plenty of times before where a Playtest / Beta worked and the main release did not. So it will be good to get a firm answer on this. I've tried to speak to Funcom and their press teams, but no one has yet replied to confirm or deny if the anti-cheat will be enabled for us. <em>I've bumped up some emails about this again today, will update on any reply.</em></p>
<p>At least from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/dune-awakening-looks-like-it-may-be-playable-on-steam-deck-benchmark-tested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the benchmark on Steam Deck</a>, it looked like it might be <em>playable</em> from a performance point of view.</p>
<p>Once we do know, it will be listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Love board games and pure chaos? Fortune Avenue is a new spin on Monopoly out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, Fortune Street is the latest game from Binogure Studio (City Game Studio, Sneak In) that puts a fresh, fast and chaotic spin on the classic Monopoly. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>In the game you take turns to move across a board filled with surprises and opportunities. Each player participates in random game-changing events (there's over 30 of them) that can really mess with everyone. The added randomness really makes it feel different to classic Monopoly, like Jail being replaced with an ice floe that could transform into a luxury cruise and Free Parking instead being an airport that allows strategic movement across the board.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2bxPmjeBtgU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/051ee50a61e55592bed544d096ef020e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2bxPmjeBtgU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can play it offline against AI bots and other people and you can also play online too. You can even play the game as a team if you fancy a bit of co-op against others.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned the Early Access period will last for probably around 2 years, so they can really polish it up and add in new features, although it's already a complete experience to play through. In their current roadmap they plan to add in custom game modes, a board editor, more customization, Steam Workshop support and much more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Board Elements: From melting ice floes to bustling airports, every corner of the board holds a surprise.</li>
<li>Strategic Rule Voting: Every 12 dice rolls, players vote on new rules that can drastically alter the game's dynamics.</li>
<li>Speed Up Mechanism: A helicopter targets the poorest players, ensuring a fast-paced game that minimizes frustration.</li>
<li>Elimination Bonus: Gain a $100K bonus for each player you eliminate, adding a competitive edge.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Measures: With physics-based dice and wheel of fortune, plus advanced obfuscation and VAC, the integrity of the game is maintained.</li>
<li>Rich Multiplayer Experience: Peer-to-peer connectivity with a robust recovery mechanism ensures seamless gameplay.</li>
<li>Diverse Game Pieces and Boards: Choose from 12 unique pieces and explore 4 different themed boards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lost For Swords is a unique deck-building dungeon crawler that&#39;s different each time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of dungeon crawlers and deck-builders but Lost For Swords manages to come off a little more unique thanks to the way it shuffles everything together. I had a really great time with some early versions of this one, played it for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Each floor is made up of cards, which are shuffled together with your currently built deck of equipment cards and then placed randomly across the board for you to explore. As you move from tile to tile, you'll pick up your equipment but you only get to use each item once. So a lot of Lost For Swords is about managing the individual steps you take, a game of tactical planning on deciding your route and how to best deal with each enemy. It's really interesting to play!</p>
