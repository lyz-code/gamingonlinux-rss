      <title>CodeWeavers partners of Valve on Proton move to an Employee Ownership Trust</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After 27 years, Jeremy White is leaving CodeWeavers, the company who oversee and fund Wine development and also work on Proton with Valve for the Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>This is going to be a big change for their company, with it moving over to an Employee Ownership Trust, which sounds like a really nice move overall. This ensures the company works for the staff and the community, giving employees more of a say in how it runs and a share of profits too.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/about/news/press/20230517" target="_blank">press release</a> and a personal <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/jwhite/2023/5/19/a-new-chapter-for-codeweavers-and-myself-trust-me" target="_blank">blog post</a> from White, the new CEO will be James Ramey who has been the long time president of the company and Ulrich Czekalla, their director of development, moving over to President. However, White will remain as Chairman of the Board so not entirely gone.</p>
<p>“We believe that this trust represents a new model for corporate governance,” said White. “The trust allows the company to be run for the benefit of the staff and the broader community, rather than for shareholder profit. I believe this will create a more sustainable, ethical, and equitable business.”</p>
<p>“I'm looking forward to seeing this in practice!” said Proton lead developer Arek Hiler. “The relationship with many employers is very one-sided—employees are there to generate value for the owners and can be made redundant on shareholders' whim. With this change, I know the company has my back. Not only is it more democratic, but profits will go to the employees who generate them.”</p>
<p>Seems like their team are happy with the move, so hopefully this will help keep Wine and Proton development going strong long into the future.</p>

      <title>The Outlast Trials out now - amazing on Steam Deck (and desktop Linux)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to scare yourself silly? The Outlast Trials has hit Steam Early Access and it's Steam Deck Verified right out of the gate. This is a single-player and online co-op survival horror mixing together gory action with plenty of psychological stuff thrown in to really make you sweat.</p>
<p>"Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit."</p>
<p>With Proton 8, it works out of the box on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. When I say it <em>works</em>, I mean it, that Steam Deck Verified rating is absolutely <em>deserved</em> as it genuinely works shockingly well. So good that words won't be good enough so here's a video of some clips on Steam Deck where it has been pretty much a solid 60FPS nearly the entire time on the default settings:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zF-WOfOCKpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67e687c0aec20289c707a7f1dc92457c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zF-WOfOCKpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is how you do a new release. Make sure it performs well in general and get it Deck Verified right away. Lots of other developers could learn a thing or two from how this release has been handled. Developer Red Barrels should be proud of this one. It already has an Overwhelmingly Positive user score on Steam too, and right now there's over 25,000 people playing it, so it certainly seems like one of this years most popular games.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux the experience is very much the same, very smooth and looking exceptionally good. Doesn't appear to use Steam Cloud for syncing characters though, which is a bit annoying but not a major problem and one I'm sure they'll sort later.</p>

      <title>Last Christmas, a short and &#39;not so sweet&#39; adventure gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of point and click adventures with a twist, you may want to take a look over at Last Christmas that recently added a Native Linux version. The game released on Steam in April, with the Linux version arriving May 17th.</p>
<p>Since it appears to be on the short side, the developer hasn't really explained all that much about it. Noting that "Last Christmas is a short and not so sweet point and click adventure game. Join Frankie up in the mountains at the family cabin and help him to prepare the perfect Christmas for his girlfriend Betty, but watch out, things aren't always as they seem..." and a very brief promo trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MoPjvY_aDfY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/deb6eb03e18261839427a6a0ca6e23a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MoPjvY_aDfY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game has 4 different endings, some dark humour and 24 achievements to hunt down. With a few point and click modern touches like double click to exit scenes and a hotspot finder.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129020/Last_Christmas/" target="_blank">Last Christmas on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The next game in the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2369460/First_Christmas" target="_blank">First Christmas</a>, which also plans to have a Linux version and it launches later this year.</p>

      <title>Do some mining with machine guns in BORE BLASTERS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>8BitSkull developer of the awesome <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/void-scrappers-blends-vampire-survivors-mechanics-with-a-space-shoot-em-up/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/retro-tactical-rpg-where-time-moves-when-you-do-fates-of-ort-has-a-big-hero-mode-update/" target="_blank">Fates of Ort</a> has announced BORE BLASTERS, a game all about drilling with machine guns.</p>
<p>The developer said "Drawing inspiration from mining games like Motherload and Galactic Mining Corp, Bore Blasters takes the genre to the next level with high octane action and fast paced gameplay. Fans of digging and collecting will find plenty to love, while the addition of deadly enemies and mysterious artifacts will keep even the most seasoned miners on their toes."</p>

      <title>System76 refresh the ultra-portable Lemur Pro 14&#34; laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 just gave their ultra-portable laptop the Lemur Pro a nice upgrade, here's what's now included with it.</p>
<p>This isn't just portable in name only, as they're claiming a 14 hour battery life. Naturally that depends on what you're doing with it but the 73 Wh battery should do quite well when you need it to. It's also super thin at 0.65 inches (~16.51mm) tall. It also features a 180° hinge, if for whatever reason you need to lay it out flat.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi colony building sim Stardeus gets a big planetary expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/dwarven-colony-builder-mountaincore-is-out-now/" target="_blank">dwarves</a> aren't your thing and you want to do some building in space, Stardeus is worth a look and it just recently had a pretty huge upgrade. As a reminder: Stardeus is a deep colony sim set on a broken starship manned by drones and hibernating human survivors. As the AI, have your drones repair your ship, save your crew and travel the stars in this beautiful simulation.</p>
<p>With the latest update the developer has expanded on the planet system, allowing you to now enter any Planet in the game and they will have multiple points of interest and resources. You will also have full control over your planetary expedition to tell them where to go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14191511541684490142gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14191511541684490142gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12387637501684490174gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12387637501684490174gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Lots more new in the latest update including the ability to sell derelict ships, distress signals you can respond to, some mining automation, you now need to make Enriched Uranium for nuclear reactors giving them another step in the process and you can now build a scanner to detect alien intrusions. There's even more customization with the ability to paint everything too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19619981391684490316gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19619981391684490316gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a really fun update for a game that already sucked away plenty of my time. Full changelog can be seen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1380910/view/3722831692207775366" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can see their full overview of the updates below:</p>

<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. Definitely worth a look if you enjoy sci-fi colony builders and you're after something different, that has plenty of depth to it already.</p>

      <title>Dwarven colony builder Mountaincore is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy games like RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress and The Settlers? You'll likely quite enjoy dwarven colony builder Mountaincore as well. It's just hit Early Access and works well on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with full support.</p>
<p>Technically, this <em>isn't</em> a <em>new</em> game. It was previously called King under the Mountain until <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/publisher-of-king-under-the-mountain-backs-out-so-its-re-releasing-as-mountaincore/" target="_blank">their publisher dropped-out</a> so they had to go through a rename but it comes with a huge upgrade. Now it's properly back and they developer is continuing on with development. Always nice to see a win for a small team.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9XP3rGsGBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20264c023daebedd90b4a257920d1d53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9XP3rGsGBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned the game is based around these central pillars:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A simulated world - The game world is built on a series of interlocking systems which combine together to simulate a living, breathing world. As night changes to day, trees and plants will grow (or not) based on sunlight and rainfall. The local environment and changing seasons have effects on the native flora and fauna. Your settlers and other characters have their own personal social and physical needs that you'll have to fulfil to keep them happy (or at least stop them from breaking and going insane!)</li>
<li>Procedural generation - Every map is randomly generated from an initial seed (a large number) so that no two maps will ever be the same - unless you choose to use the same seed! The art assets for the game have been created in such a way that they can be drawn by the game engine for near limitless variation in colour - so every tree, plant and character will have their own unique combination of colours and appearance.</li>
<li>Peaceful expansion - It's an important design goal that it's possible to play the entire game without getting into armed conflict with other factions (if you choose to). Although weapons and combat can be significant parts of gameplay, we wanted to make sure you can peacefully build up a fully-functioning town to have the satisfaction of sitting back and watching your settlers go about their business productively.</li>
<li>Player-driven content - Have you ever spent hours in a creative game building something, only for it to sit hidden away on your computer? In <em>Mountaincore</em>, players can opt-in to automatically upload their settlements for other players to visit. This drives the basis of the adventure mode - you put together a party of champions from your settlement's population, and go off on an adventure to explore another player's creation. This mode will involve tactical combat as you explore and battle through another player's fortress, claiming rare resources that may be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise. It's important to note that nothing will be lost by either player in this encounter - you don't actually ?attack? the other player, only a copy of their settlement, and there are benefits to be gained by both parties. Note that the adventure mode is not implemented yet and coming later in development.</li>
<li>Mod friendly engine - Another big design goal is that everything you see or read in the game (and the variables behind them) are fully open to modification. In fact, the base game is built as an engine with one base mod applied to it (which modders can look at to see how things work). The game is fully integrated to <a href="http://mod.io" target="_blank">mod.io</a> (game page at <a href="https://mod.io/g/mountaincore" target="_blank">https://mod.io/g/mountaincore</a>) to download and update mods automatically.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a nice big upgrade over their previous release, which due to the issues with their publisher hadn't seen a public update in many months. They have a lot of plans for the future of this game, so it's another that's going to be fun to keep digging deep into at various updates. For now though, it's already full of things to do so worth checking out.</p>
<p>Native Linux support and works just fine on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://rocketjumptechnology.itch.io/mountaincore" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370310/Mountaincore/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>FX Technology tease their upgraded screen for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy upgrading the resolution of your Steam Deck screen? Well it seems FX Technology also known as F(x)tec are planning to offer Steam Deck screen upgrades under the Deck HD brand.</p>
<p>The screen on all three models of the Steam Deck have a 1280x800 resolution, and the top-end Steam Deck has special anti-glare coating. What if we could swap it out for a 1920x1200 anti-glare screen? Well that's their plan. Not just that though, their screen will offer better colours too they claim 74% AdobeRGB Coverage versus 45% AdobeRGB Coverage on the original Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992438261684430442gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992438261684430442gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not available yet but you can join the waitlist on their <a href="https://www.deckhd.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, with a price expected to be around $99.</p>
<p>An interesting idea, although it's worth remembering that powering that extra screen resolution will come with a cost attached. Even at the 800p of the existing Steam Deck screen, that can be too much for some of the latest AAA games to handle. Might be nice for some older games though, or just anything that <em>isn't</em> the latest 3D AAA titles.</p>
<p>I actually spoke about this in my recent Steam Deck news round-up video, as it was <a href="https://twitter.com/balika011/status/1657086740350263302" target="_blank">teased</a> on Twitter but only today I found the official site launch for it. Anyway my round-up is below:</p>

      <title>Kubuntu Focus launch the 5th-gen M2 Laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a high-powered laptop and love KDE Plasma? Well the team at Kubuntu Focus just announced the fifth-generation M2 Laptop. Buying from Kubuntu Focus also helps to support KDE development, as Kubuntu Focus <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2023/04/11/kubuntu-focus-becomes-kde-patron" target="_blank">became a KDE Patron</a> as of April 2023.</p>
<p>Starting at $1,895 it comes power-packed for that with an Intel i9-13900HX (24 cores), 16GB 4800MHz RAM, NVIDIA RTX 4060, 500GB NVMe and a 15.6" 2560x1440 240 Hz IPS display. Overall, that certainly sounds good and it ships with KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS on Kubuntu 22.04 LTS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18317613901684425693gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18317613901684425693gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can also upgrade it up to 64GB RAM, an NVIDIA 4070 and 2 x 2TB NVMe. Even with the entry level you could pretty easily replace a desktop with this absolute unit.</p>
<p>Plenty of ports too including HDMI 2.0b, Mini DisplayPort, 2 x USB-C 3.2 (with Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, and Power-In), 2 x USB-A 3.2, Headset Audio Jack, Mic + S/PDIF Audio Jack and 2.5 Gigabit RJ-45 Ethernet.</p>
<p>They offer free shipping inside USA / Canada but for outside you need to email them to arrange it.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect has a final free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect is officially done. The final update has rolled out with The Sunset Update, as Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven have said they're finished with it.</p>
<p>Quite a surprise to see actually. Paradox only purchased the rights to it back in 2019, and I expected it to just keep on going for a lot longer than this, more like what they've done with their other strategy games but it's still had a rather long life. Perhaps a sequel is secretly in the works?</p>
<p>Anyway this final update they said the focus was on improving the player experience as much as possible.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G0GAiCxMjmo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01908d499b0d28e66de11c294183c47f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G0GAiCxMjmo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Capacitor 2.0: I introduce to you, the Capacitor Max Plus - an upgraded version of the capacitor which allows your Power Stations to now produce twice the amount of power than they did before - for twice the price of course.</li>
<li>Remote Doors: We have added a coloured variant of the remote doors for both Death Row and Supermax security levels.</li>
<li>Riot Van Speed: Due to the efficiency of air-bound emergency units we have increased the movement speed of the Riot Guard Vans, to lower their arrival time.</li>
<li>Super Dog Mutator: Due to our undeniable fondness of them, we’ve added a new mutator based on the Super Guard mutator which will help give our furry friends an upgrade.</li>
<li>Updated Descriptions: After sweeping through the game we decided to update or add a number of new text strings. As such we’ve updated text for Item description, Staff descriptions, and also Need Descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a whole lot of bug fixes and general cleanups as well. Full details on what's changed <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-sunset-update-is-live-this-ones-for-you.1584895/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy Prison Architect from <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/prison-architect?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/prison_architect?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prison-architect?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today revealed multiple models of the GeForce RTX 4060. One model launches soon, the others months later in July. NVIDIA are positioning these cards as the "Ultimate Graphics Cards for 1080p Gaming".</p>
<p>The only model actually launching soon is the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) which hits retail on May 24th for $399 / £389. They're also launching the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (16GB) in July for $499 / £479 and then the plain GeForce RTX 4060 also in July for $299 / £289. They also plan to have a Founders Edition of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB direct from their store.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes The Elder Scrolls Online launcher &amp; improves Street Fighter 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh May upgrade for Proton Experimental has arrived giving us a few tweaks to improve some select games. Here's what's new in the May 17th upgrade.</p>
<p>Valve are listing Super Bomberman R as a newly playable title, the rest are fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed The Elder Scrolls Online displaying an empty/flickering launcher window.</li>
<li>Improved video playback in Roboquest.</li>

<p>Is there something specific you're hoping Valve can improve in Proton for Steam Deck or desktop Linux? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>How to change your Proton version:</p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Valve tries to improve Big Picture Mode on Linux for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Steam Beta Client for desktop, Valve has made an attempt to improve the experience for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux. Since the New Big Picture Mode landed, it has been pretty rough for NVIDIA users and that's being kind. It's sluggish as heck but now perhaps for some a bit better.</p>
<p>For Linux from the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3731840159844956304" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse input not working in the Store/Community pages on process startup.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse input not working in the top area of the window when dpi scaling was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed hidpi scaling not working on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed HW acceleration not being enabled on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture mode performance when using Nvidia GPUs. Known issue: some visual artifacts may appear. Use -disable-desktop-gl-fallback to restore previous behaviour if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10904948361684411788gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10904948361684411788gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For me, I saw <em>no</em> improvements at all, it's still sluggish and the first attempt to load it just completely and instantly logged me out of KDE Plasma - ouch. Let me know how you get on in the comments!</p>
<p>The other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with a black Library pane when starting Steam with -silent (used when Steam starts with your computer) and then clicking on a Steam shortcut to bring up the main window.</li>
<li>Fixed links in EULA not being clickable</li>
<li>Fixed options in context menus and dropdowns being inaccessible if they overlapped the bottom bar.</li>
<li>Fixed screenshots for mods or some non-Steam games becoming inaccessible in screenshots manager.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced rumble request frequency - the requests over bluetooth may have been causing latency in some gyro over bluetooth setups.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mundfish remove graphics options from Atomic Heart on Steam Deck (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17:09 UTC</strong>: they said in a new <a href="https://twitter.com/mundfish/status/1659237675436474379" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post, that they're now going to be adding specific settings just for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our team, striving to provide all players with the best experience, continued looking for ways to maximize #AtomicHeart performance and is glad to announce that it has been made possible to add specific graphics settings relevant for Steam Deck with the future patches. Stay tuned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we've gone from having all settings, to having none and next we're getting dedicated settings. Okay then.</p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below:</em></u></p>
<p>This is just weird. Developer Mundfish seems to have intentionally removed all graphics options for Atomic Heart on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Originally, they seemed to be claiming it as a bug and that it would be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12iaqk4/comment/jfxxi8o/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">fixed</a>. A month later though, and their team on <a href="https://twitter.com/mundfish/status/1658860230606745601" target="_blank">Twitter</a> has made it clear it was intentional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hear all your feedback.</p>
<p>Removing the graphics settings in Atomic Heart on Steam Deck was a hard decision for us to make in order to maximize performance, Steam Deck battery and gameplay stability.</p>
<p>Our main goal here is to provide best game performance on every platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respectfully, I'm going to have to firmly disagree. Removing player choice like this is <em>not</em> acceptable in my opinion. Give the game good defaults (like a "Steam Deck" preset), and then let people tweak it as they wish afterwards - that would be the proper way to do it. Also have an option to reset to the defaults as well, this is all just basic stuff for a PC platform. </p>
<p>Hiding options in the name of maximising performance? That just doesn't make <em>any</em> sense.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5262458961684409922gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5262458961684409922gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Good intentions perhaps but simply the wrong way to go about this. It ends up feeling like they're trying to cover something up. It doesn't affect desktop Linux with Proton at least (I checked) just the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It feels just as silly as Striking Distance Studios <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/the-callisto-protocol-got-a-steam-deck-upgrade/" target="_blank">hiding the benchmark mode</a> for Steam Deck in The Callisto Protocol.</p>
<p>You can see a whole bunch of gameplay on Steam Deck from release in my video below:</p>

<p>What do you think? It's weird right?</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Extermination is a little janky but so much fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little janky in places as expected from an Early Access game but Starship Troopers: Extermination is a lot of fun to play with friends and even complete strangers. <u>Note</u>: copy provided by Evolve.</p>
<p>Luckily I was able to get a good couple of games in before the release, so I could already see that it was working quite nicely on desktop Linux with Proton. I've been testing it with Proton Experimental and everything as far as I can see works great! As a big fan of the original film, the books and the old Roughnecks CGI series I've wanted a game just like this for a long time but nothing before it really came close. This is good enough that I can easily see myself spending a whole lot of time crushing bugs because as we all know — the only good bug is a dead bug.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FDdRjfwOLoM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/541ff7de46335642f2609ae19d73dfa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FDdRjfwOLoM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The statement "good enough" I think is really hitting the nail on the head here though. There's a <em>lot</em> of potential but it's early days for the game. A great start to what I honestly think will end up as a great game overall, if they manage to fix the janky feeling of some of the alien movement like how they jump to the side sometimes, which just looks a bit ridiculous and get a lot more content in there.</p>
<p>With multiple player classes, each with their own levelling and unlocks, there's space for them to make this really interesting and worth playing more but the problem is just how light it is on level content. We just seem to be repeating the same few levels over and over right now. Wouldn't be so bad if there were more dynamic events so I'm looking forward to the multiple planets they say they'll be adding in.</p>
<p>Part of the jankiness is the building system, with all of you being able to build when the time comes to prepare at the end of a mission. This generally results in a big mess. Feels like it's also part of the charm though at the same time, with a whole bunch of you building walls and towers with no real plan and then watch as it all crumbles down as the Arachnids crash through it later.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperative Gameplay </strong>- 16 players can team up in squads of four to defend their base, complete objectives, gather resources, and <em>try</em> to kill every Bug in sight. </li>
<li><strong>Three Playable Classes</strong> - Choose from Assault, Support, and Defense classes to best suit your playstyle and support the rest of your squad. </li>
<li><strong>Build Defenses</strong> - Construct walls, towers, ammo stations, and more using resources acquired from planetside refineries. </li>
<li><strong>Class Progression System </strong>- Unlock new weapons, equipment, and perks for each class to become an elite warfighter among the Deep Space Vanguard. </li>
<li><strong>5 Unique Bug Types</strong> -<strong> </strong>At Early Access launch, encounter Drone, Warrior, Gunner, Plasma Grenadier, and Tiger Elite enemy Bugs during missions. </li>
<li><strong>Escalating Infestation Levels </strong>- Increasing Bug threat levels during missions bring bigger and more dangerous enemies to the fight. </li>
<li><strong>Large-scale Battles </strong>- A massive map with five unique zones, and swarm-based combat with hundreds of enemy Bugs on screen delivers the sense of an overwhelming planetary war. </li>
<li><strong>Ground War </strong>- Retake bases and refineries, destroy hives, and complete a variety of side objectives to wrest control of the map away from the Bug menace. </li>
<li><strong>Ping system </strong>- Communication is key! The ‘Ping’ system gives players a quick and easy way to call out points of interest, objectives, incoming enemies, and more to teammates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note it does use Easy Anti-Cheat, which can often be a problem for Steam Deck and desktop Linux. In this case though it has worked fine throughout pre-release and now after release it continues working. I did ask for an official statement of support on EAC + Proton but have yet to get a reply on it from the developer but I am chasing them on it.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, you may want to sit and wait a while for some big needed optimizations, because even on the lowest details possible it often couldn't hold 30FPS or even 20FPS during the late-game hordes. Here's some gameplay from Steam Deck and desktop Linux:</p>

      <title>Realm Architect looks like an awesome modern VTT</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Realm Architect is an attempt to make a next-gen virtual tabletop experience, while also keeping it simpler to get into and keep running. It also looks great and it's confirmed to get Linux support now too.</p>
<p>They say that it "completely changes the way you create and play TTRPG campaigns, makes it easier than ever before to set up entire worlds, or Realms as they are called here, and removes the time-consuming stress of preparing everything down to the most minor of details".</p>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/realmarchitect/realm-architect/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the initial €22,000 goal smashed very quickly and it's now sitting around €86,000. Thanks to the current funding level, we now have Linux support fully confirmed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J4hOxNhuRNc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0bdd1b86ff809979f811140bc36aa9ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J4hOxNhuRNc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag &amp; Drop</strong>: The ease of use in Realm Architect is next to none, with zero coding required. Every essential element is right there for you to drag &amp; drop onto your map.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use codex</strong>: Whether you want to upload your own character sheets and monster manuals or use existing ones, it's as easy as the click of a button.</li>
<li><strong>No notes required:</strong> Our automated systems keep track of player HP, status effects, and even buffs &amp; boons that affect your die-rolls. No need to write anything down, we do all the grunt work for you!</li>
<li><strong>Build Realms, not maps</strong>: You can navigate from the world map, to a town center, and waltz into the inn with a few clicks, no need to load separate scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Plug &amp; Play</strong>: Realm Architect will have ready-made content for you to adventure through. Choose from campaigns made by experienced GMs and veteran publishers and find whatever your thrill-seeking heart may require.</li>
<li><strong>Make it your own</strong>: the UI will be customizable so the look &amp; feel of the interface matches your campaign. Going for a Lovecraftian horror setting or a cyberpunk sci-fi thriller? Everything is possible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So why yet another one? It all comes down to time and easy of use it seems. They think they can do better than the likes of Foundry VTT, Roll20 and others.</p>

<p>Here's all that's new:</p>

<li>Add drag and drop on the main window. Dropped files will be matched No-Intro, Redump and TOSEC checksums.</li>
<li>Add support for ModDB links in installers (moddb python module required).</li>
<li>Added "Missing" sidebar option for games whose directory is missing.</li>
<li>Re-style the configuration, preferences, installer and add-games windows.</li>
<li>Group configuration options into sections.</li>
<li>Added checkbox to stop asking for the launch config for a game.</li>
<li>Added checkbox to sort installed games first.</li>
<li>Support for launch-configs in shortcuts and the command line.</li>
<li>Show platform badges on banners and cover-art.</li>
<li>Installing games from setup files can now use different presets (Win98, 3DFX, ...).</li>
<li>Add filter field to runner list.</li>
<li>Show game count in search bar.</li>
<li>Workaround Humble Bundle authentication issues by allowing importing cookies from Firefox.</li>
<li>Add Itch.io integration.</li>
<li>Add Battle.net integration (protobuf dependency required).</li>
<li>Improve detection of DOSBox games on GOG.</li>
<li>Added "Unspecified" Vulkan ICD option.</li>
<li>Removed ResidualVM (now merged into ScummVM).</li>
<li>Detect obsolete Vulkan drivers and default to DXVK 1.x for them.</li>
<li>Improved High-DPI support for custom media.</li>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Have you picked up anything during Steam Sports Fest 2023?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/sports" target="_blank">Steam Sports Fest</a> has officially begun (I'm a little late on that) and it runs until May 22nd, so you've got plenty of time to check it out. During this time there are demos, discounts, free Steam stickers each day and more.</p>
<p>What actually counts as a sport when it comes to games is a pretty wide genre, that said sports as a whole is a pretty big net so no doubt there's something you'll be able to find.</p>
<p>Valve continue doing their funny little trailers now too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GXb-t1U6_kA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d7fd456f2937314b6dd917ee5746c406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GXb-t1U6_kA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Although they do the more serious business trailers as well:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ug6gAP8EdjI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8a325edca41eb1cc733b81e9031fa0f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ug6gAP8EdjI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you scroll down the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/sports" target="_blank">special sale page</a>, there will be all sorts of filters you can apply. It's pretty slim pickings if you're only going for Native Linux games though. For Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton, there's <em>loads</em> of good picks that work out of the box. Admittedly sporting games aren't exactly my jam though.</p>
<p>Have you picked up anything good?</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 525.47.24 brings new extensions, 4GB+ pipeline caches support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have a brand new release of their special developer-focused <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> with v525.47.24 available now. This driver series is mainly aimed at game developers, open source developers, and anyone who needs the latest Vulkan extension support.</p>
<p>Here's the newer extensions added:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_dynamic_state.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_dynamic_state</a> - This extension adds support for setting attachment feedback loops dynamically on command buffers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_memory_priority.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_memory_priority</a> [Linux] - This extension adds a priority value specified at memory allocation time. On some systems with both device-local and non-device-local memory heaps, the implementation may transparently move memory from one heap to another when a heap becomes full (for example, when the total memory used across all processes exceeds the size of the heap). In such a case, this priority value may be used to determine which allocations are more likely to remain in device-local memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory</a> [Linux] - Vulkan is frequently implemented on multi-user and multi-process operating systems where the device-local memory can be shared by more than one process. On such systems the size of the device-local memory available to the application may not be the full size of the memory heap at all times. In order for these operating systems to support multiple applications the device-local memory is virtualized and paging is used to move memory between device-local and host-local memory heaps, transparent to the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what else has changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li>Support for 4GB+ pipeline caches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Correctly handle VkAccelerationStructureTrianglesOpacityMicromapEXT.micromap and VkAccelerationStructureTrianglesDisplacementMicromapNV.micromap NULL handles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For normal gamers and desktop users, you generally want to stick with their main driver series. Recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/nvidia-release-details-of-security-issues-and-release-new-drivers/" target="_blank">NVIDIA released</a> details of security issues and release new drivers so be sure to check you're up to date.</p>

      <title>Immersion Corporation sues Valve over Steam Deck and Valve Index haptics tech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Immersion Corporation have a history of taking on companies and winning, with Valve being the latest in the firing line over Immersion's patents. The patents involved are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7336260B2/en" target="_blank">7,336,260</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8749507B2/en" target="_blank">8,749,507</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9430042B2/en" target="_blank">9,430,042</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9116546B2/en" target="_blank">9,116,546</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10627907B2/en" target="_blank">10,627,907</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10665067B2/en" target="_blank">10,665,067</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11175738B2/en" target="_blank">11,175,738</a>.</p>
<p>They're pretty notorious for this going after Xiaomi, Meta (Facebook), Sony, Microsoft and more in the past. Most companies just seem to partner up with them now and license their stuff. </p>
<p>From the press <a href="https://ir.immersion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/immersion-files-complaint-against-valve-us-district-court" target="_blank">release</a>:</p>
<p>“Immersion and its employees have worked diligently for almost 30 years to invent innovative haptic technologies that allow people to use their sense of touch to engage with products and experience the digital world around them. Our intellectual property is relevant to many of the most important and cutting-edge ways in which haptic technology is and can be deployed, and, in the case of AR/VR experiences, haptics is crucial to an immersive user experience,” said Eric Singer, Chairman and CEO.</p>
<p>“While we are pleased to see that Valve recognizes the value of haptics and has adopted our haptic technology in its handheld video game and AR/VR systems as part of its effort to generate revenue streams through the sales of hardware, games and other virtual assets, and advertisements, it is important for us to protect our business against infringement of our intellectual property to preserve the investments that we have made in our technology,” added Mr. Singer. “We must ensure that our intellectual property is recognized as a necessary feature in the handheld video game and emerging AR/VR markets, even when litigation becomes necessary.”</p>
<p>I have reached out to Valve Press, to see if they have any statement to share on this.</p>

      <title>Valheim has a performance boost patch in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim is a fantastic game but it could do with some optimisations, especially when you're building up a big castle and whatever else people come up with. Thankfully Iron Gate have put out some improvements.</p>
<p>Available now in their public Beta on Steam a patch has arrived for testing that optimises many parts of the game for worlds big and small, which should also result in better network performance, better loading times and smaller save file sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13379357531684259863gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13379357531684259863gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, as an important note, they say to backup your save files, as it's less backwards compatible than before. So if you're testing, be sure to make an extra backup first.</p>
<p>Highlights of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/5448836977170331099" target="_blank">Patch 0.216.5</a> (Public Test):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many performance, memory and networking improvements for both small and large worlds</li>
<li>World save file size greatly reduced</li>
<li>Fixed hitbox issue for close combat and spear throwing issue</li>
<li>Minimap pin input fixed on steam deck &amp; big picture mode</li>
<li>Added "UI scaling" to settings on Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed endless loading of save manager when switching tabs too fast</li>
<li>World save files that are corrupt, have load errors or have missing meta files can now be restored from the most recent backup directly from within the Select World menu by pressing the "Start" button.</li>
<li>Save file stability &amp; issues fixed</li>
<li>Decreased load times in the Manage Saves menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the GUI to not update when deleting the bottommost backup in the Manage Saves menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see such upgrades being made, in addition to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valheim-is-getting-siege-weapons-fortresses-and-fearsome-foes/" target="_blank">new content teasers</a> we've been getting.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam gets game trials with Dead Space being first, plus Valve dumps Google Analytics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of Steam news for you here, as Valve continue iterating on Steam features for players and developers.</p>
<p>The first of which, is that it seems Steam now supports game trials with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> giving you the ability to play 90 minutes free until May 29th. As far as I know, this is officially the first proper time Valve has enabled a developer to do this. With it being announced in a Steam post, the game is also 20% off.</p>
<p>You can play Dead Space on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton 8.0. Although if you're on desktop Linux, you might want Proton Experimental <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/proton-experimental-improves-ea-app-battlenet-and-nvapi-enabled-for-many-games/" target="_blank">which recently enabled the NVAPI</a> for it (for NVIDIA GPUs).</p>
<p>What do you think to trials of games on Steam?</p>
<p>Another bit of news is more for developers, but it's actually a good thing for Steam customers as well. Valve announced in a Steamworks <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3719453992486109639" target="_blank">blog post</a> some upgrades to player tracking systems for developers. With it, Valve mentions their focus on user privacy. An interesting point here is that Valve are dropping support for Google Analytics as "Google’s tracking solutions don't align well with our approach to customer privacy" and so they're building the more useful parts directly into Steam. Nice.</p>

      <title>European Commission approves Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/uk-cma-blocks-the-microsoft-takeover-of-activision/" target="_blank">opposition from the UK CMA</a>, and the ongoing legal battle in the USA, the acquisition of Activision Blizzard takes a step forward as the European Commission has approved it now.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2705" target="_blank">press release</a> the EU Commission made it clear that initially, they did feel the deal could "harm competition" in the console and PC gaming space (including cloud gaming). However, after their "in-depth market investigation" they changed their mind and said Microsoft "would not be able to harm rival consoles and rival multi-game subscription services" but that Microsoft could still "harm competition in the distribution of games via cloud game streaming services and that its position in the market for PC operating systems would be strengthened".</p>
<p>So why are they approving it? Microsoft offered up these terms for cloud gaming for 10 years:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>free license to consumers in the EEA</strong> that would allow them to stream, via <strong>any cloud game streaming services</strong> of their choice, <strong>all</strong> <strong>current and future Activision Blizzard PC and console games</strong> for which they have a license.</li>
<li>A corresponding <strong>free license to cloud game streaming service providers</strong> to allow EEA-based gamers to stream any Activision Blizzard's PC and console games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once those were set the EU decided the commitments "fully address the competition concerns identified by the Commission and represent a significant improvement for cloud game streaming compared to the current situation".</p>
<p>The UK CMA are standing firm though, releasing a statement on Twitter in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1658131200181952516" target="_blank">small thread</a>. To save you clicking around their statement says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UK, US and European competition authorities are unanimous that this merger would harm competition in cloud gaming.</p>
<p>The CMA concluded that cloud gaming needs to continue as a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice in this rapidly evolving sector.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>They would replace a free, open and competitive market with one subject to ongoing regulation of the games Microsoft sells, the platforms to which it sells them, and the conditions of sale.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons the CMA’s independent panel group rejected Microsoft’s proposals and prevented this deal.</p>
<p>While we recognise and respect that the European Commission is entitled to take a different view, the CMA stands by its decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're still multiple months away from seeing what happens overall though, since the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter" target="_blank">US FTC case</a> is still pending.</p>

      <title>Roblox still plan to make it work with Wine on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The situation is currently a bit messy, with conflicting statements but it appears that Roblox should work again on Linux / Steam Deck with Wine eventually.</p>
<p>As a little refresher: Roblox acquired Byfron, makers of anti-cheat software. They've now fully integrated it into Roblox with what they now call Hyperion in their new 64 bit client. They made a choice to block Roblox in Wine with this update, giving an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/roblox-intentionally-blocking-linux-with-wine-in-their-new-update/" target="_blank">assortment of reasons</a> but saying Wine was still a priority and then later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/goodbye-to-roblox-on-linux-with-their-new-anti-cheat-and-wine-blocking/" target="_blank">seemingly backtracking</a> on that a bit.</p>
<p>Hope is not lost though Roblox fans, as they've now put out a fresh comment on the subject to make it clear that while they won't support it officially, they aim to get it working again.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/proper-support-for-the-linux-platform/56544/120" target="_blank">latest word</a> on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clarify one detail: while we have no plans to release a Linux client, we are aiming to support Wine again. It seems possible, and we see a lot of value in it as a way of letting people run on Linux without the large investment on our end of releasing a native client. For all the reasons described above, Wine won’t ever be something that we guarantee will work, but also for all the reasons described above, we’d really like to make it work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now though, it's all just words of course. We'll have to wait and see if it happens.</p>

      <title>Albion Online &#39;Knightfall&#39; is here with new content and improved controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Offering up plenty of new content for players to explore, the Knightfall update for Albion Online is here and it may be time to give it another look.</p>
<p>The open world has been expanded and improved upon once again, giving you more reasons to actually explore. In the the Mists for example, there's new Coffers to find that reveal themselves to nearby players that will give you some treasure. Normal mob camps also got a bit more interesting, as they didn't previously offer all that much. Now they offer up a lootable Cache when a camp is cleared and you can even get some pretty rare loot. There's also a new Knightfall Abbey dungeon in the Mists to find, with multiple floors to clear and lots of treasure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xhLxGK0MvnA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4f1341b0f3f48f71eec1f5b72709648f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xhLxGK0MvnA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the other bits included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extensive combat balance changes.</li>
<li>Optional WASD movement system.</li>
<li>Characters' gender can be changed for Gold.</li>
<li>New "Travel Mode" offers transparent map overlay while traveling.</li>
<li>Items can now be repaired directly via the Marketplace UI.</li>
<li>New guild logos, Season Winner statues, and skill icons.</li>
<li>Major optimizations to mobile and controller gameplay.</li>
<li>…and much more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Albion Online can be picked up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://albiononline.com/home" target="_blank">direct</a> from the developer and it's free to play. It has Native Linux support and it is tagged as Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>Going by what they said in <a href="https://albiononline.com/news/albion-player-record" target="_blank">early April</a> after launching a new Eastern server, they're still breaking their own records for players with over 300,000 active users. Just going by Steam alone, there they regularly have over 20,000 people playing at the same time every day so it's quite popular!</p>

      <title>Roots of Pacha removed from Steam after fight with publisher Crytivo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems the indie team at Soda Den are having some issues with their publisher Crytivo, and their fight has caused Roots of Pacha to be removed from Steam for now.</p>
<p>What is the game? "Be a part of a thriving Stone Age community. Join friends in this farming and life simulation game set in the early days of civilization. Discover “Ideas,” domesticate crops, befriend animals, and contribute to the growth of your village." — it's basically a Stone Age version of Stardew Valley and it was reviewing very well too.</p>
<p>Now though, they're going to be losing out on likely a fair few purchases, since the Steam page has been hidden due to the dispute between Soda Den and Crytivo.</p>
<p>Writing in a statement on <a href="https://twitter.com/rootsofpacha/status/1657485686466039809" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and also on their Steam Forum they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you may have noticed, the Roots of Pacha Steam page is temporarily offline.</p>
<p>We are sad to report that we have been engaged in a dispute with Crytivo over the rights to Roots of Pacha. We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally. Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorized them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam without our knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>While we work out our issues with Crytivo, we’ll continue developing Roots of Pacha with the same energy we’ve always put into it. We couldn’t be any more thankful for the overall reception of the game. We’re currently working on a roadmap and are excited to say it’ll be ready for you next month!</p>
<p>We’re cautiously optimistic that Roots of Pacha will return to Steam very soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, this could look like a publisher acting poorly but things are never quite that simple. Especially since we don't know what's been said behind the scenes, and what their publishing contract actually contained. This led to Crytivo putting out their own <a href="https://twitter.com/Crytivo/status/1657531829673508865" target="_blank">statement</a> where they explained that two days after release, Soda Den contacted them to "unilaterally rescind the contract we had worked under for three years, treating it as void".</p>
<p><em>Sounds real messy.</em></p>
<p>This seems like a good time to also mention Soda Den won't be doing Native Linux support, which was part of their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodaden/roots-of-pacha/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign. Speaking to them on <a href="https://twitter.com/rootsofpacha/status/1654232186126733312" target="_blank">Twitter</a> previously, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a small indie team we've opted to do PC and Mac for now, and we've verified that the game runs well on Steam Deck using Proton, so we're hoping the Linux community can enjoy the game that way for the time being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 15/05/23 - 19:23 UTC</strong>: after publishing this article, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1245560/discussions/0/5617721963192270287/" target="_blank">announced</a> a Native Linux build is in testing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6179034801684147364gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6179034801684147364gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Checking it out on desktop Linux, it works out of the box with Proton 8. I was due to review it for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, since Crytivo approved a Steam key, but it seems like it's going to be best to wait a bit on that.</p>
<p>Even though it's removed on Steam, you can still buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roots-of-pacha?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>.</p>

      <title>Time running out to swap your Minecraft account over to Microsoft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang recently sent out a rather important reminder, as the time is running out to swap your Mojang account for Minecraft over to Microsoft.</p>
<p>If you don't swap over, you'll lose access to play Minecraft: Java Edition after September 19th 2023. Since I know there's plenty of Minecraft fans reading, figured it might be a good time to prod you towards the switch over to ensure you don't lose access to your game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950876131684144832gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950876131684144832gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Minecraft with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/iris-and-sodium-for-minecraft-move-to-modrinth-away-from-curseforge/" target="_blank">Iris and Sodium</a>.</em></p>
<p>So you'll need to switch over <u>before</u> September 19th. Otherwise, you really will lose access so don't delay.</p>
<p>You can find out how to do the move <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/mojang-account-move" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

      <title>COSMIC desktop from System76 coming along nicely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 are busy hacking away on their new upcoming COSMIC desktop environment, and their latest development <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/may-flowers-spring-cosmic-showers" target="_blank">blog post</a> is looking good. They also recently released System76 Scheduler 2.0, to further optimize the performance of their Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Looks like COSMIC is already quite usable too, with their COSMIC Panels feature that acts like the panels you see in other desktop environments like GNOME and KDE Plasma. These panels have their own applets, they said to think of them like GNOME extensions but they're technically their own applications and run in their own processes. These include things like notifications, workspaces, applications, battery, wifi, bluetooth and so on with plenty more coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10777032181684142205gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10777032181684142205gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1710517311684142206gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1710517311684142206gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Rather customizable too so you can make whatever layout you wish. <em>Click the pictures to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>System76 also stated that while COSMIC is intended to be their own flagship experience and the default for a future Pop release, it's designed for everyone. So any other distro could pick it up and customize the layout and experience for their users.</p>
<p>They're also working towards HDR support, 10-bit colour support, building up their settings app which will also be modular to allow anyone to add into it and they're taking great care on accessibility too.</p>
<p>Looking forward to testing the first release when it's ready.</p>

      <title>If You Like… Diablo</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There shouldn’t be any arguments when I claim that the original Diablo was a masterpiece. Launched in the 90’s, it defined a new genre of dungeon crawling, successfully mixing traditional Rogue/Nethack elements with beautiful visuals, real-time combat, class selection, an innovative loot system, and haunting music. Let’s look at the series as a whole, and the genre it largely created.</p>
<p><em>IYL will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>There was something very special about the first Diablo. Arriving in 1997, the majority of households didn’t yet have internet connections and those that did were still on 28K or (if they were lucky!) 56K modems. ADSL was rare and fixed connections were pure fantasy. So for a game like Diablo to land with multiplayer baked in was unusual. Perhaps inspired by Doom which was 4 years old by then, Blizzard were targeting the LAN party crowd?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396166201684013389gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396166201684013389gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But I experienced it by dialling my ISP and playing with my best mate. It was fabulous. The village of Tristram felt alive as you stocked up on potions and sold your latest loot before delving into the dynamically generated dungeons and caves below the village to level up further. There was, simply, nothing else like it.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnMR6SOBa9k" target="_blank"><u>music</u></a>!</p>
<p>Before we move on, it's worth mentioning that you can still play Diablo 1 today, thanks to the DevilutionX project. Just grab the <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">original game from GOG</a>, and follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX" target="_blank">project page over on Github</a>.</p>
<p>While the original was a classic, eventually selling a very respectable 2.5 million copies, its sequel which arrived three years later was really just more of the same. Diablo II introduced five new player classes, updated visuals and enemies spread over four distinct Acts. Later expansions added two further classes, but the core gameplay remained virtually unchanged from the original. It was still a huge hit, selling 4 million copies within 18 months, and its lasting appeal saw Battle.Net still reporting 11 million players in 2010!</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012 and Diablo III would land with several controversies. By then, Activision had bought Blizzard via its parent, Vivendi, and World of Warcraft was Activision Blizzard’s new darling. The focus on its subscription-led cash cow reflected poorly on Diablo as a whole. First, several expansions to Diablo II were delayed or abandoned due to that focus, and of course it had been over a decade since Diablo II first landed. Second, Diablo III arrived with an invasive DRM stipulating that even single player games required an always-on, high-speed internet connection which resulted in players in Europe suffering crippling lag in their single-player games. South Korea had it even worse after the Fair Trade Commission raided Blizzard’s offices there, resulting in Korean players being unable to play at all, despite owning the game.</p>
<p>You’d like to think that Activision Blizzard had therefore learned its lessons when it launched the mobile-focused Diablo Immortal last year, but of course that’s not the case. By now, the firm was famous for all the wrong reasons, whether that’s an appalling culture of development crunch, or 2016’s loot-box-gambling-arena-FPS, Overwatch. So while it was disappointing to see loot boxes in Diablo Immortal, it was hardly surprising. What was surprising was the sheer unbridled greed of how it was implemented. Several streamers ended up spending tens of thousands of their own money to demonstrate the appalling scale of that greed. In one case, YouTuber jtisallbusiness spent over $100K upgrading his character, only to find that the system couldn’t accommodate his power level, and so he wasn’t able to use that character anymore - the matchmaking failed to match him appropriately!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14539309841684013390gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14539309841684013390gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14567533781684013390gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14567533781684013390gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Anyway, Diablo IV is arriving next month and Activision Blizzard have apparently already announced that there will be no loot boxes. However, with the game garnering mixed reviews during its open beta, and criticism of its WoW-inspired visuals, I wonder if it’s only a matter of time before they’re patched back in.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>A direct clone - Path of Exile [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>Enough about the fall and fall of Diablo, because it’s October 2013 and there’s a new kid in town. That kid is called Path of Exile and not only is it a game focused on massive scaling and end game content, it’s also completely free. Yes, there’s a shop, and yes, you can spend hundreds of your finest dollars, but unlike Diablo, PoE’s paid content is largely cosmetic. Largely, because some upgrades do allow you to store more loot, but the gist of it is clear - no pay-to-win mechanics here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7987062961684013532gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7987062961684013532gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Path Of Exile’s character development is boggling, but the core of your power level actually comes from your equipment. Much of PoE’s equipment features a varying level of sockets, each of a distinct colour. Gem drops of each colour bring differing effects or power scaling and can be “socketed” into your equipment to buff its skills, effects, or power level.</p>
<p>This means that even two otherwise identically levelled characters of the same class will often feature wildly differing utility and damage output, based on the capabilities they’ve chosen in their development tree, equipment, and socketed gems.</p>
<p>Another always-online game, PoE features various Hub areas which are also MMO-based. There, you can chat to others, trade with them, or even challenge them to a duel for some instant PvP action. That last is entirely optional however - I’ve never been challenged in the game, nor challenged anyone myself. PvE all the way for me! You can also party-up in these Hubs before attempting your next mission.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346684661684013533gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346684661684013533gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Path Of Exile has had a rocky life on Linux with pre-Proton wine builds being a bit hit or miss. Early Proton was sometimes shaky too. I’m happy to report that more recently, it’s absolutely flawless, as my 70 hours or so will attest.</p>
<p>My only gripe with PoE is that I’ve played Grim Dawn and as a result, the action is just a bit too zoomed in for my liking. This is a gripe also being aimed at Diablo 4 in its public alpha too - it can be sometimes frustrating to have an enemy off-screen firing at you, or worse, killing something off-screen with a long-range attack and never even seeing what it was!</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but Grim Dawn ruins quite a few other games in this genre simply through its excellence. Speaking of Grim Dawn…</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Games that do it better - Grim Dawn [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/Grim_Dawn/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/grim_dawn" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>I might have 70 hours in PoE, but I have nearly ten times that number in Grim Dawn. It’s one of my most played games, and there’s a reason for that. Several actually: lengthy, grim-fantasy story which really engages without getting in the way of the action, stunning full-3D graphics that can be rotated and zoomed to your exact specification, atmospheric music and sound design and a character system that is incredibly flexible, yet wonderfully balanced. Throw in tonnes of content, two superb DLC campaigns, an intuitive fast travel system, heaps of secrets and several end-game loot mechanics and you can see why this is often acclaimed as the king of the ARPG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13404476441684014244gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13404476441684014244gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>One thing to get out of the way right from the start - the maps in Grim Dawn and its many, many secrets are <em>not</em> dynamically generated. They benefit, therefore, from being beautiful and well designed. The drawback of course is that once you know the levels and secrets… you know them. They won’t change. There is some minor randomisation - some levels will close routes off to force you around a different way, or a dungeon is spawned in a different location - but the map itself hasn’t changed, just the obstacles on the map.</p>
<p>But you probably won’t mind until thousands of hours in - there’s just so much of it all. The content feels never ending. And then there’s two equally gigantic DLC expansions!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12504401641684014246gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12504401641684014246gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then there’s the character customisation. Each of six classes (and a further 3 in the two DLCs) has its own tree of skills and effects. Each level grants points to distribute on the tree, either to grow along the bottom, reaching new abilities, or power up existing abilities you’ve already reached and unlocked. There are also three core character attributes to level up. Then there’s the gear, and the associated “socketing” of said gear with a massive array of gems which grant new effects and capabilities.</p>
<p>And then, when you hit level 10, about 20-30 minutes into the game… multi-class options become available. Yep, choose a second class to start progressing along with your first chosen class. This gives so many opportunities for synergies, it’s mind-boggling (in a good way). Starting as a Soldier, then multi-classed to Arcanist? Well done, now you’re a Battlemage. Strength AND magic? Yes please!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479496311684014248gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479496311684014248gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>You want more customisation? Okay, how about an entire tree of constellations which you unlock by earning points for cleansing altars spread throughout the world (some of which are cleverly hidden). Unlock the whole constellation for bonus effects, or entirely new abilities. There are 82 of these, allowing for further synergies and strategy building.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12389684531684014247gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12389684531684014247gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Quality of life? Grim Dawn has it in spades. Nearly every screen can be opened independently of one another, map overlays, shift-clicking, view rotation, zooming, loot filtering, loot highlighting. Nearly every interface can be searched by keywords, or reorganised with the click of a button. The game just gets out of your way as much as possible to let you zone into the action.</p>
<p>How about crafting? Hundreds of blueprints across all power levels are available, and once learned, you just need those precious materials. Some of these materials will have you re-visiting certain areas to grind for what you need, but if crafting and grinding for materials isn’t your bag, there are plenty of alternative ways to earn powerful loot, such as the Crucible (DLC - 100 waves of monsters in an arena, with increasing rewards every 10 levels), or the Shattered Realm (DLC - a race to defeat a set number of monsters before the next realm closes, forcing you to return to base with whatever you looted on the way). These risk vs reward game modes are brilliant fun, and a welcome break from the campaign missions.</p>
<p>I’ll stop there, but given the core game is frequently under £5 and the bundle of the game plus all three DLC is frequently under £20, this game is absolute steal for the value it offers. If you like Diablo, this is what you should be playing.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Something a little different: Last Epoch [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>I’ll keep this one short, because although it is different, it’s not <em>that</em> much different. Last Epoch takes a little bit of Diablo (the core genre), a little bit of Path of Exile (gear-focused builds) and a little bit of Grim Dawn (designed levels, beautiful 3D environments) and throws in a couple of interesting mechanics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6955946811684015267gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6955946811684015267gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>First, time travel! Each map has five or six “eras” or epochs that you can travel between as the story opens up. One great example of this (minor spoiler warning) sees you turned away from the locked door of a late era temple because you don’t have an imperial insignia. But by then, you’ve unlocked that era and can rift-gate to the earlier period, find an insignia then travel forwards in time to advance into the temple. It’s nicely done, and seeing the various cities and architecture change throughout the eras is fascinating.</p>
<p>Second, while there are five classes and a set number of skills, Last Epoch’s customisation comes from what they call skill specialisation. You choose which subset of skills you will specialise in, and doing so will grant points in a skill tree unique to that skill. Like the fireball? Specialise in it and you can advance in various ways - make it penetrate, give it larger explosion, fire three or even more at once, rapid fire them, or even turn it into a short-range flamethrower. How you choose your specialisation will determine how you play the game and the flexibility is very satisfying.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8555545991684015268gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8555545991684015268gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7026654291684015269gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7026654291684015269gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Loot specialisation is interesting too, with an always-available forge option, which allows you to add a variety of special effects to your gear, even mid-combat, which I definitely don’t recommend!</p>
<p>Last Epoch recently added multiplayer to what was previously a single-player experience and there are some rough edges as a result, but if you’re looking for something a little different, it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>And the rest</strong></h3>
<p><em>Wolcen [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/424370/Wolcen_Lords_of_Mayhem/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Quite a slick looking ARPG with a nice story. Sadly, also quite a few bugs, particularly inventory slots suddenly becoming unavailable, stash not working, or gear not equipping. Some of the cut scenes are embarrassingly over-sexualised, but voice acting isn’t bad. This could have been a great ARPG, but there’s a general lack of inspiration overall - linear maps, no real quality of life in the interface, far less loot in general. One to consider when it’s on sale, perhaps. Note: was on GOG once upon a time, but <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/removal_of_wolcen_lords_of_mayhem/page1" target="_blank"><u>was removed</u></a>.</p>
<p><em>TitanQuest [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/475150/Titan_Quest_Anniversary_Edition/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/titan_quest_anniversary_edition" target="_blank"><em><u>GOG</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Can’t speak to this one, as I haven’t played it, but the Anniversary Edition gets good reviews on Steam, despite the visuals showing their age <s>(despite only being a year older than Grim Dawn!)</s>. <em>EDIT: I've had a few folk point out that the original game was actually released in 2006 - it was the Anniversary Edition that came out in 2016, so for a game well over 15 years old, it's actually looking pretty good!</em></p>
<p><em>Victor Vran [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/345180/Victor_Vran_ARPG/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/victor_vran" target="_blank"><em><u>GOG</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>A strong contender for “Something a little different”, because Victor Vran is more action than RPG. There’s no character progression as such, control is via gamepad, and customisation comes from whichever weapon you favour, and a series of “destiny cards” which grant a variety of buffs to help combat. Great graphics, satisfying (if occasionally grindy) combat and good voice acting, it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p><em>Torchlight series [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/200710/Torchlight_II/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/torchlight_ii" target="_blank"><em><u>GOG</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>It’s been a while since I played the first two, and I haven’t tried the third which gets poor reviews, nor the “Infinite” game that launched a few days ago. The first two games are definitely worth your time, however, although I did eventually become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of gear the game throws on the ground as you chew through the enemies. In fact, the devs introduced a mechanic whereby your pet will collect loot and return to town to sell it while you continue to accrue a never ending stream of gear!</p>
<p><em>Gatewalkers [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125710/Gatewalkers/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Launched at the start of the year, this showed promise, but was cut down by reviewers when it turned out there was no mouse-movement option. That option was quickly added, but the damage was done, and now it’s hard to know if this is worth a look. It’s still on my wishlist and I’ll give it a try someday, no doubt.</p>
<p><em>Albion Online [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>A diablo-like? Well, kind of. I thought I’d mention it due to the isometric view, character movement and fighting mechanics, which are indeed quite diablo-like. But as an MMO, this is much more focused on gathering, crafting and guilds, so feel free to give this a pass if that’s not your bag.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that’s it for this genre! Feel free to educate me on what I’ve missed in the comments. This is one of my favourite genres, so all suggestions are welcome!</p>

      <title>Reus 2 announced letting you shape humanity again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Abbey Games are back and they're making a sequel to Reus, their god game from 2013 where you play as giant beings in control of shaping planets in Reus 2. This time they're being published by Firesquid Games.</p>
<p>"As humanity evolves, learns, and reaches for the stars, it will be entirely up to you to help them uncover both the best and worst of their destinies. Choose to foster and shape human aspirations by helping them achieve their goals or pave a more difficult road. Don’t like what you’ve built or being threatened by an angry, nuclear-armed population? You can always start a new humanity." — Abbey Games</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control Giants:</strong> Step into the shoes of powerful giants as they shape planets. Foster or punish the development of human societies. The choice is yours.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Natural Resources:</strong> Using different combinations of flora and fauna makes for new discoveries which will change the human societies that inhabit that world.</li>
<li><strong>Observe and Define Your Own Goals: </strong>Shape the development of humanity and watch as their societies evolve from a primitive tribes into advanced civilizations. Whether they are obsessed space explorers or self-destructive warmongers, who are you to judge their choices?</li>
<li><strong>Leave a Lasting Legacy: </strong>Each playthrough leaves a lasting legacy in the stars - and inspires new paths to take.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to Linux desktop and Steam Deck support, I spoke with the developer and they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're actively seeking to support Steamdeck, since the game would be perfect for it! We're also always looking to support general Linux to the best of our abilities, but since we have no native Linux users, it's always hard to make promises there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875060/Reus_2/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets a huge performance boost</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emulation coding is tricky business done by some people that are clearly 100x smarter than I am, and now the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu devs are just showing off.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-apr-2023/" target="_blank">April 2023 progress report</a>, they talked about a big performance improvement landing thanks to a rewrite of most of their old buffer cache code, plus work in other areas. The result is that you could see up to 87% better performance, although they said for most people it will probably be about 50%.</p>
<p>Just look at these differences (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13408787661683900749gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13408787661683900749gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16967125741683900750gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16967125741683900750gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They said nothing special is needed to get this boost, you just need to be up to date and set GPU accuracy to "Normal".</p>
<p>Plenty more was mentioned like asynchronous presentation with Vulkan, which is behind a tickbox, because in some cases it might make frametimes less consistent but for a lot of people it might actually make things smoother. It needs more testing for them to be sure where to enable it.</p>
<p>The Linux side of yuzu got some nice improvements too like fixing up the initialization of the Vulkan swapchain on Wayland, making it work better for NVIDIA GPU owners and also a crash with Flatpak was solved too.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 42, the Linux distro for handhelds and consoles v42 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get Linux onto your handheld PC or your living room PC console? <a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is probably what you're going to want and version 42 has just been released. Since Valve haven't yet released SteamOS 3 currently used on the Steam Deck for everyone, this is probably the next best thing.</p>
<p>It comes with Linux kernel version 6.1.27, Mesa 23.0.2 patched for Intel ANV + Gamescope compatibility and NVIDIA 530.41.03.</p>
<p>For device support, there's plenty of improvements to be found like: support for the GPD WIN 4 with controller, it adds support for the AYANEO 2's TDP controls and launching their Chimera App directly for managing lots of different things like GOG and Epic Games, support for managing the LED's on the AYANEO AIR, AIR Pro, 2, and GEEK devices <em>and</em> there's also fan control support for the AYANEO2 and AYANEO Geek.</p>
<p>They also have a new OpenGamepadUI display session option, which gives their own special custom UI (since the default is the new Steam Big Picture). This is "early Alpha" stuff but it sounds quite interesting as a multi-library launcher system with plugin support.</p>
<p>All changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed Old Big Picture Mode session and steamos-compositor-plus. It served us well. <em>Valeo.</em></li>
<li>Formatting and mounting of all secondary storage devices has been fixed. For real this time.</li>
<li>Improved the usability and aesthetics of the disk management utility in the chimera app</li>
<li>Added controller support for GPD Win4. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>The Chimera App can now be launched locally on the AYANEO 2 using the LC button. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>The Chimera App now has built-in TDP controls for AYANEO 2</li>
<li>The Chimera App can now be launched locally from the desktop</li>
<li>The Chimera App now shows app/game titles on the Flathub, GOG, and Epic Games Store pages for easy searchability</li>
<li>Fixed the ChimeraOS boot splash screen</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the bootloader generator that failed to pickup additional kernel options</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition with suspend that could cause a device to immediately re-suspend after wake. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on AYANEO 2 and AYANEO Geek devices that could cause duplicate key-presses. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with button mapping in RetroArch emulators for devices managed by HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Updated the device-quirks script for the AOKZOE A1 for systemd-boot. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Device-Specific-Configurations#aokzoe-a1" target="_blank">guide</a> on usage.</li>
<li>Added two experimental sessions for OpenGamepadUI. These sessions should be considered alpha software and are included for testing purposes only. They are not currently recommended for "daily driving".</li>
<li>Added the AYALED service for control of LED's on AYANEO AIR, AIR Pro, 2, and GEEK devices. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Device-Specific-Configurations" target="_blank">guide</a> for usage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mangohud would display in the center of the screen for left-rotated displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mangohud would not display the overlay correctly with systems with multiple CPU cores/threads.</li>
<li>Switched from sudo to polkit for brightness control.</li>
<li>Added the pikaur AUR helper for simpler troubleshooting and development usage. The filesystem must be unlocked in order to use pikaur and it is not recommended for general usage in ChimeraOS.</li>
<li>Exposed fan control support for AYANEO2 and AYANEO Geek in sysfs via the oxp-sensors-dkms driver.</li>
<li>Added <code class="inline-code">export-gpu</code> CLI utility to manage Multi-GPU systems (Useful for Nvidia systems paired with a CPU with an iGPU). See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/General-Configuration#multi-gpu-management-utility-egpu-and-igpu--dedicated-gpu-configurations" target="_blank">guide</a> for usage.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA open sources more of RTX Remix with v0.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released version 0.2 of RTX Remix today, which on top of lots of improvements also opens up their NVIDIA RTX Remix Bridge.</p>
<p>What is it? A modding platform that allows people to make "RTX remasters" of various older games enhancing them with Ray Tracing and DLSS. It does this with thanks to the DXVK translation layer, which NVIDIA now have their own fork of just for this. This is the same tech NVIDIA used for Portal with RTX.</p>
<p>As of the 0.2 release they've now also open source the Remix Runtime Bridge, from the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NVIDIA RTX Remix project allows bringing high quality pathtraced rendering, lighting, shadows etc. into classic games. This repo contains the NVIDIA RTX Remix Bridge client and server components required for enabling a 32-bit game to interact with the 64-bit Remix Runtime dll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So eventually we might see a whole bunch of mods for older DirectX 8 and 9 games, to give them fancy new rendering features. Although, NVIDIA do say on their roadmap they eventually plan to support OpenGL games as well. They should all be easy enough to get running on Linux, since Remix ends up with Vulkan thanks to their use of DXVK.</p>
<p>All the changes from the 0.2 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Remix Runtime Bridge is now open source on GitHub! You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
<li>Many Bridge improvements have gone into this release to address various game compatibility issues:
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with shader parser logic that helps with Shader Model 2+ games.</li>
<li>Fixed surface data pitch issue that was leading to crashes in some games.</li>
<li>Added support for games that change the main window handle on <code class="inline-code">Reset()</code>.</li>
<li>Allow <code class="inline-code">null</code> vertex declaration on server to fix unnecessary failures in some situations.</li>
<li>Properly initialize render state according to the official DirectX9 documentation to fix geometry corruption in some games.</li>
<li>Handle <code class="inline-code">CreateTextureXXX()</code> calls with <code class="inline-code">levels = 0</code> to fix geometry corruption in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse input processing for games where the mouse pointer would not move in the game or with the Remix menu opened, and added other DirectInput fixes for games using different exclusive modes. Also added optional input message pump hook that is needed for some games.</li>
<li>Better matching of the native D3D9 behavior when dealing with shaders and swapchain initialization.</li>
<li>Added more input validation on client and server side – the server is now properly returning failure codes to the client where failure is allowable.</li>
<li>Added DPI awareness to the bridge client so that the game window gets scaled and mouse input is handled properly on displays with higher than 100% DPI.</li>
<li>Optimized how the <code class="inline-code">SharedHeap</code> works to reduce crashes at launch and require less finetuning of its settings. Since the <code class="inline-code">SharedHeap</code> can still lead to issues in certain games we switched it to be turned off by default, but it can be enabled in <code class="inline-code">bridge.conf</code> with the <code class="inline-code">useSharedHeap</code> setting.</li>
<li>Added forced window client option <code class="inline-code">client.forceWindowed</code> to <code class="inline-code">bridge.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DXVK-Remix improvements and game compatibility fixes:
<ul>
<li>Improvements to culling issues–Remix now includes an initial set of heuristics to work around engine-side culling.</li>
<li>Improved handling of alpha-tested geometry that uses fractional ("feathered") alpha.</li>
<li>Improved detection of shadow volumes.</li>
<li>Support for capturing normals in vertex capture path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvements to RTX Remix menus and documentation: expanded and clarified the existing documentation, and added tooltips in the UI to make it more accessible.</li>
<li>Debug symbols for the release are now available in a separate <code class="inline-code">remix-0.2.0-symbols.zip</code> package to make debugging the source code from the compiled binaries easier.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mechabellum is an auto-battling Supreme Commander - I&#39;m completely hooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechabellum is a new Early Access release from Game River and Paradox Arc (the publishing arm of Paradox Interactive). It's an auto-battler like say Dota Underlords and Auto Chess, but with big mech units with battles like Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>Safe to say, it is absolutely my sort of thing. Quick games, lots of explosions and plenty of strategy. So TriplePoint PR sent over a key and I've been playing it to see if this may be the next big thing. Working out of the box on desktop Linux with Proton 8.0-2, this is absolutely going to be my next multiple-hundred hour game. I can already feel it's teeth sinking into my brain as I just want to play one more game constantly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4Rj3sgSQLdU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a852bb365d0e49a5397cb237e89e309.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4Rj3sgSQLdU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After blasting through a few of the solo tutorials to get me started, I quickly jumped into online games doing 1v1 battles and honestly, I was impressed with it very quickly. It takes the basic idea of an auto-battler, but just makes it so much more entertaining than any that came before. Who doesn't love lots of explosions, lasers and missiles firing everywhere while you sit back and watch the fireworks hoping your idea will work for this round?</p>
<p><em>I don't want to put it down. I might even have to cancel my dinner plans tonight, I need to play more.</em></p>
<p>I'm not very good at it yet mind you, I've been repeatedly stomped into the ground by everyone having much better ideas on what units to unlock and deploy each round but I'm having fun and that's the main thing. It really does look quite a bit like the classic RTS Supreme Commander, but on a much smaller scale with games that aren't hours long. Exactly what I want right now.</p>
<p>You have a really great mixture of units to deploy to from tiny nuisances, which are great to pull the attention from bigger enemies, to massive mechs and everything in between. Everything has a strength and weakness, although there are some balancing issues the developer needs to sort. Starting off by picking your commander to get your first units and bonuses, it's then a tug of war each round as you pick a new unit to unlock, deploy up to 2 additional units and then position them. Plus, you get to sprinkle in some especial abilities like a bombing run, sneaky units you can place behind enemy lines and even big storms to really screw with your opponent.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7429491881683893492gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7429491881683893492gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea is just to destroy all the enemy units, or as many as you can until the 60 second round timer ends. How many units you have left will be how much health you take away from your opponent, so you want as many as possible left. Once your opponent or you reach zero health, it's then game over. Taking down one or both of the enemy towers is a safe bet, if you can get there, as it then gives a momentary slowdown to enemy units and that can be quite devastating but they get put back each round.</p>
<p>At the start of each round you get to upgrade units to give them an overall buff, plus give them additional upgrade which affects other similar units. You also have your two towers, which also have upgrades available on each, to buff up all your units. Everything you do has a cost though, with the game having a single resource for everything so it means you really have to think between new units and what to upgrade.</p>
<p>Since it's an auto-battler, one you've finished deploying and upgrading, it's down to the AI to hopefully crush the other side and it's quite <em>epic </em>to watch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4543147071683893914gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4543147071683893914gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Rarely does a brand new release get such intense excitement from me, I only hope the community sticks around for it to give it a longer life than other auto-battlers. It has all the makings of a great game. I'm off to go play some more now.</p>
<p><em>Early Access is planned to last around 12 months.</em></p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" target="_blank">Mechabellum on Steam</a> but it will be eventually free to play.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.2 released supporting D3D11On12, plus improvements for game launchers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK translates Direct3D 9 / 10 and 11 into Vulkan for Proton and Wine, used on Linux desktop and Steam Deck for gaming. The new DXVK 2.2 release sounds like quite a big one, and just shows how awesome open source is. Once it's ready and in a new Proton release, we should see another nice little bump in game compatibility.</p>
<p>The first big one is support for D3D11On12, Microsoft's own layer "which maps graphics commands from D3D11 to D3D12". DXVK does this with the help of VKD3D-Proton (the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer) and is required for D3D12 support in recent Unity Engine titles such as Lego Builder's Journey according to the DXVK team. To test that right now you need a recent build of VKD3D-Proton.</p>
<p>Another nice addition is support for D3D9 Partial Presentation, which should improve compatibility with various game launchers, "particularly those based on Microsoft's WPF toolkit, and some visual novels". The downside is that it has a noticeable "performance hit".</p>
<p>There's also some specific game fixes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jade Empire.</li>
<li>Sid Meier's Pirates.</li>
<li>Total War: Shogun 2.</li>
<li>Battle Fantasia Revised Edition.</li>
<li>Cold Fear.</li>
<li>Dawn of Magic 2.</li>
<li>DC Universe Online.</li>
<li>Far Cry 2.</li>
<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</li>
<li>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus these other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent RE Engine games performance fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue wherein threads were not properly destroyed.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by incorrect layout tracking when enabling feedback loops for a texture.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by 0x0 sized clears in D3D9.</li>
<li>Improved usage of some VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 features to avoid hitting slow paths on some drivers.</li>
<li>Significantly reduced memory usage in situations where games create unused D3D11 devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.2" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt an upcoming Proton Experimental release will include it, as always I'll let you know when that happens.</p>

      <title>World Turtles is a city-builder on the back of a space turtle out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>City-builders come in all shapes and sizes and now you can build on the back of a massive turtle flying through space in World Turtles.</p>
<p>Now in Early Access released on May 1st, it's certainly an interesting idea, and reminds me on the basic idea found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/the-wandering-village-gets-gamepad-and-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">The Wandering Village</a> which I very much loved. While you're dealing with building up your city, you're also dealing with the fact that you're in space and your turtle friend might go into some dangerous areas. Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y8DBSWXQkYA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b646cf2ce75267163d192b539decb9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y8DBSWXQkYA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said they expect Early Access to last at least 1 year, possibly longer depending on feedback and just how much they decide to add into the game.</p>
<p>Right now it has the basic core mechanics of resources gathering, climate issues, research, health, terrain interaction and so on. Plus different characteristics of space but it all needs to be fleshed-out with more of everything and just making your decisions have more impact to the overall journey. Some of what they plan to add includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Populating more of the existing game systems and mechanics, especially the interaction of the Turtle and the Meeps with Space. A part of this lies in the already kicked-off Space Resources that are obtained through various interactions with Space.</li>
<li>Adding a Culture / Art mechanic similar to the current Research mechanic, where different building types can contribute to industry-specific progress.</li>
<li>Expanding the random map generator and map builder to include more variety and randomness that actually change the way a map plays out.</li>
<li>Expanding into higher tier buildings, moving into the services industry rather than raw resource gathering.</li>
<li>Adding more focused challenges with a variety of clearly defined goals. Also, mini-challenges with certain risks and rewards will liven up normal free-play games.</li>
<li>Eventually, making a map editor with ever-increasing functionality available to players. I already use a crude editor for development.</li>
<li>Possibly adding a Campaign - this requires game mechanics, systems and behind the scenes data structures to be largely settled.</li>
<li>I would love to eventually add some multiplayer / Co-op functionality so players could interact with each other's worlds, but that's a while away...</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mesa graphics drivers 23.1.0 out now with RADV GPL enabled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh release of Mesa is now available, the set of open source graphics drivers for Linux and Steam Deck with v23.1.0 out now.</p>
<p>This is actually quite an important one for AMD GPUs (like the Steam Deck), since it comes with enabled support for Vulkan Graphics Pipeline Libraries (GPL). With this feature, the shader stutter you would usually see before it's built up in a game should be vastly reduced and so overall we should see smoother gaming performance on Linux with AMD GPUs thanks to this.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-announce/2023-May/000720.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some highlights:<br/>
- Our OpenCL implementation Rusticl added support for AMD GPUs.<br/>
- Both ANV (Intel) and RADV (AMD) got initial support for Vulkan Video<br/>
  decoding.<br/>
- Vulkan Graphics Pipeline Libraries (GPL) are now supported in RADV.</p>
<p>New extensions &amp; features (in no particular order):<br/>
- VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles on RADV<br/>
- VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d on RADV/GFX10+<br/>
- VK_KHR_map_memory2 on ANV and RADV<br/>
- fullyCoveredFragmentShaderInputVariable on RADV/GFX9+<br/>
- VK_EXT_discard_rectangles version 2 on RADV<br/>
- VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library on RADV<br/>
- extendedDynamicState3ColorBlendEquation on RADV<br/>
- primitiveUnderestimation on RADV/GFX9+<br/>
- VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate on RADV/GFX11<br/>
- VK_EXT_mesh_shader on RADV/GFX11<br/>
- RGP support on RADV/GFX11<br/>
- GL_NV_alpha_to_coverage_dither_control on r600/evergreen+</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you'll be able to get it depends on what Linux distribution you're on. They all have different update schedules so refer back to their roadmaps. As for Steam Deck directly, this should hopefully be in the next major SteamOS update with 3.5 coming out sometime soonish on <em>Valve Time</em>.</p>

      <title>ASUS ROG Ally releases in June priced competitively to the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ASUS has today formally revealed all about their handheld gaming PC, the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-2023/" target="_blank">ROG Ally</a> and it's releasing in June with a pretty competitive price. It runs Windows 11, so for the GamingOnLinux followers, it may not exactly be what you're after. However, with handheld PC gaming rising, especially with the Linux powered Steam Deck, it's good to keep an eye on the competition right?</p>
<p>Today they revealed the pricing after many leaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen Z1 model: $599 - launching in Q3.</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme model: $699 - launching June 13th.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6690977911683815731gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6690977911683815731gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Picture source - ASUS YouTube</em></p>
<p>Goes without saying really but I will anyway: I will be sticking to the Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Just because something new comes along, doesn't mean I'm going to instantly jump towards it. Not everyone has money to burn every time something a bit more powerful comes along.</p>
<p>IGN already have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-review" target="_blank">review</a> of it up and it sounds overall like a good device, with battery life also not long when playing bigger games like the Steam Deck. They do make a point that the initial experience with Windows 11 and ASUS Armoury Crate being a nuisance.</p>
<p>It will definitely be interesting to watch how this will affect the Steam Deck though. Competition is absolutely good! It benefits everyone and it pushes all sides to do better. Plus, the more companies that show there's a demand for handheld gaming like this, the better the future will be for it, including a potential Steam Deck 2.</p>

      <title>Explosive exploration-mining game BLASTRONAUT gets a watery upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BLASTRONAUT is a bit of an indie gem, a mining exploration game about blowing up the world beneath you to collect resources. The latest update is a bit <em>wet</em>.</p>
<p>In the update named Aqueous, the developer has added in a full liquid simulation system, which they said they put a lot of effort into optimizing and ensuring it runs well on the Steam Deck too. Looks pretty great in action too, giving you a world that seems quite a lot more alive with it. Starting to feel a little more like <a href="http://Noita" target="_blank">Noita</a> now in a way, although with a very different overall theme.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/903303161683804892gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/903303161683804892gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>This update also introduces new large-scale machinery to build, allowing you to get a bit more industrial with your underground mining operations. There's a whole bunch more automation with drones included in this update too, giving you a helping hand moving resources around. Plenty more, here's the highlights of what's been added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1. Liquid simulation.</li>
<li>2. Submerged biome.</li>
<li>2. Drill machine - converts fuel to resources.</li>
<li>3. Pump machine - converts water to fuel.</li>
<li>4. Automation with 3 transport drones (storage, crafting, selling).</li>
<li>5. Mobile construction mode with 3 construction tools.</li>
<li>6. Displaying stats under storage and crafting machines.</li>
<li>7. Modules can be added to crafting machines.</li>
<li>8. More info about module benefits in the construction view.</li>
<li>9. Ability to destroy modules.</li>
<li>10. New showcase scenario for the added construction features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It was already quite fun but a bit lacking in content, however with this update there's quite a lot more to do - great to see it expand. The developer said this update is simply laying the foundation for another big upgrade to come which sounds exciting.</p>
<p><em>Full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1392650/view/3686802895182488007" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392650/BLASTRONAUT/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>We have to wait a bit longer for Hollow Knight: Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight is probably one of the most popular 2D metroidvania action-adventures available on PC and the follow-up, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is looking like it's going to take a while longer to release.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Matthew Griffin from Team Cherry mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.</p>
<p>We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. </p>
<p>Expect more details from us once we get closer to release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shame, but given how people dote on Hollow Knight, perhaps it's best they just take all the time they need and not end up as another rushed-out release like we've seen recently.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pFAknD_9U7c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e974b252dc76c3b010aef5a6a3b94bd8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pFAknD_9U7c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Play as Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, and adventure through a whole new kingdom ruled by silk and song! Captured and brought to this unfamiliar world, Hornet must battle foes and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak.<br/>
<br/>
Hollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight, the award winning action-adventure. As the lethal hunter Hornet, journey to all-new lands, discover new powers, battle vast hordes of bugs and beasts and uncover ancient secrets tied to your nature and your past."</p>
<p>If you've still somehow not played Hollow Knight you can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hollow-knight?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> (50% off until May 23rd).

      <title>Dead by Daylight gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, I've been waiting to see what the public official word would be on Dead by Daylight and now it's official. Dead by Daylight is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/dead-by-daylight-now-works-on-linux-desktop-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Recently I wrote</a> about how it had been working for a week, with no public word from the developer. But now it's Steam Deck Verified by Valve with the official DBD Twitter account has <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1656345021598121984" target="_blank">announcing</a> it too, plus they highlighted it on their Steam announcements as well. So you don't get much more official than that. For Deck Verified, Valve set it to use Proton 8.0-2 by default.</p>
<p>You can see my previous video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sEqpy3yVhsQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/32932b6ab9d9c126c92529844b98585e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sEqpy3yVhsQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Plus I did a recent <a href="https://youtube.com/live/AlEP9LwmLrA?feature=share" target="_blank">YouTube Livestream</a> showing it off as well.</p>
<p>This is excellent news, as one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam, having it all official is fantastic. And yes, it works just fine on desktop Linux as well. Even on the Steam Deck, it runs at 60FPS on Medium settings, you don't exactly need a lot of power to get good performance out of it.</p>
<p>Buy your copy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-by-daylight?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or Steam.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us closer to playable on Steam Deck, but the Deck still has RAM problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part I from Naughty Dog has another big performance patch out, and the result on Steam Deck is quite surprising. But the Steam Deck still suffers from a major problem.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, on low details with FSR2 set to Quality, you're far more likely now to be able to hit 30FPS in lots of sections of the game on Steam Deck. Plenty of dips here and there though, but it's certainly a drastic improvement over how it was at launch. The <a href="https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/15404598599444-The-Last-of-Us-Part-I-v1-0-5-0-Patch-Notes-for-PC" target="_blank">v1.0.5.0</a> patch includes many assorted optimizations, and the game even looks better now on the Low and Medium graphics presets as they've fixed up a bunch of texture and lighting problems.</p>
<p>The biggest annoyance though, is one I and others have seen a few times now, where the Steam Deck shows in the performance overlay hitting about 14GB RAM and then the game suddenly stutters and crawls down in FPS and eventually just stops. After a while, it then reboots the Steam Deck (<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6653#issuecomment-1542434631" target="_blank">bug reported</a>). A problem also seen in <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5511#issuecomment-1399504207" target="_blank">God of War</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6559" target="_blank">Sons of the Forest</a>, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Horizon Zero Dawn and no doubt plenty of other bigger games I've yet to play. An issue Valve has yet to solve or formally comment on but the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/cryoutilities-2-boosts-steam-deck-performance/" target="_blank">CryoUtilities scripts</a> can help with in some cases.</p>
<p>Check out my video for more:</p>

<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Direct3D 8 to Vulkan translator D8VK &#39;production-ready&#39; 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>D8VK translates Direct3D 8 to Vulkan, just like DXVK for Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 and VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12 used with Wine and Proton on Linux and Steam Deck. Fantastic to see the progress on this. I reported <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/d8vk-is-an-in-progress-implementation-of-direct3d-8-for-dxvk/" target="_blank">on an earlier release</a>, but now the "production-ready" 1.0 is available for you to play with.</p>
<p>In the release notes the developer mentioned "This is the first production-ready release of d8vk that has been tested against many hundreds of games with better performance and compatibility than is possible with WineD3D or d3d8to9".</p>
<p>The developer also included a bunch of benchmarks in 3DMark 2001 SE to show the differences in performance between different translations:</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons released, along with free 3.8 update adding co-op modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big one for Stellaris is here with the Stellaris: Galactic Paragons expansion launched along with the 3.8 "Gemini" patch for all players. Stellaris: Galactic Paragons expands the political system quite a bit with some new features, allowing for a fair bit more role-play with specialized abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/177172581683719608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/177172581683719608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what Stellaris: Galactic Paragons offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Council Roles: Specialized roles and benefits are included in Galactic Paragons to expand upon the new Council Mechanics in Stellaris! Find dozens of unique council roles based on your civics and government types, and unlock additional positions as your empire evolves.</li>
<li>New Dynamic Leaders: Recruit, improve, and follow the leaders of your empire through the ages! You may shape them by picking their traits, selecting their veteran class, and guide them towards their destiny, up until they retire - or perish!</li>
<li>Meet Galactic Heroes: Attract paragons of renown to your council: unique leaders with their own art, events, and stories may join your empire and bring their own benefits to your government. Or, discover four Legendary Paragons with intricate event chains and unique mechanics!</li>
<li>New Traditions, Civics, And More:
<ul>
<li>A new “Under One Rule” Origin that tells the tale of the leader who founded your empire</li>
<li>Eight new Civics focused on leadership, from immortalizing the personalities of leaders past in digital archives to heavily optimized council selection via corporate charter</li>
<li>12 new Veteran Classes</li>
<li>Hundreds of new Leader Traits</li>
<li>Two new Tradition Trees, giving players new edicts and improved leaders</li>
<li>New ships, art, and story content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n1bU_6Qy6Mo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb2b82a36b4100c3809e65222f6d3df2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n1bU_6Qy6Mo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The free 3.8 patch also brings with it the new co-op modes which sound very useful. The modes are classed as being in Beta, meaning there might still be some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative PvE allows players to join together to take on enemies as a single empire. This more relaxed gaming environment is conducive to teaching others how to play the game or dividing responsibilities of empire management.</li>
<li>Cooperative PvP allows groups of players to join opposing empires and fight against each other. This division of duties may be less overwhelming and reduce barriers to entry for non-competitive players. For those who are more competitive, empires can also be locked and require a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire patch notes can be seen on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/dev-team-3-8-gemini-galactic-paragons-is-available-now-full-patch-notes-inside.1580562/" target="_blank">Paradox Forum</a>. As usual they're quite extensive, with lots of overall improvements to many of the game's systems.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds prototypes for going on land</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is a free and open source in-development evolution sim, a bit like a more scientific version of EA's Spore and Thrive 0.6.2 expands the gameplay even more with some new prototypes.</p>
<p>It already has quite an expansive underwater cell-stage, where you build up your life-form from nothing. Now though, they're beginning the expansion into later stages of life - although it's very early. They've added in "raw prototypes" of basic land evolution, just to show more of what they plan for the game.</p>
<p>On top of that there's new 3D backgrounds for the menu, their membrane generation algorithm is now massively faster, compound cloud visuals have been improved, a new late multicellular stage underwater panoramic background, 2 new multicellular prototype organelles, separation between divided cells and colonies is now much better, various UI improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jRjg7QndzxE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21a8912bd117fa96415963bb29fe1e71.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jRjg7QndzxE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From their development <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-37-background-technology-unlocked/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, it sounds like they have even grander scale plans for the game to eventually let you go into space too. So this is going to be a full life evolution sim. Given their impressive work with the early cell stage, there's a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or download it <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/" target="_blank">direct</a> or via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.revolutionarygamesstudio.ThriveLauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

<li>Add prompt before resetting shortcut keys.</li>
<li>Add colour preset to Spiral Slide using the new colour options.</li>
<li>Add keyboard shortcut to Keyboard Shortcuts window.</li>
<li>Performance improvement for the software renderer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus a whole load of bug fixes.</p>
<p>You need the data files to actually play it.

      <title>The 2D massive space epic Starsector gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starsector is something quite special, originally called Starfarer it's been in development for quite a few years now and a big new release is now available.</p>
<p>This latest update has been in the works for years as well, with the last major release upgrade being in 2021. The developers aren't in a rush though, with the game already being crammed full of features and content and it still has some of the absolute best 2D real-time space combat around. Not just the action though, the ship artwork is something else too, with tons of awesome detail to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20454342801683638996gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20454342801683638996gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's hard to properly describe the game because it blends together elements from so many different genres. The developers say it's an "open-world single-player space-combat, roleplaying, exploration, and economic game". So it's basically a big open-world space epic.</p>
<p>Their trailer may be years old, but it still sells it well and shows off many parts of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eAvo3S0MD-o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46c7fd04994ee617319eeecbb735fd07.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eAvo3S0MD-o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what's new in Starsector 0.96a:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take on new missions exploring the story of the Luddic Church and the Sindrian Diktat.</li>
<li>Cut deals Warlord Kanta’s pirates or Luddic Path fanatics to stop their attacks… though peace may come at a high price.</li>
<li>Fly new ships, including 5 new capital-class hulls and numerous smaller vessels.</li>
<li>Acquire new weapons, including a lineup of missiles that shoot lasers (“Directed Energy Munitions”).</li>
<li>Face faction fleets with distinct identities driven by the new ships and weapons.</li>
<li>Deal with hostile activity at your colonies and master hyperspace navigation using the new “Event” system.</li>
<li>Build hullmods into ships to gain unique bonuses.</li>
<li>Additional illustrations, portraits, descriptions and encounters help bring the Sector to life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love single-player space RPGs, this is one you should take a look at. A total joy every time it gets a big update, because I just know it's going to once again suck away hours of my time.</p>
<p>You can buy it <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" target="_blank">direct from the developer</a>, it's not available on other stores.</p>

      <title>Need a new controller? The 8BitDo Ultimate C 2.4G looks great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of a new controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate C might just be what you need as 8BitDo revealed their slimmed-down version of their pricier Ultimate.</p>
<p>Very similar to the original Ultimate which is my current favourite controller, although the Ultimate C does away with the customization via their app and removes the back buttons (which you couldn't use on Linux / SteamOS anyway). You also only get the controller and the dongle, whereas the plain Ultimate gives you a charging dock too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3132264131683628623gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Honestly though, for £24.99 / $29.99, with the same build quality as the standard Ultimate — this C variant is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>Pretty wide compatibility too across Raspberry Pi OS, SteamOS (Steam Deck), Android and Windows. Fun to see their official site list things like the Steam Deck and Raspberry Pi OS directly too. Should work just like the plain Ultimate on desktop Linux too, once you set up the needed udev rules (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/zmvkdj/8bitdo_ultimate_bluetooth_controller_working_in/" target="_blank">Fedora example</a>) which worked for me.</p>
<p>Available in Green or Purple on Amazon, releasing at the end of May:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V3QPN7" target="_blank">UK Green</a> / <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Windows-PC-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V3QPN7/" target="_blank">USA Green</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V6JLNJ" target="_blank">UK Purple</a> / <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2V6JLNJ" target="_blank">USA Purple</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If wireless isn't your thing though, they're also doing a cheaper <em>wired</em> version of the same controller in the same colours:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Controller-Compatible-Windows-Raspberry/dp/B0C2TW2X65" target="_blank">UK Green</a> / (no USA green listing up yet)</li>

      <title>Swarm Grinder is a very unique horde-game now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love anything remotely similar to Vampire Survivors and other horde-style auto-shooters, you might want to take a look at Swarm Grinder. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>Available now with Native Linux support in Early Access, Swarm Grinder is an action rogue-lite game where you control a single character with auto-firing weapons. Here, you're presented with a randomised map each time, which is full of strange looking cells you need to erase that regrow to surround you. As you erase them to make a path, various types of enemies will spawn from inside the darker coloured cells for you to battle. And occasionally, you also get a big wave where a whole bunch of cells explode around you with lots of enemies coming at you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3059520341683566518gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3059520341683566518gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The problem is the clock on your fuel is always ticking. You have to keep moving, to destroy enemies who will occasionally drop fuel. If you run out of fuel, it will start quickly reducing your health. This mechanic makes quick-thinking essential and it's really challenging.</p>
<p>In the one mode currently available, your mission is to race through the cells across the map, to find 25 mining zones to clear. Once you clear a zone, a pod drops down that releases three power-ups that you get to choose one from. These are a mix of extra weapons, ability buffs or upgrades to weapons. The problem at the start, is you don't know what they are until you pick them up. On top of that, extra weapons reduce your fuel at an increased rate so it's a toss-up between more weapons and less fuel or ability buffs every time you clear a mining area. I'm not overly keen on the fuel system being tied to the weapons, as it feels just a bit <em>too</em> punishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7001182381683567230gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7001182381683567230gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The fuel system serves <em>another</em> purpose though, other than to just keep you constantly moving and battling to get more. If you overfill your tank, it gives you a nice ability buff and that can really help you out in a pinch. Especially as if you manage to get surrounded by one false move, it's pretty much game over which is another problem. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1326720861683568756gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1326720861683568756gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>During you run you might also find golden nuggets to destroy (pictured below), which will give you currency towards the permanent upgrades system. They take longer to destroy though than most creatures, and you don't get a lot of them, making it take quite long time before you really start getting some of those upgrades which end up essential for getting further into a run. However, if you collect a few and last a while, you'll also get a time bonus that gives you a few extra of these upgrade shards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11655466801683567755gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11655466801683567755gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently I <em>cannot</em> recommend playing Swarm Grinder on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, as the performance is pretty problematic. The effect of removing the mass of cells drags down the performance constantly (often below 30FPS), making it a hassle to play. The developer is aware of this, as it affects some lower-end PCs as well. On desktop Linux though, performance has been <em>great</em> on my main Fedora KDE 38 system.</p>
<p>I'm very keen to see how this game evolves, because they have an absolutely <strong>fantastic</strong> idea with a solid foundation, that really needs some balancing on the weapons, fuel and pickups. That said, even with the issues, it's already a lot of fun to play through.</p>

      <title>Goodbye to Roblox on Linux with their new anti-cheat and Wine blocking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You might have seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/roblox-intentionally-blocking-linux-with-wine-in-their-new-update/" target="_blank">recently that I covered</a> the upcoming updates for Roblox, and now it's here blocking Wine with their new anti-cheat. This means you won't be able to play it on Linux any more, at all, unless you find some sort of special workaround.</p>
<p>Previously the roll-out of this update was being tested only with some users. Now though it's here for everyone giving a 64 bit client and introducing their Hyperion anti-cheat software which they are intentionally blocking Wine with. Naturally plenty of Roblox fans on Linux are upset by this, asking their team for updates on what their plans are.</p>
<p>In a fresh statement on their official developer forum one of their staff <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/proper-support-for-the-linux-platform/56544/88" target="_blank">said this</a>, in reply to users asking about updates in regards to Linux support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi - thanks for the question. I definitely get where you’re coming from, and as you point out, you deserve a clear, good-faith answer. Unfortunately that answer is essentially “no.”</p>
<p>From a personal perspective, a lot of people at Roblox would love to support Linux (including me). Practically speaking, there’s just no way for us to justify it. If we release a client, we have to support it, which means QA, CS, documentation, etc., all of which is much more difficult on a fragmented platform. We release weekly on a half-dozen platforms. Adding in the time to test, debug, and release a Linux client would be expensive, which means time taken away from improving Roblox on our current platforms.</p>
<p>Even Wine support is difficult because of anti-cheat. As wonderful as it would be to allow Roblox under Wine, the number of users who would take advantage of that is minuscule compared with our other platforms, and it’s not worthwhile if it makes it easy for exploiters to cheat.</p>
<p>I’m sorry to be such a downer about this, but it’s the reality. We have to spend our time porting to and supporting the platforms that will grow our community.</p>
<p>Again, I’m personally sorry to have to say this. Way back in 2000 I had a few patches accepted into the kernel, and I led the port of Roblox game servers from Windows to Linux several years ago. From a technical and philosophical perspective, it would be a wonderful thing to do. But our first responsibility is to our overall community, and the opportunity cost of supporting a Linux client is far, far too high to justify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're clearly not going to be releasing a Native Linux build, which I think most people probably <em>already</em> knew, but at least previously they repeatedly said that Wine was a "priority" to support but now it doesn't sound as likely going by the above.</p>

      <title>Re:Touring is a clever, accessible and polished first-person puzzler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy first-person puzzlers like Portal and The Talos Principle then you'll likely feel right at home with Re:Touring. <em>Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>The premise here is pretty simple - you're visiting an old facility and inside are various rooms to progress through where you'll be tapping buttons and making machines work by matching up colours. So you'll be opening doors, controlling moving platforms and there's even some lasers to deal with too.</p>
<p>It doesn't do a whole lot when it comes to story-telling, mainly focusing on your progress through the 26 puzzle rooms but there is a little environmental story-telling you can pick up on. I quite liked the very relaxed casual nature to it, with you being able to just dive right into the puzzle-solving. With plenty of hints available for each puzzle if you need them too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DggKbFguLQg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27e04efe64b62a2d10d76c5a96623582.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DggKbFguLQg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Re:Touring starts off nice and simple, with you just tapping a single button on a machine to change the colour it outputs. These simplistic patterns get more complicated though, with multiple rows of buttons to define what colour will be output based on what colour the machine currently sees and more. Then you get rooms with multiple puzzles, and a few basic timers but nothing about it makes you feel rushed.</p>
<p>Don't let the early simplicity of it fool you, once you get to the double-digit levels, it will take a little bit more thought and some head-scratching but not enough to stress you out. The whole thing feels very nicely put together and well thought-out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15767075951683561886gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15767075951683561886gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Enjoyed my time with this one, there were a few times I needed to get hints but not many. The hint system was a nice touch, letting you sit down in the corner of a room and get a first basic clue and then multiple more clues after if needed to really explain things. </p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve varied puzzles by creating matching colour patterns.</li>
<li>Uncover the history of the facility by searching for clues in the game.</li>
<li>Most levels will introduce a new game mechanic.</li>
<li>Hint system will help you if you get stuck.</li>
<li>Accessibility features like closed captions, colour presets for colour blindness and simple controls.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve gave Steam store search a very useful upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a fresh upgrade to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> store search, making it a lot more useful so here's a run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p>Previously, searching for something on Steam would only take into account the name of the game. Good if you knew what you're looking for exactly but now it searches across more of Steam. The auto-suggest drop-down will now show suggested tags and categories, developers, publishers and franchises too.</p>
<p>First example is searching for SEGA, where it will give a few games and then the publisher page too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412004731683557097gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412004731683557097gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then you could also search for a particular tag like "strategy" and have games show up along with tag suggestions:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5925044001683557098gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5925044001683557098gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They're also now handling typos a bit better too, matching up names a bit closer so you don't always have to have the exact name to search for something.</p>
<p>All part of Valve's continued work to help visibility on Steam, a problem that has grown over time with more and more games releasing on Steam. It's a crowded market but now Steam has so many different ways to discover games, hopefully you will be able to find what you want.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719533364952" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Nreal Air and Steam Deck together - quite mind-blowing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I was sent over a package with the <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/air/" target="_blank">Nreal Air</a>, so I've spent a fair bit of time testing out these AR glasses with the Steam Deck to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>To say they've blown my mind would be quite the understatement. It's really a case of seeing is believing, and no amount of photos or videos can really do such a thing enough justice. But before all that, what exactly are they? Well, they're glasses that have screens built into them, to give you a truly personal full cinema experience. You can hook them up to many things like the Steam Deck, and various consoles (with an adapter).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11953315021683545207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When it comes to using them with the Steam Deck, it's quite literally plug and play. You plug a cable into the end of one of the temples that goes behind your ear, then the other end into the Steam Deck and away you go. There's simply no fussing involved. After that, put them on and you'll get a huge screen right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>Originally I didn't think I would ever get to test these. I saw a few others across Twitter had them, so I posted about it and eventually some PR / marketing team emailed me about it. Problem is this first team wanted a <em>paid</em> review, asking for my "rates". After clearly telling them I don't do that, they never replied again. A short moan on Twitter later, and a completely different team that works with Nreal reached out and straight-up offered a pair with <em>no</em> strings attached. Exactly the way I like to cover anything, and the only way I like doing it, so there’s nothing holding me back or really influencing my thoughts. </p>
<p>Basic Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>148mm x 52mm x 159mm (opened).</li>
<li>148mm x 52mm x 60mm (folded).</li>
<li>3-Position adjustment for optimal gaze angle.</li>
<li>Head width from 120-186mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm no stranger to having something strapped to my face. I have a Valve Index, and I love it. Playing Half-Life: Alyx is an experience I'll never forget and absolutely one of my favourite gaming experiences — ever. However, this is quite a different beast. You're not <em>inside</em> the games like with VR, as with AR glasses it's more about giving you a massive flat screen that follows you around as you move your head so it's always in focus and following you.</p>
<p>Nreal have managed something quite extraordinary here. Not only are they reasonably stylish with quite a low profile, as they're actually quite small, they're surprisingly light too. Someone looking at you across a table probably can't even tell there's anything special about them. Which is good, I was worried they might look a bit ridiculous on, but to my surprise they look pretty nice actually.</p>
<p>A bit heavier than any normal glasses or sunglasses though. After a few minutes of wearing them, the feeling of them sort-of fades away as you get engrossed into your game. It certainly helps that the speaker quality is actually very good and impressively clear too.</p>
<p>Fitting different face and nose shapes is simple enough. The glasses come with three sets of nose rests, each of them being able to squish down onto your nose nicely. The ear rests also have a certain amount of outwards flexibility too, so if you've got a bit of a bigger face, they should still place nicely. The ear rests can also be vertically angled across three points too, to hopefully sit properly depending on where you ears are positioned. Lots of little touches that add up.</p>
<p>Since they're AR glasses, you can see <em>through</em> them and see your surroundings. At times it can be a little disorientating perhaps, but they also give you a cover to stick on the front for when you want a truly <em>fully</em> immersive experience with no pass-through to get 100% from it. As long as you're not constantly moving your head around it's fine, and you do get used to the feeling of it quite quickly. I can't tell you the immense joy I got from laying in bed, staring up at the ceiling with the Nreal Air on playing Brotato and various other games on the Steam Deck. I probably looked pretty ridiculous, smiling and laughing away at just how completely nerdy it was but it really sold me on it.</p>
<p>Below you can see a shot (click it to enlarge) of the lense, which is very tricky to get a good capture of. On the left is with the cover on, on the right has no cover for pass-through to see your surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096939461683548745gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096939461683548745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For a clearer idea of the level of pass through to expect, the shot below is <em>without</em> the cover on with the device on max brightness with plenty of stuff in the background. This is in a very brightly lit office room too, with multiple light sources, and even there without the cover the picture quality is indeed very impressive. <em>Click below to enlarge it, warning: big file.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10338186461683549361gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10338186461683549361gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For me, being able to rest my wrists a little more while playing with the Steam Deck has been great, as using the Nreal Air meant I could sit in pretty much any position I wanted, as long as I had a good grip on the controls on the Deck nothing else mattered. It enabled <em>maximum</em> comfort.</p>
<p>Much like my time with the Valve Index, the Nreal Air has made me rethink what gaming can be, where and how you can do it. There's just something a little bit more special about having your games so up close and intense like this, it really brings a different level of immersion. I found myself getting lost with it, spending far too much time with it when I absolutely should have been productive doing other things. It's bad for your free time.</p>
<p><em>There are some issues with it though. It's not perfection but close.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, if you wear glasses, you'll need to arrange for special lenses. Nreal do provide a tiny (and flimsy) example frame, that you can take somewhere to get your actual required lenses fitted on. Then you can just insert them into the frame as they attach to the nose rest. So they have at least though of people without great vision, but it's an <em>extra</em> expense and a fair bit of hassle to arrange. There's no hardware adjustments for vision at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17408683101683545283gol1.jpg"/>Pictured left to right - carrying case, lens cover, optional glasses frame insert, Nreal Air device.</em></p>
<p>Although there's no hardware adjustments you can make to the screen, at least with the Steam Deck you can tweak the scaling of the actual display thanks to the Steam Deck's own built-in options. So, if for example you have trouble reading the edges of the screen, you could scale it just a bit smaller and it can make all the difference to comfort:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20354121621683546595gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20354121621683546595gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Part of why the Nreal Air is so light is that it draws power from what it's connected with, it has no batteries itself. So you'll need to keep an eye on battery level of the Deck directly. Charging the Steam Deck while using the Nreal Air something of an issue and it seems they don't support it directly, and there's no official extra dongle of sorts to attach to enable it. This means you have to go third-party to do it. I've asked their team to direct me towards what you can get to help with this, but they haven't actually replied to clear this up for me. I'll update this note if I do hear back on that. However, quite a few people on their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nreal/?f=flair_name%3A%22charging%20while%20using%20%22" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have come up with their own solutions. <em>But if you can't arrange anything yourself, sounds like it's time to take a break and charge your Deck.</em></p>
<p>Updating firmware also seems like it's not possible on Linux yet, which is again another question their team has yet to reply on to properly clarify. I had to resort to Windows to do this, and even there it took a few attempts before it actually succeeded.</p>
<p>How about using them with a desktop or a laptop? That's simple enough to do! Nreal have a dedicated <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/adapter/" target="_blank">adapter</a> for that. The same one you would use from them to connect up to other consoles. You plug the glasses to the adapter via the included USB-C wire, then adapter HDMI out to your PC.</p>

<p>With the above, you can then use it as a traditional PC screen too and with my testing on KDE Plasma on Fedora 38, even that worked out of the box without an issue. You can just tell your display settings how to use it, here's an example as an extended display with GamingOnLinux in Chrome moved over to it:</p>

<p>For how they actually look worn, you can check out <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/hce9oEppop0" target="_blank">my YouTube Short</a>.</p>
<p>As my first try for anything like this, I'm sold on the idea. Overall, the Nreal Air is a thoroughly impressive device that I have genuinely had a lot of fun with. It's a very unique experience that I'm glad to have had the chance to test out. Priced at $379 / £399.99, it's not cheap though, but as long as you don't mind dealing with the issue with glasses (or you don't wear glasses), I would say it's well worth it. If you can get it that is, availability is quite limited on where to buy it and what countries you can get it in right now.</p>
<p>My current favourite accessory to pair up with the Steam Deck? Absolutely.</p>
<p>You can check it out on their <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/air/" target="_blank">website</a>, and on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5LKP5Q" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

      <title>Arcane Wilds kicks off with some refreshing RTS ideas</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been someone who loved playing games like Starcraft and Age of Empires primarily in multiplayer mode with your friends, or do you still play them? Then I might have something for you that could make your competitive RTS heart beat faster and bring some fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Arcane Wilds is a fantasy RTS game with a western-style that actually does many things differently than many other RTS games that have been on the market so far. Currently, the game is still in its Beta stage but already playable. However, keep in mind that there may still be changes to the game. If you're interested in trying out Arcane Wilds yourself, you can still participate in the closed beta and get a free key for the game, just like me. Simply <a href="https://arcanewilds.com/join" target="_blank">follow this link</a>. But now let's take a look at what Arcane Wilds is and what it's all about.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="44CQZj19PQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d53b0db6114ce4b4577d9122fdcceb9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/44CQZj19PQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3>What is Arcane Wilds, and what is it about?</h3>
<p>Arcane Wilds is a fantasy RTS game in a western-style setting, where three factions compete for dominance on small islands. The game can be played alone or online with up to eight players in multiplayer mode, using either Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Although the game takes place in a fantasy world, all three factions are clearly inspired by the American 19th century.</p>
<p>There is an Army that strongly resembles an American Civil War army. This army has a powerful arsenal of weapons and well-trained units. Its low mobility is compensated for by its long range and the excellent firepower of its cannons.</p>
<p>Then there is a group of settlers, known as Colony, who most closely resemble settlers in the Wild West. These colonists are a ragtag group of gunslingers who prefer to use their explosive barrels, dynamite, and the concentrated firepower of Gatling guns to lead a well-balanced army into battle.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Tribe faction, which most closely resembles the Indigenous peoples of North America. They have fast, agile units and mobile structures, and their medicine men and shamans can also cause devastating chaos among enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11658711681683455482gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11658711681683455482gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In addition, the game features some fantasy elements, such as one of the two main resources, which I will discuss later, and several creatures that you may recognize from myths and legends.</p>
<h3>Resource management and logistics system</h3>
<p>While the three factions in Arcane Wilds differ from each other in gameplay, they are not the game's unique selling point. The innovative approach to resource management is the game's standout feature.</p>
<p>Resources can not only be collected but also stolen. This is possible because resources in Arcane Wilds are not abstract numbers on the screen, but physical goods that must be transported from point A to point B.</p>
<p>When starting on a map, players have a central port and a group of workers. The port is surrounded by a group of trees that up to 12 workers can work on to gather wood, which is actually called Supplies in Arcane Wilds.</p>
<p>We also extract Essence, which is required for certain upgrades, higher level units and technologies, and can be used in other ways.</p>
<p>Just like Supplies, Essence is a physical good in Arcane Wilds. This means that it must be extracted and transported by us, and can also be stolen from us. At the same time, we can lose these resources through clever theft by our opponent.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a resource called Corruption, which is generated passively through the extraction of Essence. Corruption is required for unit upgrades and is not a physical good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9552221321683455482gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9552221321683455482gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<h3>The skirmishes</h3>
<p>As in most other RTS games, we must use both main resources to build new buildings or train units, and then send our army to attack our opponent.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Arcane Wilds is particularly focused on fast and intense battles, in which players fight for dominance on the map or try to outsmart their opponents with clever strategies.</p>
<p>The maps are symmetrical, like in many other RTS games, offering equal chances for all players. Distributed across the maps are various locations where we can gain certain advantages or resources.</p>
<p>For example, there are small groups of natives who are initially neutral towards us and only become hostile if we attack them. Attacking these enemies is a smart move, though, as we must expand our “Fame Level” – represented by the small crown and number in the middle of the upper screen – to increase our unit limit.</p>
<p>Aside from battles, we can also increase our Fame Level by exporting Essence or building certain large buildings on the map for the first time. This feature is a fresh idea because, unlike many other strategy games, we build houses in Arcane Wilds not to increase our unit limit but as a morale boost. This boost makes our units near the houses significantly stronger, which can turn a direct attack on a base into a suicide mission.</p>
<p>Another detail of Arcane Wilds, that is very different from many other RTS games, is the unit production. Although we build certain buildings in Arcane Wilds to produce units, they are automatically “pre-produced” over time and must then be “ordered” at the port.</p>
<p>Our “order” then arrives at the port by ship after a short time. We can even give commands to the prepared units before they come ashore. If we need to speed things up, there is also a button at the port to immediately send a ship. Alternatively, we can also order this immediately via a shortcut. However, the option's use is limited, as the timer extends by up to eight minutes with each use.</p>
<p>By the way, whether with the regular ship or the express option, we can order our units from anywhere on the map and do not have to go back to the port first, which makes unit production and deployment pretty quick and hassle-free.</p>
<p>The shortcuts in Arcane Wilds are otherwise well-thought-out. For example, like in other RTS games, we can divide our units into specific groups and select them from a distance. We can then command the units to pick up a specific resource package with a right-click and then bring it directly to our port via a shortcut (here Shift-X). With a little practice, we can even do this quite comfortably in the heat of battle.</p>
<h3>The victory conditions</h3>
<p>Some of you may have already noticed: the port is the central element of our armies. Without our port, we immediately lose the game, and the same can also be true for the opponent's port as our primary target.</p>
<p>However, in addition to destroying the port, there are also a few other victory conditions that are based on the different game modes. For example, we can capture certain relics from the center of the map guarded by a powerful monster, fend off a horde of attacking enemies, or liberate specific villages from enemies to win.</p>
<h3>Other modes and features</h3>
<p>There is also a campaign mode in Arcane Wilds, which, however, is currently only playable with the Army faction. In the campaign, we have a central island from which we can start various missions, which play out as small individual battles. The special feature of the campaign is our central main island, on which we can build buildings and prepare various units and upgrades for our next mission.</p>
<p>Arcane Wilds also offers a comprehensive and well-designed tutorial in the form of an academy, which, by the way, is also one of the main points in the main menu. And in fact, this academy is needed because there are a lot of game mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>This starts with the three factions. While the Army and the Colonists play relatively traditionally, the Tribe faction can construct buildings with their Travois. So, a building practically costs as much as a Travois.</p>
<p>In addition, there are different building areas, normal and corrupt ones, which are represented by green and violet underlays beneath the blueprints when placing a building. While normal buildings can be placed anywhere, we can only build certain higher-ranking buildings on corrupt areas.</p>
<p>If the goal of a battle is to capture the relics from the center of the map, their protectors become stronger with each neutral unit camp destroyed. This means that if we destroy too many of these neutral camps, we or our opponent may have difficulty obtaining the relic in the end. However, it also means that if we destroy too few of these camps, we may lag in our Fame Level, which in turn means a smaller army.</p>
<p>This creates a very interesting balancing act, in which we always have to consider how many of the neutral inhabitants we want to destroy before we start conquering the relic.</p>
<h3>Criticism and comments</h3>
<p>In terms of gameplay, I would like a bit more variety in the strategic placement of resources in the game. So far, our port has always been surrounded by a few trees, which makes resource gathering almost too easy and overshadows the excellent logistics element of the game. This could be solved, for example, by placing the trees further away from the port, thus creating a vulnerable supply line.</p>
<p>Also, Essence could be placed only once in the middle of the map, making it much more difficult for factions to even get higher-level units.</p>
<p>By the way, I really like the cute polygon graphics of the game – at least for a strategy game. However, I would like to see proper walls for the palisades. Currently, the palisades look more like a row of posts. But that is my only criticism of the model selection, and it can be easily fixed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11681801881683455481gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11681801881683455481gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Overall, I think Arcane Wilds is already a really rounded gaming experience, especially for a Beta. With its fast gameplay and the relatively tricky peculiarities in resource management and unit production, I think Arcane Wilds can be a fascinating game for players who like fast and competitive RTS games.</p>
<p>That was my first impression of the game so far.</p>
<p>If you find Arcane Wilds interesting, you can still participate in the closed beta by following the link above and follow it on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1492050/Arcane_Wilds/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam will now scale better with KDE and GNOME</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Beta release for Steam from May 5th, Valve finally did some more work on scaling the UI of the Steam Client. Quite overdue isn't it?</p>
<p>From the release notes they mentioned Steam will now use the global scale factor as configured via KDE or GNOME settings, specifically from <code class="inline-code">org.gnome.desktop.interface/text-scaling-factor</code>. Valve has also re-introduced GDK_SCALE as a fallback, and there's also a command line switch to let you override it with <code class="inline-code">-forcedesktopscaling float</code> now available.</p>
<p>Other fixes in the Beta from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3705943193607193985" target="_blank">May 5th</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed big black rectangle sometimes showing up in small mode at start time.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fix Right Trackpad Click in the controller binding listening page being bound to Left Stick Click.</li>
<li>Improved digital navigation in GamePad Action Binding Tab when selecting LED Color Action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All these changes also apply to the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There was also an update on May 4th that I missed as well, as Valve are working to fix up all the issues that came along with the newer UI and the new Steam Overlay. For desktop here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3705943193600581522" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with navigating forward and back when the client's start page is the Library</li>
<li>Tweaked the order and presentation of some items in the account menu</li>
<li>Fixed library artwork not automatically updating in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed developer, publisher, and franchise links not working in game info panel</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on downloads page</li>
<li>Made download throttle setting field honor the bits-per-second/bytes-per-second toggle setting</li>
<li>Changed default display of download rate to bits per second.</li>
<li>LED Personalization now has has dedicated sub-page in Controller Calibration page</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the cursor position would be reset in Game Notes after auto-saving</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Friends List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Send Trade Offer opening in the system browser</li>
<li>Fixed Add to Favorites / Remove from Favorites not dismissing the context menu in some instances</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Screenshot Manager</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed screenshots failing to upload when certain privacy settings were selected</li>
<li>Fixed UI glitch when deleting a local screenshot's caption</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>In-Game Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added cloud sync status icon to Game Notes dialog. If there's a Steam Cloud conflict, clicking on that icon will display a cloud conflict resolution dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Friends List context menu items not opening links in the overlay web browser (e.g. "View Profile" or "Send Trade Offer")</li>
<li>Fixed issue where some dialogs were not appearing correctly (e.g. Invite Friend to Game, Add Friend, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the file picker dialog not showing any files when browsing for an app icon</li>
<li>Fixed the Steam Runtime info dialog not showing any information</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of that was also on Steam Deck too, although most of it is for desktop mode.</p>
<p>The new design is starting to feel quite a lot more stable now, as it was a bit rough with the recent major Beta upgrade.</p>

      <title>Cartridges is another Linux game launcher and it&#39;s super-clean</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing we're not short on, it's launchers. There's some kind of launcher for everything including Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and more. Now there's also Cartridges.</p>
<p>First impression is surprisingly good with this one. The interface is impeccably clean and clear, with options to import games from other sources like Steam, Heroic and others. It works damn well too without any fussing around. Although you will need to add extra sources for it to scan, if you're not using the defaults (like extra Steam game install folders). Importing is blazingly fast too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17890729111683298453gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17890729111683298453gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manually adding and editing games.</li>
<li>Importing games from Steam, Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and itch.</li>
<li>Support for multiple Steam install locations.</li>
<li>Hiding games.</li>
<li>Searching and sorting by title, date added and last played.</li>
<li>Automatically downloading cover art from <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/" target="_blank">SteamGridDB</a>.</li>
<li>Searching for games on various databases.</li>
<li>Animated covers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Might be worth a look if you're after something <em>simple</em>, that will bundle all your games from different sources.</p>

      <title>Typing Tempo challenges you in a 41-key typing rhythm game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>If you enjoy rhythm games and think you're a master typist, you may want to take a little look over at the new release of Typing Tempo. Giving you 41 keys worth of button-mashing, you likely don't need an introduction to rhythm games. You hit the correct key at the right time to progress through each track. Looks like it can get pretty challenging in the harder modes too.</p>
<p>"The Typing Tempo music library contains more than 30 upbeat and energetic tracks, including genres such as Future Bass, Hardcore, House, and more! With 100+ handcrafted levels, Typing Tempo has plenty of content to play from the get-go. You can also add your own music and levels to play, which can be created with Typechart Studio, a simple but powerful chart editor for the game, which is included as a Steam Tool."</p>
<p>You can see what to expect from it below:</p>

      <title>GOG reveal some stats on how they&#39;re doing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game store <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> has a new <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/gog_2023_update_2_facts_and_numbers_of_2022_copy3" target="_blank">blog post</a> up detailing how they're doing, and it seems like things are starting to go a bit better for them. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">Back in 2021</a>, I reported on how in the CD PROJEKT financials, it showed that GOG was losing money, so it seems they may be starting to turn things around a little bit.</p>
<p>In their new post, they showed that for 2022 they have seen an 11% increase in active users across all of GOG services with an 18% increase in their overall user base. However, GOG Galaxy only "remained consistent", so it seems they aren't seeing much growth for their launcher. They're also reporting a net profit of $1.2M USD, noting they're losing around 4% due to suspending operations in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>Nothing close to how they were doing in 2020 though, which they attribute the spike that year to Cyberpunk 2077 and COVID-19 increasing sales due to people being at home more.</p>
<p>As for their market split they're seeing 53% from Europe, 37% from North America, 4% Asia, 4% Australia and New Zealand and 2% elsewhere.</p>
<p>The amount of games releasing on GOG has been increasing every year too, although it's nothing close to what Steam has, since GOG do a little more curation on what they accept (which is at times a little weird on what they deny). From 296 releases in 2018 up to 684 in 2022.</p>

      <title>Dead by Daylight now works on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some potentially great news for Dead by Daylight fans, as it <em>seems</em> Behaviour Interactive have finally made the switch with their anti-cheat to allow Steam Deck and Linux desktop players in.</p>
<p>It was noticed by users around a week ago, with reports across <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/381210" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/132m9lq/dead_by_daylight_steam_version/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> mentioning that it now works. We've been in this situation before though, with this game specifically and multiple others, that suddenly work after an update. Usually, a day or a few days later the anti-cheat begins to kick Linux desktop and Steam Deck players. In this case though, that didn't seem to happen.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/steam-dead-by-daylight-is-now-working-on-deck/" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> are reporting they've had the PR team from Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive email them, stating it is intentionally working. However, the developer has made <em>no</em> public announcement on this anywhere, and they <em>haven't</em> replied to my email on it as of yet. Until they do give some public word on it, I would still take it with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The question is: if the report is true - <em>why</em> aren't the developers talking about it? Seems odd. A lack of confidence right now perhaps? Silent testing to see how it goes? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>Giving it a test run myself and it does indeed now work just fine with Proton 8.0-2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266768461683282289gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266768461683282289gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above running on Fedora KDE 38 on Ultra details, it's very smooth at 2560x1440 on my Ryzen 5800X + NVIDIA 2080 Ti system. Absolutely no issues observed there, so it's looking really nice. Not sure how much my heart can take with a game like this though — phew, what a rush when you're discovered and you have to run away.</p>
<p>Testing it out on Steam Deck too pictured below, the result of it working with Proton 8.0-2 is the same. On Medium details, with resolution bumped up to 100% it runs very smoothly there too. Not a big surprise though, since the environments are pretty small.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14388498421683283767gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14388498421683283767gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Hopefully we'll see an announcement on it officially soon. </em></p>
<p>You can buy Dead by Daylight from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-by-daylight?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, here's a video of it running on Steam Deck with my thoughts on this:</p>

      <title>Discord username system changing to make it easier to find people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After years of technical debt, Discord has <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames" target="_blank">announced</a> a big change is coming to their username system to make it easier to find the people you want to connect with.</p>
<p>Currently, you have your username followed by a bunch of numbers. It's not an ideal system, as they said themselves, "our current usernames can often be too complicated or obscure for people to remember and share easily". So they're changing it to be a bit more like Twitter and other platforms where you have @username instead. You'll still be able to change your display name to whatever you want though.</p>
<p><em>This is a good time to tell you to <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">join the GamingOnLinux Discord</a> right?</em></p>
<p>When the change comes in, your username will need to be unique and they said it will roll-out over the coming weeks. You'll get an in-app notification when your time comes to do the change-over. It will take several months for them to get through everyone, so you might be in for a bit of a wait on it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this system is received. It can easily end up with the same problems other places have, with people impersonating others by nabbing their tag used on another platform. Discord will need to be careful on this, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see them eventually roll out their own verification system too due to this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Open source physics-based tabletop sim &#39;Tabletop Club&#39; gets an official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bunch of early testing builds, the developer of the free and open source tabletop sim Tabletop Club has announced the first stable release. While this is the first "official" release, it's only the beginning for the project. It's already quite playable, and easy for you and friends to jump into thanks to it not requiring an account, just a hosted room code you can send to friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2598023611683210305gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of what's already planned for future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved behaviour for in-game objects like boards and containers.</li>
<li>More intuitive asset pack creation and management within the game itself.</li>
<li>An online asset pack database for creators to upload content, and for players to automatically download from.</li>
<li>A Lua scripting API for custom behaviour.</li>
<li>Migration to Godot 4.0, which should bring better performance and improved graphical fidelity.</li>
<li>Expansion to more platforms, including the web and mobile devices. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the release <a href="https://drwhut.itch.io/tabletop-club/devlog/523502/release-v010-humble-beginnings" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the developer explained why it was created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I want to thank everyone, from my friends who helped shape and test the game, to those who have contributed code, assets and translations, and to whose who have played it even for a little bit - this genuinely would not have been possible without your support. For context, I started this project knee-deep in the middle of the COVID pandemic since I was not able to play board games face-to-face at the time. At the same time, the various lockdowns were taking a huge toll on my mental health, which I did not realise until it was too late; the effects of which I am still feeling to this day. For me personally, not only is this a project that allows me to play board games with my friends, but it is also proof. Proof that no matter how bad it gets, no matter how low your self-esteem gets, you're still worth it. You can still make a difference in the world. Even if by modern standards most would call me a "failure" or a "wreck", it's all relative. This is something I've made, and I'm damn proud of it.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Soul Survivors is a refreshing skill-based time-survival Vampire Survivor-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing my quest to have no free time ever, I have been checking out Soul Survivors that's now available in Early Access. It may be yet another (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">there's lots now</a>) Vampire Survivor-like but that's not a bad thing at all. In fact, I'm actually rather enjoying Soul Survivors. Stride PR sent over an key and my early impression here is that it's really fun.</p>
<p><em>On desktop Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 8 and Proton 7.</em></p>
<p>It has all the basics of these popular horde games but there are some key differences. It's definitely a whole <em>lot</em> more skill-based than just the movement-dodging basics found in Vampire Survivors, especially with the different classes actually being very different to play. The current version has a mid-range fighter which is pretty standard, plus a Necromancer that spawns creatures you keep alive by picking up flesh piles. The Necromancer also has a physics-based spiked flail that moves based on your own position, so you can spin it each side or all around you based on your movement. The Necromancer has been a lot of fun to play as, with you swinging the spiked flail around as a skeleton runs around doing your bidding, while also firing off various spells.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13468808141683201195gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13468808141683201195gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - Soul Survivors on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Enemies actually have various different behaviours too. There's the usual hordes that chase you, enemies that will dart at you, enemies that teleport around you, vines that will hold you in place requiring you to quickly mash the direction buttons to break free.</p>
<p>Lots of clever little changes, make it worthwhile to play. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ubXculnoFNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ff6c0d3958fa91978d3c33097a4d6d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ubXculnoFNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Then you come to the boss system, each map has a specific set of bosses to fight and when you beat them, the game sudden warps into what they call Cursed Mode, where every minute a new curse on you or the world will increase the difficulty making it thoroughly interesting and frantic to keep going longer once you finish a map. So while there is gated progression for maps based on the bosses, each map is also endless and repeatable with it being quite dynamic at the end.</p>
<p>Another fun little addition is the money snail you chase around, which drops lots of gold for your character persistent upgrades. There's plenty of other ways to get gold from crates and other creatures, but the money snail was a funny addition.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17186964061683199879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17186964061683199879gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Soul Survivors on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>As you progress through a level, there's temporary items you can pick up too. Some might have you throw bombs constantly for a few seconds, some might make your Necromancer flail massive and plenty more. Lots of little things that add up to a really fun experience. Vampire Survivor fans won't want to miss this.</p>
<p>“Since beginning development on Soul Survivors, we have worked tirelessly to create a unique and entertaining time-survival roguelite,” said Sterling Selover of Stingbot Games, “Whether you’re familiar with the genre or are a fledgling adventurer, our blend of distinctive combat, persistent progression, and dark fantasy world-building has something for everyone.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002220/Soul_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework gives more detail on their AMD Ryzen laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Framework excited everyone over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/framework-reveal-new-laptop-with-modular-graphics-plus-an-amd-ryzen-model/" target="_blank">their big DIY laptop upgrades</a>, and now they're giving more detail on the Framework 13 Laptop with AMD Ryzen. They weren't able to originally reveal what AMD chips they would be using, but now they are.</p>
<p>They've now officially revealed they will be shipping with either the Ryzen 5 7640U or Ryzen 7 7840U depending on what you pick and you can pre-order them now with shipping expected sometime around Q3 this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/585990111683197045gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center">From their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ryzen 5 7640U processor has 6 CPU cores clocked at a base frequency of 3.5GHz and up to a max boost of 4.9GHz, while the Ryzen 7 7840U has an amazing 8 cores and 16 processing threads clocked at a base of 3.3GHz and up to 5.1GHz max boost. These are all Zen 4 cores, which feature AMD's fastest processor technology ever. These chips are fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process node, meaning that even with such high performance, they are also extremely efficient. We've designed the thermal system to be able to handle the processors at up to 28W continuous load if you need to do some heavy crunching too.</p>
<p>Ryzen-powered Framework Laptop users are also in for a treat when it comes to graphics performance. The Ryzen 7040 Series processors feature the latest generation AMD Radeon 700M Series graphics, the first AMD RDNA 3-based integrated graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has Radeon 760M graphics with 8 Compute Units while the Ryzen 7 7840U has Radeon 780M graphics with 12 Compute Units.  This means the Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series) can handle a range of modern game titles directly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For existing owners of a Framework Laptop, they will also be suppling the Mainboard so you can upgrade to it if you wish, or you can use it as a standalone computer too. The first two batches are already sold-out, and you can order either pre-built with Windows or the DIY edition to build it all yourself.</p>
<p>I don't need it…but I want it.</p>

      <title>AMD Render Pipeline Shaders SDK adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for game developers here and anyone tinkering around with graphics APIs, as AMD has announced the next upgrade to their Render Pipeline Shaders SDK and now it has Linux support.</p>
<p>This SDK was announced back in <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/rps_1_0/" target="_blank">December</a> in Open Beta, as a comprehensive and extensible Render Graph framework for graphics applications and engines using explicit APIs (like Vulkan and DirectX 12). The v1.1 update from <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/rps_1_1_linux_support/" target="_blank">May 3rd</a> adds in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux support for the base library and the RPSL compiler.</li>
<li>Support for dynamically loading Vulkan functions.</li>
<li>Support for latest stable Agility SDK 1.608.3.</li>
<li>Automatic marking of the discard flags to accesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some background on it from <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RenderPipelineShaders" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<p>"The AMD Render Pipeline Shaders (RPS) SDK is a comprehensive and extensible Render Graph framework.</p>
<p>Since the debut of explicit graphics APIs (Direct3D 12 and Vulkan®), Render Graphs (or Frame Graphs) have been proposed as an elegant and efficient solution to various problems such as generating resource barriers, managing transient memory and scheduling GPU workload. In practice, it is non-trivial to implement a render graph system from scratch, and it requires effort to keep it optimal according to hardware, API and content changes. Porting effects and techniques between different render graph systems may also consume extra engineering time.</p>
<p>The RPS SDK intends to make Render Graphs more easily accessible and to provide a generally optimal barrier generator and (aliasing) memory scheduler. RPS also tries to simplify Render Graph construction by extending HLSL with attributes and intrinsics to create a domain specific language for render graph programming. This enables opt-in applications to program Render Graphs implicitly via a high-level, declarative programming model, allowing users to focus on the render pipeline logic rather than node configuration details. We call the extended language "Render Pipeline Shader Language", or RPSL."</p>
<p>Always good to see more and more developer-focused tooling available for Linux, bringing down more barriers for developers working on games, game engines, drivers and more.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 9,000 games rated Verified and Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another juicy milestone for Valve with the Steam Deck, as it now has over 9,000 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Going by the list on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also takes into account those titles that have been removed for sale, which players can still download if they own the games the current status is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 3,276</li>
<li>Playable - 5,750</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,879</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping in mind, these are only those that have been through Valve's Deck Verified certification, there's plenty more that do work out of the box with no changes needed. Over time the numbers will naturally just keep rising, especially with upgrades to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer</a> along with some more Native Linux releases.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Deck Verified isn't perfect, there will be some games that are Verified that shouldn't be, and same again for Unsupported - some of them work and some don't. We really don't know how Valve actually test, as they've been a bit tight-lipped on it.</p>
<p>According to Valve this is the criteria for being Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input - The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display - The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seamlessness - The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System Support - If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A pixel-art version of The Sims? Sign me up. Tiny Life from Ellpeck Games and Top Hat Studios is now available in Early Access. It comes with full Native Linux support and it should work just fine on Steam Deck too.</p>

In this open-ended game you control a set of people that live together and you take care of all their needs, build them up, make relationships or whatever you want really. From what I played of earlier versions before this Early Access release, it showed a lot of promise and was already fun.</p>
<p>There's also now a brand new trailer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control your household and tell your characters what to do</li>

<p>It will be interesting to see if it finds an audience. People absolutely love these types of sims.</p>

      <title>Valve limits Steam store pages to 2 trailers before screenshots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't know about you, but I used to get a little annoyed by endless amounts of trailers on Steam pages that didn't really show much. Valve have been paying attention again to what players want to see.</p>
<p>Some developers went completely overboard, listing multiple years of update trailers before you even get a single screenshot, making it annoying to just quickly at a glance see if the basic style is your cup. Lots of "trailers" show little normal gameplay too and it was a growing problem.</p>
<p>Valve has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/5358762517221792488" target="_blank">announced</a> a change, so that only two trailers will be shown before screenshots now. All other trailers will be shown after the screenshots. This is a nice win for Steam customers, making it far less frustrating overall. It may seem like a <em>small</em> thing, but it really does make people bounce away from store pages if they're littered with trailers that don't show what people want.</p>
<p>Think about it - you go to a new store page for a random game and you want to see right away what it's like. Lots of trailers plastering various logo screens and intros before you really see anything — such a nuisance.</p>
<p>Another change Valve made is that trailers can now have a category and name tag, so developers and publishers can tell people what type of trailer it is so you can scroll to another if you really don't care about their cinematics for just one example. A small addition but could be useful if used correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4441127511683125669gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4441127511683125669gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17200584061683125670gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17200584061683125670gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Screenshot examples from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank">Portal 2</a></em></p>
<p>As Valve said on why it matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The display of trailers on Steam store pages have been updated today to address some frustrations we've heard from players when trying to find gameplay videos or navigate to screenshots. These changes include new logic that determines the order of trailers and screenshots, plus the ability to specify a category for each trailer to show to players.<br/>
<small>[…]</small><br/>
We have found that it wasn't clear to developers how best to manage trailers in order to provide the best experience for players. Many games have collected a great number of trailers over their lifetime of development and have made it harder for prospective customers to find the screenshots. At the same time, we know that players are interested in understanding a little more about the trailers they are watching. This update is intended to address both of these issues and help players more quickly learn about games they are interested in.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-1 released, mainly pulling in Proton 8 upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton has a new release out <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-1" target="_blank">with 8-1</a>, which is mainly pulling in a whole bunch of improvements from Proton 8 and Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>This is the version of Proton made and supported by the community, for the times where it may work better than the official Valve Proton, but it comes with less testing and may have its own issues. See more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Steam Play and Proton guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All build components rebased to Proton 8 experimental/upstream.</li>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest experimental.</li>
<li>wine-staging rebased on top of proton-wine 8.</li>
<li>proton-ge game patches and pending wine upstream patches rebased on top of proton-wine 8.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
<li>protonfix: No cutscene audio in Daedalic Games (Memoria, The Night of the Rabbit, A New Beginning - Final Cut) - (thanks marianoag).</li>
<li>protonfix: Megadimension Neptunia VII - (thanks snaggly).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other notes that were included to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>FSR is currently disabled again. It needs a massive rebase and same as before I don't know if it's currently possible to rebase/port it over to the new proton 8 build.</li>
<li>Having the nvapi hack configuration enabled in dxvk.conf seems to crash battlenet. Recommend removing it from the config for existing Lutris battle.net installations and related games.</li>
<li>Overwatch losing focus after death seems to be fixed.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

      <title>OBS Studio 29.1 is out now with AV1 / HEVC for YouTube</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for content creators here, as the excellent OBS Studio just released <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/29.1.0" target="_blank">version 29.1.0</a>. This brings initial support for AV1 / HEVC on YouTube.</p>
<p>There's various improvements elsewhere too of course but this is quite a big one, as it's potentially the future of streaming video and it's currently limited to YouTube for now as a Beta feature. This release also now supports Enhanced RTMP V1, which extends the RTMP protocol to support newer video codecs and HDR. Lots of future-proofing work going on in OBS Studio right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377001261683112301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377001261683112301gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Here's everything that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for streaming AV1/HEVC over Enhanced RTMP [YouTube/yuriy-chunak/derrod]
<ul>
<li>Enhanced RTMP V1 extends the RTMP protocol to support newer video codecs and HDR. More info at: <a href="https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp" target="_blank">https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp</a></li>
<li>Currently only supported by/enabled for YouTube as a beta feature</li>
<li>HDR is not yet implemented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for multiple audio tracks in Simple output recording [pkv]</li>
<li>Added a DLL blocking feature for Windows. This allows OBS to block problematic DLLs from attaching to OBS and causing freezing or crashes, for example 3rd party overlay hooks and outdated video capture devices. [notr1ch]
<ul>
<li>This blocks old versions of popular VTubing software virtual cameras that are known to cause freezes when accessing video capture device properties. If you are affected, please update to the latest version of your VTubing software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added settings to select the audio encoder for streaming and recording [tytan652]</li>
<li>Added an option to preload media sources used in Stingers to memory, to avoid frame skips during transitions [Jim]</li>
<li>Added Update Channels on macOS and updated Sparkle for smaller and faster updates going forward [derrod]</li>
<li>Added compatibility notices in the Window and Game Capture sources for Windows [derrod]</li>
<li>Added the ability to zoom browser docks with Ctrl - and + and the right click menu [WizardCM]</li>
<li>Added a setting to record in fragmented MP4 and MOV formats [derrod]
<ul>
<li>These offer greater compatibility than MKV while providing similar resilience against data loss due to crashes, running out of space, etc.</li>
<li>Fragmented MP4 and MOV files can be remuxed to regular MP4/MOV in cases where the former may not be read correctly (e.g. in older editing software)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for surround sound for AJA capture cards [paulh-aja]</li>
<li>Added ProRes 4444 (XQ) support for VideoToolbox encoder on macOS [jpark37]</li>
<li>Added lossless audio recording options (FLAC/ALAC/PCM including 32-bit float) [derrod]</li>
<li>Added indicator if an audio source is unmuted, but not assigned to any audio tracks [derrod]</li>
<li>Added AMD AV1 encoder to simple output mode [notr1ch]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for Linux, there were a couple of improvements like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve screen capture performance on Intel dedicated GPUs on Linux [kkartaltepe]</li>
<li>JACK inputs on Linux will now display "OBS Studio" in their name to clarify their origin. This may cause existing configured devices to stop working until updated by the user [univrsal]</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on shutdown with virtual camera on Linux [kkartaltepe/norihiro]</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the V4L2 source on Linux where a capture device's frame rate could be invalid, resulting in incredibly large log files [9p4]</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Push to Talk on Linux wouldn't work when assigned to secondary mouse buttons [KasinSparks]</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having some troubles with Epic Games on the Heroic Games Launcher? You weren't alone and a new hotfix is out to get it sorted.</p>
<p>For Epic Games, the issue was the captcha not being able to be completed, so 2.7.1 Hotfix #1 should solve that properly now. Some people noticed they were getting a blank screen on loading too, that should also be solved. Plus a problem with the Add Game blocking the Finish button was also fixed.</p>

<p>They've also added some keyboard shortcuts now too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command Or Control+R: Reloads the app.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+Q: Quits the app.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+Shift+I: Opens the dev tools.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+K: Opens the Heroic settings screen on the frontend.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+L: Opens the library screen.</li>

      <title>OpenRazer v3.6 brings support for 11 more Razer devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fantastic update to OpenRazer with <a href="https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/releases/tag/v3.6.0" target="_blank">version 3.6.0</a> bringing support for more Razer devices on Linux along with various improvements.</p>
<p>Like many other hardware vendors, Razer do <em>not</em> officially support Linux with their software to tweak things, thankfully the community keeps on giving with OpenRazer. Pairing up OpenRazer with an app like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a> can give you a pretty great experience. Polychromatic actually had a small update recently too with v0.8.1.</p>
<p>With this new OpenRazer release these devices are now supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Razer Laptop Stand Chroma.</li>
<li>Razer Blade 14 (2022).</li>
<li>Razer Core X Chroma.</li>
<li>Razer Basilisk V3 Pro.</li>
<li>Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro.</li>
<li>Razer Blade 15 Base (2022).</li>
<li>Razer HyperPolling Wireless Dongle.</li>
<li>Razer Pro Click Mini (Receiver).</li>
<li>Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro TKL (Wired and Wireless).</li>
<li>Razer Ornata V3 X.</li>
<li>Razer DeathAdder V2 Lite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's these improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plenty of cleanup in the daemon around the screensaver suspend/resume functions.</li>
<li>Prepare for better error handling in the kernel driver.</li>
<li>daemon: sanity check set_dpi_xy call for AVAILABLE_DPI devices.</li>
<li>daemon: clean up custom mouse get methods.</li>
<li>daemon: add effect_methods also for backlight zone.</li>
<li>pylib: don't init _matrix_dimensions when there's no matrix.</li>
<li>daemon: throw exception in get_matrix_dims when not available.</li>
<li>daemon: initialize self.POLL_RATES for all devices with poll rate.</li>
<li>pylib: deprecate poll rate constants.</li>
<li>Makefile: remove uninstall targets.</li>
<li>Makefile: Remove ubuntu_udev_install rule.</li>
<li>debian: replace python packaging hacks.</li>
<li>fake driver: ensure daemon cannot create new files.</li>
</ul>
<p>And these bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix volume wheel on Razer DeathStalker V2.</li>
<li>Fix macro LED not turning off on some devices.</li>
<li>Fix persistence for lighting on/off state.</li>
<li>daemon: Add missing methods to some devices.</li>
<li>daemon: fix Basilisk V2 matrix dimensions.</li>

      <title>Proton 8.0-2 out for Linux / Steam Deck fixing the EA app (yes, again)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has upgraded the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">newer Proton 8</a> that only launched for Linux and Steam Deck recently, with a bunch of bug fixes. This is all pretty standard stuff, a point release for the newest version of Proton for running Windows games. If you're confused about Steam Play and Proton see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>Seems on top of a few games needing fixes, that the EA app has once again broken requiring Valve to jump in to prevent a whole bunch of games suddenly not working.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in Proton 8.0-2, a bunch of which is pulled over from the recent Proton Experimental update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Baldur's Gate 3 getting stuck on a black screen in Vulkan mode.</li>
<li>Fixed Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition crashing on launch.</li>
<li>Fixed Path of Exile crashing.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.</li>
<li>Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be finicky.</li>
<li>Fixed Red Dead Redemption 2 and other games not starting after switching from Proton Experimental to stable.</li>
<li>Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How to update?</strong></p>
<p>It will show up as an update to Proton 8 in your Steam Downloads. Just update it as you would any other app / game on Steam.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it?</strong></p>
<p>You can select Proton 8 in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu of any game when you tick the box.</p>
<p>Changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder for Desktop Linux users - Proton 8.0 requires your GPU to support Vulkan 1.3. Steam Deck doesn't need to worry about that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Additionally, as a heads up, it seems Proton 8 might potentially <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6740" target="_blank">break</a> with some Easy Anti-Cheat games. Something to keep an eye on if you've switched any games with EAC over to it.</p>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 has one final content update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cellar Door Games are saying farewell to Rogue Legacy 2, with one final major content upgrade out now with The Swan Song. They had originally planned to move on earlier but they just couldn't help but do a little bit more. Even though they're moving on, it may still get some small patches to fix up issues as they appear.</p>
<p>Some highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3 New Ways to Play</strong> – Fans of the original Rogue Legacy may be familiar with the game’s hardest achievement, Thanatophobia, which required the game be completed in 15 lives. Well, we’re bringing it back as an official Special Game Mode, alongside two other modes that truly spice up the experience. Thana-two-phobia takes the original challenge and dials it to 11, with Prime bosses and harder biomes, while True Rogue pits you against the gods of RNG. This mode randomizes your character, drops you in random biomes, and tests how far you can get on a single life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dream A Little Dream</strong> – Deep within the shadows of an oppressive Kingdom lies the faint light of hopes and dreams. This latest update will be introducing Dreams, unique experiences similar to Scar Challenges that allow you to play out the fantasies of some of the most iconic characters in the game. What those fantasies are you will have to discover on your own. *Unlike Challenges, Dreams do not count towards earning certain achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fables For All</strong> – We’re completing the cycle and adding three new Fabled Weapons in this final update. Bring both shock and awe to your foes with Mjolnir, strike fear into their hearts with a hand puppet, or just take on the righteous tides with your surfboard. With the addition of these remaining Fabled Weapons, all Classes in the game now have one tied to them in the Soul Shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customization is the Spice of Life</strong> – To wrap things up, we are adding some minor customizations for both new and long-time fans of the PC/Mac/Linux version of the game. The first is the ability to add your own custom localizations. Please note that due to the nature of font generation, the feature is only available for languages in Latin or Cyrillic. We’re also adding custom seeds for speed runners, along with ways to validate them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the update trailer: </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-dV_OLQkcwk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a80a2996ee97a79cce782188060fe394.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-dV_OLQkcwk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Playing it for a while after release, I can see why people love the game. The design is fantastic and it looks super crisp. Tough as heck for lots of it though, really needs a lot of time to learn all the little enemy encounters and to get good at the tight platforming skills required. With nearly 12,000 user reviews on Steam and a Very Positive rating, this seems like a good send off.</p>

      <title>Animated series in the works for Vampire Survivors, plus big upgrade upcoming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only will Vampire Survivors get another content upgrade and a small patch later this month but an animated TV show is currently in the works.</p>
<p>Clearly the developers are doing well, and not really a huge surprise, since Vampire Survivors is one of the biggest indie hits in the last year. With an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over 185,000. Anyone who enjoys it I'm sure can attest to have utterly captivating it can be to play.</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3717201559848963709" target="_blank">Steam</a> about the animated show, the developers said they've pulled in a company called Story Kitchen, whose team includes Derek Kolstad (John Wick) and Dmitri M. Johnson (Sonic films). So they have help in the industry but studio founder Luca Galante mentioned:</p>

<p>As we all know, the most important thing in Vampire Survivors has always been the story, so we are very excited for this and we hope you are too! It’s still early days for the show, but I can already say that we will be involved so that we can ensure it doesn’t have any vampires (probably) and they will only cast the finest garlic. While we will be involved, this won't affect game development in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't actually mean it will happen though, as <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/vampire-survivors-video-game-animated-television-series-story-kitchen-luca-galante-poncle-trailer-1235340337/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reported they're searching for a writer and they still need some network to actually pick it up and buy into it. So it may never happen but given the popularity of the game, it may prove popular.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126313641683037307gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126313641683037307gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the game, a small patch is coming this month and then a <em>bigger</em> v1.5 content patch is planned to come later with new stages and relics but no dates set. They did say the 1.5 patch will have something different, as they keep experimenting with things like previous updates.</p>
<p>While all of this is going on, they're still working through their game engine upgrade too, which you can <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1794680/discussions/3/5769714637082190371/" target="_blank">try in Beta</a>.</p>

      <title>Combat Master is a cheesy indie free to play Call of Duty</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heard of Combat Master? It's a free to play first-person shooter released on Steam in late April and now it has Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Designed to be like a much cheesy faster Call of Duty, one that it's optimized for lower-end systems, it doesn't have anywhere near the level of graphics of the current-gen shooters. It's also a game that was <em>primarily</em> made for mobile it seems, that they've ported over to PC and just recently they added Native Linux and Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797079801683034929gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797079801683034929gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Notes from the latest update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Max players increased: 5v5 and 10 players lobbies are here!</li>
<li>Lightning speed loading time!</li>
<li>Steamdeck release, Linux + SteamOS.</li>
<li>New settting "Toggle Sprint" for Keyboard players.</li>
<li>Set "Huh" jump sounds volume.</li>
<li>Sniper Rifles now deal more damage over distance.</li>
<li>Customize color of Armor Icon in UI.</li>
<li>Far away shooting sounds are now louder.</li>
<li>Invert Y-axis setting.</li>
<li>Warehouse map clipping fix.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said the "CombatZone" is coming soon, so probably their own low-end take on a BR like Call of Duty Warzone.</p>
<p>It certainly won't win any awards for originality, and it really is pretty much a bargain-bin poor man's Call of Duty attempt by a small team. That said, it's popular on mobile and even on Steam it seems to regularly have multiple thousands playing it at any time so it seems to have already found an audience. Alfa Bravo Inc (the developers) even say they're just "enthusiasts" who have a "special love for firearms" and the gaming industry with "No corporates" involved.</p>

      <title>Seems the big Chinese surge on Steam is over - Steam Survey for April 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">latest</a> Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for April 2023, and it shows that things have calmed down again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/the-latest-steam-survey-had-a-huge-surge-of-simplified-chinese/" target="_blank">I reported earlier last month</a>, that the details they had for March 2023 looked really off. It showed a massive surge in Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam with it becoming top, along with Windows 10 surging up over Windows 11 as well. It was all a bit odd. Valve never issued any corrections though, or announced any issues with it at all.  </p>
<p>For April 2023, things have settled down again with Linux back to 1.32% (+0.48%), macOS back to 2.30% (+0.89%) and Windows at 96.38% (-1.37%). Languages changed dramatically again too with Simplified Chinese dropping back down to 25.03% (26.60%) so English being once again the top language used on Steam.</p>
<p>When filtering the April 2023 survey over to Linux here's the current most popular ways to game:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 22.77% +1.57%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 10.84% +1.23%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.79% -0.57%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.61% +0.51%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.25% -0.70%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 4.97% +4.97%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.86% +3.86%</li>
<li>Other 33.90% -10.89%</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's clear the Steam Deck is currently beating all other ways on Steam for playing games on Linux.</p>

      <title>FNA gets Direct3D 11 support on Linux using DXVK and vkd3d</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun for game developers and game porters looking at Linux and Steam Deck here, as <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> has released a major upgrade that has early support for Direct3D 11 on Linux. <em>FNA powers quite a <a href="https://www.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Tools#01_FNA.txt" target="_blank">lot</a> of games, and is used to help port games over to Linux as well.</em></p>
<p>In the latest FNA release <a href="https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/releases/tag/23.05" target="_blank">23.05</a> it brings Linux support for Direct3D 11 rendering in Alpha. How? Making use of DXVK-Native (which is now just part of <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> itself) and vkd3d. You might be wondering, and I certainly was - why? Well, developer Ethan Lee wrote on their <a href="https://icculus.org/finger/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">blog-thingy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was really excited to help with this for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was an excuse to work with CodeWeavers' programmers again</li>
<li>Having a Linux-native HLSL-&gt;DXBC compiler has been on every porter's wishlist forever (as <a href="https://github.com/icculus/mojoshader/commits/main/mojoshader_compiler.c" target="_blank">Ryan can attest to</a>)</li>
<li>It was also an excuse to start helping Joshua Ashton with making D3D9/10/11 a runtime provided by operating systems, as well as the Steam Runtime</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>While Valve still isn't prioritizing native, that hasn't stopped others from working on it independently - it's this cooperation that allowed the FNA team to release what I'm badly naming <strong><em>"The FNA3D D3D11 Linux Alpha"</em></strong>! Available on <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">the FNA website</a>, this is a supplementary archive for fnalibs.tar.bz2; by updating fnalibs and bundling linux_d3d11, you can now pass <code class="inline-code">/gldevice:D3D11</code> as a launch arg, and it will use dxvk with the native Linux binaries. Is it any better than our native OpenGL/Vulkan renderers? Maybe! Is it still cool even if it isn't better? Sure! The main goal of this feature is that it showcases what's possible for studios using D3D that want to make native versions, since <em>somebody</em> needs to tell everyone that this is an option, and I don't see anyone else doing that, so... here we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19902407871683030873gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19902407871683030873gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is Streets of Rage 4, a shot taken from Lee's post about it showing it running with this change to FNA. Below a bunch of screenshots Lee further explained once their TODOs on it are done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That will effectively fulfill my vision for what all of the recent DirectX work could be doing for native: Provide a built-in Direct3D runtime and HLSL compiler in distributions, just as we already do for other graphics libraries and shader languages, so that developers can target native Linux binaries without having to statically bundle what amounts to an entire graphics driver inside their game. The samples above may not look super cutting edge, but even small developers can make use of these features to improve energy efficiency for the new handheld PC craze, as well as improving on the usual performance and stability concerns.</p>
<p>And of course, I'm still supporting OpenGL as always, and the FNA team is still heavily invested in <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shader_tools/blob/main/docs/README-SDL_gpu.md" target="_blank">SDL_gpu</a>, but this has been a fun thing to work on in between SDL_ActionSet work and some other console projects that I've been working on in the background. I hope the work will help continue to build a platform that developers feel confident shipping native games on, and maybe Valve will get excited about it too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will certainly be interesting to see what becomes of this, and perhaps if more developers look towards something like DXVK and vkd3d it could help bring down costs when it comes to porting. Although for bigger developers that largely depends on what happens with the Steam Deck and Linux desktop user share over time, it has to be worth it for them.</p>

      <title>Another Steam and Steam Deck Beta brings fixes and Steam Input improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the huge update recently that overhauled the Steam Overlay, Valve has put up another Steam and Steam Deck Beta to fix up lingering issues and upgrade Steam Input.</p>
<p>For the May 1st update on Desktop here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3705942560795699113" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed -silent command-line option not working.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to http transfers.</li>
<li>Fixed opening systray menu for certain monitor configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Menus now work in the desktop overlay.</li>
<li>Added binding listener dialog that lets you bind inputs by hitting a mouse button, keyboard key, or gamepad button.</li>
<li>LED Color/Brightness Action reinstated as a bindable action. Find the Action settings inside the Game Pad tab when selecting an action binding (available on controllers with LEDs only).</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator not fully closing when backing out via gamepad in the Desktop overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator opening layout previews in a new window instead of directly in the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed cases where alt-tabbing between the stand alone instance of the desktop configurator and a game would not update the in-game layout.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed windows not grouping together in the taskbar.</li>
<li>Fixed pinning a steam window to the taskbar resulting in a shortcut that could not launch steam.</li>
<li>Fixed association of steam windows with the steam.desktop application entry.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The taskbar issue was quite a little nuisance, nothing truly breaking but annoyingly all the same so glad to see that fixed quickly (and yes it is actually fixed, I checked).</p>
<p>Over on Steam Deck the changes are basically the same, since Valve now share a lot of the code between them, something they were keen to highlight in the recent major update so it makes implementing features a lot easier for them and they can bring the features to PC and Steam Deck faster. These are the Steam Deck <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3717201559861560266" target="_blank">changes</a> (Beta and Preview channels):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash related to http transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Desktop Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed -silent command-line option not working.</li>
<li>Fixed windows not grouping together in the taskbar.</li>
<li>Fixed pinning a steam window to the taskbar resulting in a shortcut that could not launch steam.</li>

<p>What have you been playing? I only recently finished Fallen Order, hoping the sequel would be worth playing through but as we saw it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/star-wars-jedi-survivor-had-a-very-rough-launch/" target="_blank">another poor launch</a>. Major publishers just keep pushing things out that aren't ready. It didn't take long for the next major game to have a crap launch with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294810/Redfall/" target="_blank">Redfall</a> already on Mostly Negative.</p>
<p>This and more was covered in my recent news overview video:</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together huge sale, content update and hitting records</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Klei Entertainment have just released that latest update for their co-op survival game Don't Starve Together, it's a good one and it's on a massive sale too.</p>
<p>This is the biggest discount on Steam the game has ever had with 90% off until May 4th, putting it at only £1.09 / $1.49 / €1.49. Thanks to this, the player count for it has skyrocketed. The previous peak of 68,418 back in 2019 was smashed with it hitting a new top of 107,998.</p>
<p>It's not just the discount pulling people in though - it is a great game and the latest update sounds fun adding in rifts that appear, these will spawn creatures that are "very interested in gardening". Plus there's new powerful equipment to craft and this is only the first part of a trilogy of updates coming to the game as part of the "From Beyond" update arc.</p>
