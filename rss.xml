      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 comes to Steam in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Excellent news. PlayStation Publishing, Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software are bringing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 over to Steam on January 30, 2025. However, as with seemingly all Sony PC ports now, it will require a PlayStation Network Account despite being a single-player game and so will lock out various regions where the PSN is not supported.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wOJaeD0Si04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/974f5b363179323d38796366ea145b17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wOJaeD0Si04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Bringing Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales to a new audience on PC together with Insomniac and Marvel Games has been a great experience for us at Nixxes,” says Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes. “We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch.”</p>
<p>It will come in two editions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Edition:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The complete game</li>
<li>All the latest updates since Marvel Spider-Man 2’s PS5 launch, including:</li>
<li>14 new suits</li>
<li>New Game+</li>
<li>Ultimate Levels</li>
<li>New Symbiote Suit Styles</li>
<li>Time of Day options</li>
<li>Post-Game Achievements</li>
<li>Action Figure Mode in Photo Mode</li>
<li>Screen Reader and Audio Descriptions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The complete game with updates listed above</li>
<li>5 exclusive suits for Peter Parker</li>
<li>5 exclusive suits for Miles Morales</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Arachknight Suit (Peter)</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Shadow-Spider Suit (Miles)</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Web Grabber gadget</li>
<li>+5 skill points </li>
<li>Additional Photo Mode items</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They haven't yet revealed all the usual PC extras, which will no doubt come in a future blog post when they continue their marketing towards release like they've done for previous PC ports.</p>
<p>Okay, now I really need to actually play through Miles Morales…but I think a replay of the first one is also due.</p>
<p>How do we think this one will run on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite adds support for OneXPlayer plus improvements for ROG Ally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite is a SteamOS alternative that just keeps getting better. So while Valve have yet to release the Steam Deck version of SteamOS for others, Bazzite could be one of your best choices for Linux on handhelds.</p>
<p>The latest release has been <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-update-onexplayer-support-ally-goodies/4517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> under a new versioning scheme. They're no longer doing versions like Bazzite "3.8" (which this would technically be) instead matching the upstream Fedora versioning so they say this is "Stable (F40.20241013)" and the last before they swap over to the newer Fedora 41 for the base of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, what's new?</strong></p>
<p>Say hello to Bazzite on OneXPlayer devices like the X1 (AMD), X1 Mini, OneXFly variants and Mini Pro. They say it includes "full RGB support, back buttons, turbo button and a lot more custom features for them such as choosing what the turbo button and keyboard button do". Although there's still "a long way to go" with features missing like "fan curves, battery capacity limits, and vibration intensity + some other minor issues".</p>
<p>The fun part? OneXPlayer will be helping out as they said "we are proud to state that OneXPlayer will be helping us on that journey".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6159632261729273405gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - OneXPlayer X1 with the new Steam Controller emulation</em></p>
<p>They've also hooked up support for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hori-announced-a-special-gamepad-for-steam-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new HORI Steam Controller</a> too. Still haven't seen word on a release for it outside of Japan though, annoyingly!</p>
<p>Owners of the ROG Ally and Ally X will also be happy with this update as they've improved their "Modern Standby patch series" to <em>eventually</em> make it possible to allow background game downloads. As for what's updated for right now: it includes fixes for controller issues and sleeping, and hopefully it also fixed a bug where the Ally gets stuck at 6W after sleeping. Other improvements for the Ally series include "the frame limit slider to include all framerates from 12hz to 120hz AND to work while VRR is on or off" which is the code done in Gamescope <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/gamescope-gets-improved-rog-ally-support-hinting-at-more-progress-for-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I previously reported on</a> - so it was actually for Bazzite. On top of that they said there's a fix for "the VRR toggle to work alongside the framerate limiter".</p>
<p>Sounds like Bazzite development is going really well.</p>
<p>Be sure to see more on the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> to try it.</p>

      <title>Drova - Forsaken Kin is an impressive pixel-art action-RPG for you to check out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drova - Forsaken Kin from developer Just2D and publisher Deck13 was released recently, and if you love action RPGs it's one you need to check out. <em>Note: key provided by Deck13.</em></p>
<p>A grim dark fantasy pixel-art action-RPG that has gameplay inspired by Gothic and Morrowind where it won't hold your hand, with visuals inspired by Baldur's Gate 2 (so the publisher tells me). Very much its own beast though, one you're going to need to slow down and spend a bit of time with to take it all in, so it's great that it has such a good atmosphere that you won't want to put it down. That intro section especially really suckered me right in, I just wanted to know more and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ov9kmm4TM94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94774606b1e336051d35187885d47263.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ov9kmm4TM94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the combat, I have no doubt there will be a few soulslike comparisons to it. I would understand <em>why</em> if others said so, as the combat can be a little bit on the punishing side. There's a lot of game mechanics going on to understand too.</p>
<p>You have single and double-handed weapons (both melee and ranged), off-hand weapons, spells you get from scrolls, you have to dodge enemy attacks and watch for their tells to not get stomped, combo moves if you time things right and more. Weapons have to be drawn out to attack as well, or put away to actually inspect or interact with the world. <em>I've been genuinely surprised by how good Drova is.</em></p>
<p>Enemies don't scale to your level either, so if you get lost (and you probably will) you're going to need to be careful. Walk off too far before you're ready, and something will probably make a meal out of you.</p>
<p>I like the exploration side of it too, where you go into a special inspect mode to be able to see a bit more, although you cannot attack while you're doing so. But, it enables you to often find certain items and enemies hidden away by trees, bushes and more. Speaking of exploration and its inspiration, prepare to get lost. The map system is deliberatly rubbish, with the map just being pretty basic and you need to manually place markers with ink purchased from vendors. So you need to stock up and pay attention while exploring, and remember to mark your map.</p>
<p>Since it's an RPG, it does have a level system too, however, you need to find certain NPCs to sort through your skills and abilities.</p>
<p>There's a few silly English grammar errors here and there in the writing but it doesn't really distract from the experience, not as much as some of the "hmms" and grunts from random NPCs while you're around them – that's quite annoying to hear repeated in the background.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>30 - 40 hours of playtime.</li>
<li>An interface which doesn’t tell you what to do.</li>
<li>Flow based combat system with multiple weapon classes and magic.</li>
<li>Tailored story based on your actions and dialogues.</li>
<li>Join one of two factions to survive in this world.</li>
<li>Unique pixel art style.</li>
<li>Seamless open world with no loading times attached.</li>
<li>Multiple possible endings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is playable on the Steam Deck although no rating from Valve yet. On Steam Deck it felt pretty good, and performed well in the sections I played. One problem was naming my character, with the keyboard needing to be manually pulled up and it didn't take the input correctly so hopefully they solve that.</p>
<p>Overall, a fantastic entry into the action-RPG genre worth exploring. Having a lot of fun with it and I think you will too.</p>

      <title>Russian roulette with a shotgun, Buckshot Roulette will add multiplayer on October 31</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buckshot Roulette is a clever game putting a spin on the lethal game of Russian roulette but with a shotgun and items to help you along the way. At the end of October you'll be able to betray your friends too.</p>
<p>I was absolutely hooked on this when it came to Steam, and now perhaps I will be again. The short rounds mixed with the tense atmosphere — it's great. The multiplayer update lands on October 31st with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New items for strategic mutual annihilation. No pills included.</li>
<li>Round customization from more health points to item load outs for your convenience.</li>
<li>Brand new music from Mike Klubnika.</li>
<li>A bunch of new faces kindly provided to us by Volta Standard Electronics.</li>
<li>And the special sting of betrayal from your friends and loved ones.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Halls of Torment hits 1 million sales - more free updates planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Halls of Torment has been a great hit for developers Chasing Carrots, with it hitting 1 million sales on Steam. So great to see another game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> doing so well, especially nice that it is Steam Deck Verified and has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p><em>What is it? Imagine Vampire Survivors and the original Diablo had a baby. It's a little like that.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2218750/view/4512135723845697648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they said "It’s a great achievement for us so close after the release, and we’ve decided our journey won’t end here. We want to move further after leaving Early Access. We are currently working on some additional free content, fixing more bugs, and improving the game’s performance.".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JdQweTEsOUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12e755eacdb544b3aa69cb5d13f9b108.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JdQweTEsOUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they have a little <a href="https://open.codecks.io/hot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of some things they're working on. Plus they want to make a Supporter DLC that will include "character and UI skins, the soundtrack, and maybe an additional surprise" which they will use as a sort of test for DLC integration and if things go well they will use it to properly extend the game (along with free updates).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Red Rogue Sea looks like a deck-building pirating version of FTL: Faster Than Light</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I adored FTL: Faster Than Light and Red Rogue Sea looks like a sweet evolution of the gameplay with pirates and deck-building. Announced yesterday by Firemage Studios this is one to stick on your watch list for sure, I can easily see myself spending hours and hours in this one.</p>
<p>"Red Rogue Sea is a roguelike strategy game that puts you in the shoes of a pirate captain and their crew. You will manage your vessel as you sail through the treacherous waters of the archipelago, interacting with the scum that inhabits it. Make decisions that impact the outcome of various events and the overall narrative."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L4Ib1sWZqQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1682230db33b979365b5505ebaf07605.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L4Ib1sWZqQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock your fleet: Gain access to new ships and factions enabling the use of diverse strategies to outwit the fleet of the fearsome Admiral White.</li>
<li>Manage Your Own Vessel: To survive events and battles, you’ll need to command your crew with a firm hand and ensure that all ship systems and resources are used in the most optimal way. Prove that you’re a natural-born strategist!</li>
<li>Build Your Tactical Deck: In the heat of battle, you’ll command your crew to execute various actions through a deck of tactic cards that you can build and upgrade, gradually adapting it to your playstyle.</li>
<li>Immersive Narrative: Red Rogue Sea features a complex archipelago of islands inhabited by adventurers, wrongdoers, fortune seekers, and of course, ordinary folk. You’ll sail from island to island, interacting with different events and learning more about the place, its people, and the tales of legendary treasures sought by generations of pirates. Your actions will shape the course of your own story, leading you down different—and dangerous—paths.</li>
<li>Pirate’s Nest: In each game, you’ll create a unique captain and choose a ship to command. These seas are dangerous, and it’s likely your greed will eventually lead you to a watery grave... but that won’t stop you from trying again with another pirate captain!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200220/Red_Rogue_Sea/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> - it releases sometime in Spring 2025. Going by the Steam page it will have Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage arrives on Steam as Ubisoft return to Valve&#39;s store</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Things are not going exactly well for Ubisoft right now, and so they continue returning to Steam with Assassin's Creed Mirage released today. This follows on from its release a year ago where it was only available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>If you missed the news recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-and-star-wars-outlaws-head-to-steam-as-ubisoft-return-to-same-day-releases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft are moving back to same-day releases</a> on Steam! We have Star Wars Outlaws to come in November, and Assassin's Creed Shadows later since it was delayed.</p>
<p>As usual though it does use Denuvo with a machine activation limit, so if you're playing on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, you'll want to be careful on switching around <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> versions for it otherwise you'll get locked out for 24 hours. On top of that it also uses the Ubisoft Connect Launcher, which at times had some issues in Proton but it should work mostly fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IRNOoOYVn80"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/147bd1bbb109d0c60bb21b8a3e63e29c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IRNOoOYVn80" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for Steam Deck compatibility? No official Valve rating yet but Ubisoft stated in a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035570/view/4509883924033497574" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> it will get a "Playable" rating soon with an update planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is playable on Steam Deck. While it is currently displayed in the “Unknown category”, the “Playable” Steam Deck label will be coming in the next few weeks through a new update.<br/>
This next update will allow to launch the game on Steam Deck with low settings by default to best optimize the experience.<br/>
Note that applying higher settings may impact the experience and lead to instability when playing on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">50% off on Steam</a> until October 24th.</p>

      <title>Valve makes a big improvement for Native Linux games in a Steam Beta update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to the Steam Client Beta for Steam Deck and Desktop, with some Steam Input changes and some improvements for Linux too. It's the same across Desktop / Deck since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>The changes for Steam Input include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Always show the controller tab in app properties for non-Steam shortcuts.</li>
<li>Added Invert X and Invert Y to Mouse Regions.</li>
<li>Scroll Wheel mode can now be chosen from the dropdown in SIAPI games (Inside of Edit Loadout, not Quick Settings).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More interesting for us are the Linux-specific changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.</li>
<li>Native titles will execute in 'Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)' by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment.<br/>
This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions.<br/>
Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with "-compat-force-slr off" on the Steam client command line.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Taken from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/4507632124224426488?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for the October 17th Beta.</em></p>
<p>What exactly is the Steam for Linux runtime? From the <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/main/docs/slr-for-game-developers.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official guide</a> (linked from <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/platforms/linux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks</a>): "A collection of container environments which can be used to run Steam games on Linux in a relatively predictable container environment, instead of running directly on an unknown Linux distribution which might be old, new or unusually set up."</p>
<p>This way developers can ensure their Linux games run the same across different distributions. Now having Desktop Linux match Steam Deck by default, and letting developers pick, just seems like a thoroughly great change to me.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app adds support for Heroic Games Launcher and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer in-development open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app just expanded, and it's sounding awesome. Much easier modding is coming for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is <em>not</em> finished (nowhere near done) with the amount of games supported right now being limited, but they do keep gradually expanding it. Like with the version 0.6.2 release that's out now for testing, which has added in support for modding Baldur's Gate 3! That's in addition to Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>For Linux desktop and Steam Deck modders you'll be pleased to know this release also now supports the Heroic Games Launcher. This means games installed via Heroic from GOG can now be modded via this Nexus Mods app, although in this case the REDmod for Cyberpunk 2077 via Heroic was disabled but you can <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/Cyberpunk2077/#automated-deployment-for-redmods" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sort that</a> inside Heroic itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21406310501729174236gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods app on Linux</em></p>
<p>There's also been some UI improvements, and they're starting to show when a mod needs an update in the app too. On top of that there's some bug fixes like using the correct Wine prefix on Linux.</p>
<p>Really exciting to watch this app grow so we can finally have really easy multi-game modding on Linux / Steam Deck through a supported app. For now though, each update does need you to wipe things so it's more about testing and giving feedback to help shape the future but it's certainly getting there.</p>
<p>Just imagine in say a year or so when someone asks about modding on Linux / Steam Deck, and all you have to say is "use the Nexus Mods app" and away they go. Every little wall being smashed to make it easier will get more people to stick.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.6.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all the details and the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" rel="noopener" target="_blank">main GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Play Golf as household objects in the challenging House Hopper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>House Hopper instantly reminded me of WHAT THE GOLF?, taking the basic idea of Golf and turning it into something totally absurd.</p>
<p>In this one you're inside a house taking on the form of a household object, starting off as a dish scrubber and you have to flip yourself all around the house, across different surfaces and just attempt to keep going. It's basically a 3D physics platformer with the levels being the house itself. It's as funny as it is frustrating and with the demo live on Steam you should definitely give it a go.</p>
<p>The controls are a little funky to get used to, and there will be many mishaps where you've launched yourself just that bit too short or too far, and end up somewhere annoying — which is all part of the fun here. As you go through you also get to unlock more objects to become, each with their own unique shape that will change how you flip and land.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PmH17jK2hlA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4db5f53e66da020db338722315ae931.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PmH17jK2hlA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to seeing more from this game and from the developer Random Games Generator.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2209890/House_Hopper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version. The full game is due to release on November 8th.</p>

      <title>Melt Them All is a bit like a retro action rogue-lite Factorio with tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stripping down automation sims to the basics, adding in some tower defense and a little rogue-lite action with retro visuals and you have Melt Them All. Combining all the fun elements of each into a tiny package that's good for short bursts, and it's incredibly cheap too. <em>Note: this was a personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you can make fuel out of aliens, but you first have to destroy them and then mine away at their little bodies to get the ore. You have to drag around a cart to pick up the ore, and then gradually expand a production chain with lots and lots of conveyor belts.</p>
<p>There's a little survivor-like flavour here too with character buffs to unlock as you go as well, or perhaps a new item to be able to build to spend all your credits. A great distraction when you don't want something too in-depth but with fun game mechanics to keep you wanting to play more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TW9-Cfr2E5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11d388befe37ab2ac08add560e986ef7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TW9-Cfr2E5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tutorial isn't particularly great but easy enough, and the mechanics are all pretty simple so it doesn't really take long to understand everything you're doing.</p>
<p>Like a lot of smaller games on Steam, it's been a bit buried with only two user reviews. But it's a nice little mix-up on all the survivor-likes coming out lately.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252500/Melt_Them_All/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Goeland is like Untitled Goose Game but you&#39;re a seagull in a town that&#39;s a bit too peaceful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving off some early Untitled Goose Game vibes, Goeland is a non-linear open-world adventure where you're one of the most annoying birds on the planet - the seagull. <em>You can tell I live near the sea right?</em></p>
<p>Created by indie dev Bryan Martinet, you play as a mischievous seagull in a small sandboxy open world, interacting with characters and environment to solve enigmas, achieve quirky goals or take on self-imposed challenges and of course — poop on everyone.</p>
<p>In an email Martinet mentioned: "Earlier this year, I lost my job in the AAA game industry (Eidos Montréal) due to the waves of layoffs hitting the industry. I took it as an opportunity to create this game on my own. It’s been a challenging yet rewarding experience, handling every aspect of game development."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2sD3nLCHg4E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d74005a54abe8f258f01bbb87ef33fed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2sD3nLCHg4E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like a fun idea! After playing a bunch of the demo I'm looking forward to seeing what other chaotic things the developer adds in. Being able to fly around and having a lot of freedom to explore will be great. The demo area is of course limited, but this small slice is promising.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a mischievous seagull wreaking havoc on a quiet island.</li>
<li>Engage in open-ended, sandbox-style gameplay.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and complete objectives using stealth, creativity, manipulation.</li>
<li>Interact with various items and NPCs to cause chaos and amusement.</li>
<li>Shape and transform your surroundings based on your actions.</li>
<li>Help adorable stranded animals find their way to the ocean.</li>
<li>Enjoy charming visuals and a delightful, whimsical and dynamic soundtrack.</li>
<li>Experience dynamic reactions from the environment and characters.</li>
<li>Explore multiple areas within the island, each with its own unique challenges.</li>
<li>Interact with charming characters and assist them in their quests.</li>
<li>Enjoy relaxing gameplay with no time limits or pressure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo has a Native Linux version that works great. Have a look and try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531840/Goeland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> now. The full game release date has not yet been announced.</p>

      <title>Dunebound Tactics really is one to watch for strategy fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dunebound Tactics has been announced by Terahard Studios and if you're anything like me and love your strategy games, this looks like one to watch for sure.</p>
<p>After reading up on it and checking out the trailer I'm getting a sort-of Sunless Sea / Sunless Skies vibe from this with the exploration and interactions, except you're in some sort of sand-crawling ship and there's the addition of turn-based tactical combat with plenty of destruction.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v1YgHbn-ye8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1849f0a2d4712b93b2182b76af0218cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v1YgHbn-ye8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Personally, I'm a huge tactics fanatic. We built our very own tactics engine with RPG elements from the ground up for Dunebound Tactics! I'm excited both for the technical innovations as well as the freedom we gave our game designers to create an amazing experience. The art in this game is the best we've managed so far connecting all the little details to squeeze performance and quality." — Aris Tsevrenis, CEO of Terahard Studios</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Each Run a Stepping Stone -</strong> Your previous mishaps, crushing defeats or triumphs will contribute to your next run, either in the form of modules, or potentially even survivors, as you find the previous caravan’s wreck.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic world generation</strong> <font color="#e0e0e0"><strong>-</strong></font> Whether in combat or roaming through the sands - battlefields, locations or quests will challenge you in new and unexpected ways, making each run unique.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Turn-Based Combat -</strong> Manipulate a fully destructible and reshapable terrain to mold the battlefield and seize the advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Friends -</strong> Rescue &amp; recruit lost souls to bolster your numbers, but remember, your caravan has limited seats. With a roster of 15 distinct classes and 16 unique traits that enhance skills, stats, or add abilities, every run offers a fresh experience.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel</strong> - Decide whether to heal your wounded in the infirmary after battle takes its toll, or extract the Elios from their bodies, leaving them mere husks, to fuel your ambitions or power the caravan’s engine.</li>
<li><strong>Foes</strong> - Between the Imperials and the Arcanists, your party must face 40 enemy classes in a desperate fight for a better tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

      <title>TRON: Catalyst announced from Bithell Games and Big Fan Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/devolver-launch-big-fan-games-a-label-for-indie-devs-to-work-on-licensed-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Devolver Digital announce Big Fan Games</a> to get more games made from major licenses (tv, movies, comics etc) and the first is TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p>This debut project from Big Fan Games brings in Bithell Games to make it who also worked on Thomas Was Alone, John Wick Hex, Tron: Identity and others. Set in the same world that Bithell Games created for Tron: Identity, it's a standalone game though that you can enjoy without playing Identity.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Disney TRON: Catalyst, players are introduced to Exo, a highly resilient and resourceful program with an incredible ability to initiate time loops. With this newfound power, Exo takes on the overlords of a crumbling Grid all while evading Conn, a malevolent agent of CORE. Exo must gain control over her mysterious abilities and uncover the unexplained ‘Glitch’ that threatens the Grid.</p>
<p>As Exo, players will battle on-foot and on Light Cycle to complete missions and gain crucial insights that will help them on their quest. While learning from her mistakes, Exo ​ will also need to navigate warring factions to unlock new paths and uncover the secrets of the Arq Grid."</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-16 released with mod support for various Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're modding Bethesda games on Linux / Steam Deck, GE-Proton 9-16 could make things a little easier for you.</p>
<p>As your reminder: GE-Proton (or Proton-GE) a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons), and sometimes other special additions, but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>In GE-Proton 9-16 one of the main additions is a change to how Bethesda games will launch like the Fallout series, Skyrim, Oblivion and Starfield. If GE-Proton detects a known mod executable for these it will launch that <em>instead</em> of the original - something that will just save players a fair bit of messing around. Seems like a nice change!</p>
<p>Another addition is that games run with UMU (Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux), for using it outside of Steam like in Heroic Games, is that games will now have the <code class="inline-code">/mnt</code>, <code class="inline-code">/run/media</code> and <code class="inline-code">/media</code> and the user's home folder added as drives that games can see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7527689401729065035gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Skyrim</em></p>
<p>There's also a few other game-specific fixes, and the usual additions of new code from the official upstream projects.</p>
<p>Here's the full <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>import upstream makefile changes</li>
<li>import upstream proton changes</li>
<li>import upstream steam_helper changes</li>
<li>import upstream vkd3d-shader changes</li>
<li>update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>update vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>update dxvk-nvapi to e4bad70</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed issue with game_titles not being pulled correctly for UMU</li>
<li>game_titles are now looked up as part of included umu-database csv instead of trying to send online website api call</li>
<li>games run with UMU will now have /mnt,/run/media,/media/, and the user's home folder added as drives u:,v:,w:,x: respectively inside the prefix if they are not empty. This is to allow users to install or import games outside of the prefix more conveniently. A typical scenario for this would be if you have your games pre-installed on a different mounted drive, or somewhere else in your home folder outside of the prefix and you want to add them without reinstalling the game, OR if you want to install the game to one of those mounts instead of the C:\ drive inside the wine prefix. With steam, users don't really have to worry about this because steam handles the drive mounts and the install locations, however we found that outside of steam users were trying to use the Z: drive (which is symlinked to root (/)) -- which is of course containerized and read only, and therefore also unable to provide a proper drive size, resulting in users being told they don't have enough space. With the new drives added into the prefix it should fix this, allowing users to access their mount locations or existing game folders for installation or importing via the new drives instead of Z:.</li>
<li>Mod support for various bethesda games has been added (Thanks Root-Core). If a mod executable is found for bethesda games it will launch the mod executable instead of the original:<br/>
mapping = {<br/>
'22380': ('FalloutNV.exe', 'nvse_loader.exe'), # Fallout New Vegas<br/>
'22370': ('FalloutLauncher.exe', 'fose_loader.exe'), # Fallout 3<br/>
'377160': ('Fallout4Launcher.exe', 'f4se_loader.exe'), # Fallout 4<br/>
'22330': ('OblivionLauncher.exe', 'obse_loader.exe'), # Oblivion<br/>
'72850': ('SkyrimLauncher.exe', 'skse_loader.exe'), # Skyrim<br/>
'489830': ('SkyrimSELauncher.exe', 'skse64_loader.exe'), # Skyrim SE<br/>
'1716740': ('Starfield.exe', 'sfse_loader.exe') # Starfield<br/>
}.get(game_id, ('', ''))</li>
<li>protonfix added for metal gear solid 2 (thanks FranjeGueje)</li>
<li>protonfix for Kindom Hearts HD Remix added for steam version (already existed for egs version) (thanks Internetbestfriend)</li>
<li>protonfix added for Gothic Playable Teaser (thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>Star Citizen protonfix updated (no longer requires EAC workaround)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 1 source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Legacy, a rogue-lite from Cellar Door Games, that originally released in 2013 has now had the source code released. The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/CellarDoorGames/status/1846246914406195662" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Twitter / X the developer noted they've been working with game porter and FNA developer, Ethan Lee, to make this happen who will be maintaining it going forward.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8915973611729018609gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game is <u>not</u> open source though, to be completely clear on that. It's source available under a <em>custom</em> license with certain restrictions, much the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/01/vvvvvv-from-terry-cavanagh-has-the-source-code-opened-up-to-celebrate-the-10-year-anniversary/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VVVVVV</a> and is actually based on the license that Terry Cavanagh used for it. This is also only the source code, it does <em>not</em> include the assets - so you still need to own a copy of the game.</p>
<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/flibitijibibo/status/1846249473741410725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Ethan Lee posted on Twitter / X that they intend to take on community contributions to it, and they're in progress on upgrading it to use SDL 3 that's currently in Beta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3823223841729018862gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really great to see more developers open up the code for their older games. This way they can practically live on forever. It would have been even better if it was fully open source, but having it open like this is still a great resource for developer curious on what goes on behind the scenes to learn from as well.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a> for the source code.</p>
<p>You can buy the game from:</p>

      <title>Intel and AMD join up to form the x86 ecosystem advisory group to shape the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems AMD and Intel may be feeling the pressure from Arm? Today both companies announced the forming of a new x86 ecosystem advisory group to help shape the future of the platform.</p>
<p>It's not just them though they've pulled in Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) and Tim Sweeney (Epic Games), along with companies including: Broadcom, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat as founding members.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are on the cusp of one of the most significant shifts in the x86 architecture and ecosystem in decades – with new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future customer needs,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “We proudly stand together with AMD and the founding members of this advisory group, as we ignite the future of compute, and we deeply appreciate the support of so many industry leaders.”</p>
<p>“Establishing the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group will ensure that the x86 architecture continues evolving as the compute platform of choice for both developers and customers,” said Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are excited to bring the industry together to provide direction on future architectural enhancements and extend the incredible success of x86 for decades to come.”</p>
<p>Their plan is to come together to find new ways to expand the x86 ecosystem with their intended outcomes to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing customer choice and compatibility across hardware and software, while accelerating their ability to benefit from new, cutting-edge features.</li>
<li>Simplifying architectural guidelines to enhance software consistency and standardize interfaces across x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.</li>
<li>Enabling greater and more efficient integration of new capabilities into operating systems, frameworks and applications.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Valve still waiting on a &#39;generational leap&#39; for Steam Deck 2 - but it&#39;s coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve gave us the strongest wording yet that a Steam Deck 2 is actually real, although it's still clearly going to be some time away before there's enough of an upgrade.</p>
<p>Recently we had the news that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-officially-comes-to-australia-in-november/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck is finally going to release in Australia</a>, and so now Valve have another market opened up for future hardware launches. So, a few Australian websites managed to get Valve to open up a little to discuss the future and it's sounding good.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reviews.org Australia</a> here's what Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said about a Steam Deck 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to us, and we’ve tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence. We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that’s kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that’s only incrementally better. So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we’re excited about and we’re working on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also mentioned in the interview is how they really love seeing all the devices from other companies, even if they're not a fan of the constant device refreshes. There's plenty of other good stuff mentioned in the full interview so be sure to go give it a read.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the freshest news though if you've been following along, since I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously covered Valve's little handbook for the Asia launch</a>, that did make it seem pretty clearly like more was planned. Still, Valve reiterating it so <em>strongly</em> is a great sign.</p>
<p>Until then we've still got plenty to look forward to like the final release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> (it's in Beta) which will bring another big lot of system improvements. And, whatever this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ARM64 and Android stuff</a> is for (likely a new VR set).</p>

<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate is the latest game from the Szymanski crew who you might know from the likes of DUSK, My Friendly Neighborhood and other games. It's basically a Harry Potter rip-off that's pretty comically good.</p>
<p>I know calling it a rip-off might seem <em>harsh</em>, but — just look at it. I do mean it in the nicest possible way as well. What you get is an overly silly wizarding sandbox game to run around in and cause some ridiculousness either alone or with friends.</p>
<p>Testing it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>, it does work well. Although you need an extra install step before playing with the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime that pops up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17583098911728992207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Running around you can collect wizard biscuits, which are the currency here, that look suspiciously like delicious party rings. This allows you to buy things from the shopkeeper, rather than steal them and have them chase you down with a massive sword.</p>
<p>After a while I lost count of the amount of times I died. You can die in <em>so many stupid ways </em>it's pretty funny. From being bounced around and squashed between things, to stepping on pads and having the walls move and turn you into a pancake there's a lot to find. At one point I used the beginner spell on a random girl standing around, and she came up to me and just insta-slapped the life out of me — ouch.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy is going undercover again to topple the international crime syndicate run by Grumblemort. He must use his wits to infiltrate Grumblemort's wizarding school and crack the evil vault deep within the castle. Or, Wizard Boy could choose to ignore his mission entirely and instead use knowledge of spells and espionage to wreck havoc and destruction.</p>
<p>He can also team up with fellow Wizard Boys in cooperative(?) multiplayer to explore (blow up) the castle together.</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A multitude of spells to learn and inflict on others.</li>
<li>Physics-based mayhem.</li>
<li>Open-ended goals to accomplish (or ignore) however you see fit.</li>
<li>Online multiplayer.</li>
<li>Retro-themed third person action, straight from the days of Unreal Engine 1.</li>
<li>Landmines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It's janky bootleg Harry Potter that looks like it was made for the PS1 with silly physics. Give it a try.</p>

      <title>Tenebris Somnia looks awesome blending live-action cutscenes and retro horror</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a unique one here. Tenebris Somnia was announced from Andrés Borghi, Saibot Studios and publishing help from New Blood Interactive. They even pulled in Airdorf, creator of FAITH: The Unholy Trinity, to serve as Executive Producer on it.</p>
<p>It's a 2D survival horror adventure game like the classics with a feel like Silent Hill and Resident Evil mechanically. However, what really makes this one stand out is the blend of retro pixel-art main visuals for the gameplay, and then it totally flips with live-action cutscenes. It's…strange, but it <em>works</em> and when it jumps into a live-action scene it really does make quite the impact before it flips back to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Testing the demo on Kubuntu Linux, it worked perfectly with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton version 9.0-3</a> and I definitely think you're going to want to try it for yourself if you like puzzles and horror. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide</a> if you don't know how to use Proton.</p>

      <title>Be careful with pachinko roguelike Ballionaire as it might suck away your entire week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ballionaire from developer newobject and publisher Raw Fury has a demo up for Steam Next Fest, and you're really going to want to keep an eye on that clock when you hit play. It has already become my latest absolute obsession. </p>
<p>Inspired by pachinko machines but it adds in some roguelike flavour, and the result is something that has just completely captured me and I'm going to be playing it all night. Drop a ball down the vertical machine, where you've placed various triggers to try and build up a lot of money. It quickly turns into absolute chaos, with the ball bouncing around everywhere and it's just a thorough delight to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410606501728985610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410606501728985610gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ballionaire on Linux</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you go across various boards where you have to pay a tribute in money gained from the pachinko machine. Each tribute you manage to hit, will bring you to a new round where the needed tribute is higher, so it can get quite challenging. So it's up to you to build up the board, and hit various insane combinations that might even break the game to absolutely smash the goal and become a Ballionaire.</p>
<p>In a way it feels like a merger between Peglin and Balatro. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kJ4CLsPA31g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/062f41e5e0435749d7082e2e4fa8029c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kJ4CLsPA31g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Fun fact: it's another <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> game.</em></p>
<p>I fully expect this to be a <em>huge</em> hit at release. It's great to play with wonderfully inviting visuals and just so entertaining to see the ball get smashed around while you see your money ticking upwards. Especially nice when you've got a good combination going, and the ball just manically bounces between them all for a while, as you sit back and take a well-earned sip of your favourite drink and just watch it all happen.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and as far as I can tell it works to perfection. No release date just yet, but the publisher made it sound like it was <em>really</em> soon.</p>

      <title>Fractured Alliance gives off some real classic Command &amp; Conquer vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you adore your classic base-building real-time strategy games? You may want to keep an eye on the in-development Fractured Alliance. I grew up playing the likes of Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun and all the rest and so this one feels like it's whispering sweet things directly into my ear.</p>
<p>Looks to be something of a spiritual successor to me both in terms of game mechanics and the style of it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say, and it pleases me to see more game developers attempt to get more into this genre. Seriously, this looks and sounds like what could have been a lost Westwood game if they kept going. I need it.</p>
<p>Check out their new prototype trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zSf_0-ekIBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9568b7cd5243f9b34a2e2cb9b80a5430.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zSf_0-ekIBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Lots of different unit types, nice varied map styles, super weapons, weather effects and more — yep I'm sold.</p>
<p>At release they play to offer a full single-player campaign, along with various types of online battles too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2583660/Fractured_Alliance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. They also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/fracturedalliance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

      <title>The props fight back against the humans in Puropu Defense Squad </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PlayTogether Studio who made Run Prop, Run! and the Mad Experiments: Escape Room series have put up a demo and release date for Puropu Defense Squad. A mixture of a shooter and tower defense.</p>
<p>A curiously silly setting too. An alternate universe where Props have come alive. Yes, Props, the things you would disguise yourself as in certain hide and seek games. Now they must "protect their existence against Earth's relentless human invaders". You assume the role of an elite warrior of the Puropu Defense Squad and your mission is clear: build defences to stop enemies from reaching your precious Extractor, the lifeblood of your civilisation.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TTAv8w9G5DE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0644c92af68aa4b8d123d77910ebb395.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TTAv8w9G5DE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Getting some serious Orcs Must Die vibes from this, seems like a whole lot of chaotic fun. The good news is that it has a demo up now you can play for Steam Next Fest that was expanded with more content, and it will release with Native Linux support on December 9th.</p>
<p>Features (from their press email):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Action</strong>: Immerse yourself in a seamless blend of third-person shooting and strategic tower defense. Build a vast arsenal of traps, turrets, and barricades, each upgradeable to fend off waves of enemies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Characters</strong>: Choose from a diverse roster of quirky heroes, each offering radically different playstyles. Whether it’s the explosive might of Mr. Box, the tactical genius of Grey, the swift strikes of Tomusashi, the transpercing Ryush, or the blinding lights of Denkyu—every character brings something unique to the battlefield. Customize them by unlocking new talents in each hero's talent tree, and by acquiring a variety of items and XP-based upgrades to tailor your playstyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-op Campaign</strong>: Embark on a challenging campaign solo or with up to 3 friends. Use powerful abilities and clever tactics to defend your Extractor against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Unlock new items, characters, and content as you complete challenges. Tackle new difficulties in Elite, Heroic, and Infinite modes, where only the most strategic players will survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endless Replayability</strong>: After conquering the campaign, dive into infinite modes where waves of enemies become progressively harder. Master elite modes like Heroic and Infinite to prove your worth as a top defender. Compete for the top spot on global leaderboards in both solo and co-op Infinite modes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>That didn&#39;t last long - the Junk Store for Steam Deck has its Steam page removed (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/first-steam-deck-plugin-on-steam-will-bring-gog-and-epic-games-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A few days ago</a> I wrote about the Junk Store coming to Steam, a special plugin for Steam Deck to bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility unofficially - but it seems to be a short lived idea.</p>
<p>It is already available as a free and open source plugin for the Decky Loader plugin system, but this was going to be completely standalone, and a paid product for the convenience of just having it right on Steam.</p>
<p>Even though Valve had clearly reviewed the Steam page, and so would have seen what it actually was to even allow the page to go live, it seems Valve <em>may</em> have backtracked on that. It's not clear though if this was done by Valve, or by the developer, the Steam page is just gone. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3250950/history/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the note mentions "This app has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18469908521728978917gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18469908521728978917gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Junk Store</em></p>
<p>Perhaps not really surprising. While Valve do allow a lot of weird stuff on their store, a launcher that has a primary purpose of launching other games from other stores might have been a bridge too far.</p>
<p>I've reached out to both Valve and the Junk Store developers to find out exactly what happened, and will update if I get any reply from either party.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update - 16/10/2024 - 07:20 UTC</strong>: the Junk Store developers posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g4hi6x/its_true/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that it was Valve who took it down. It was taken down not due to the Epic or GOG features, but specifically because it modifies Steam itself.</p>
<p>Here's what Valve support said to them:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 44: The Legend of Kobo</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-43-demons-and-angels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 43: Demons and Angels</a></strong></p>
<p>A lot of early UNIX and therefore Linux games struggled with the fact that the X toolkit was geared towards constructing staid graphical user interfaces, rather than for the speed and flexibility needed by games. Both <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> as well as the <em>Linux Games &amp; Entertainment for X Windows</em> compilation included many valiant attempts, which while all being admirable in their own way, failed to sustain much in the way of scrutiny. One X11 game that does is <em>Xkobo</em>.</p>
<p>Inspired by Namco’s 1981 arcade title <em>Bosconian</em>, <em>Xkobo</em> was created by the Japanese coder Akira Higuchi and released for a diversity of different UNIX derived systems starting in 1995. The original source code tarball archive of the final 1.11 version from 1997 has build issues when trying to do so on newer versions of Linux, forcing me to use an older compiled binary from 1998 instead included in the xkobo-1.11-1.i386.rpm package to play the game.</p>
<p>For an X11 based game, <em>Xkobo</em> is remarkable in how smooth and fast it is to play. While having the expected limitation of being restricted to a small game window, the art itself is polished and the scrolling seamless. I am often not enamoured by "shmups" in this style, but the puzzle element here of tactically dismantling the enemy fortresses by targeting the coloured nodes helped to keep me engaged, at least until the game descends too close to being bullet hell.</p>
<p>Even then, <em>Xkobo</em> does mercifully allow you to start over from the stage after the one you last cleared when your lives run out. This means you can tackle the game in bursts, as <em>Xkobo</em> would wear out its welcome if it forced you to solve it all in one sitting. There are 50 stages to the game, although I have only cleared 22 of them so far myself. For those without the patience, you can also play through any stage with infinite lives through the use of the "-cheat" launch flag.</p>
<p>There is also a "-doublesize" flag that increases the size of the game window at the cost of using much more memory, but with 512 MB of RAM installed in my machine, I can go ahead and laugh in the face of danger. Even on my overpowered for the time computer however, the game will still slow down if a lot of explosions are drawn on screen at the same time. This can be further mitigated through the use of "-fast" flag, which again consumes more memory in exchange for a faster algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983347151728930889gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15983347151728930889gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15358656701728930890gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15358656701728930890gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>A modified branch of <em>Xkobo</em> by Kenneth Nielsen also exists which fixes the game to build with the new strong type checking found in later compilers; Nielsen would later merge this with a fork by Wolfgang Jährling which adds some new levels and enemies to the game. This formed the basis of the RPM packages distributed by Dag Wieers for use on later Red Hat Linux and Fedora releases, with most players likely completely unaware there had ever been any changes.</p>
<p>A separate fork of <em>Xkobo</em> by Masanao Izumo was also developed which added sound effects to the game, work which would later be built upon by David Olofson to craft <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> starting in 2001. This reworked <em>Xkobo</em> to use SDL as well as further modernizing the game. I was unable to get any version of <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> past 0.4.1 to compile on Red Hat Linux 7.3, which was when the game engine switched to OpenGL being loaded dynamically, but any version before that works.</p>
<p>Work on <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> continued past 2007, and the game can still be found packaged with many modern Linux distributions, but David Olofson himself has moved on to other projects. One of these was his more experimental <em>Kobo II</em> prototype, which eventually lead to the release of <em>Kobo Redux</em> in 2017. This is still available for purchase from itch.io, although further updates have stalled due to life and health challenges on the part of Olofson.</p>
<p>The more I played these expanded versions of the game though, for all of their bells and whistles, I could not help but feel that sometimes less is more. The original <em>Xkobo</em> is a great example of what can be done when you focus on just the core gameplay loop paired with a consistent set of art assets. It may seem simple when put against the variety of game modes and explosion of effects offered by its inheritors, but there is an elegance here that still shines through after all of these years.</p>
<p>There is a reason why SDL and SVGAlib, and to a lesser extent GGI and Allegro, were embraced by Linux game developers. Magic can come out of people working against imposed limitations however, and games like <em>Xkobo</em> succeed by this. This is not to say that a bit of pizzazz is always unwelcome, especially when you have your own multimedia toolkit to promote and the beer of your sponsor to sell. It is time for us to cut to commercial.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2024 edition is now live with lots of demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here! The big Steam Next Fest event returns to suck up all your free time, as tons of game developers hope you'll try out their demos. An event that can easily be overwhelming in sheer numbers, but a whole lot of fun to get a glimpse of what's to come next.</p>
<p>Valve's official trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T5WV8qqalew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc3dadc43df4545d75574aef9b000d0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T5WV8qqalew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As per usual I'll be going over and highlighting games individually over the next week on anything interesting I think that's worth a dedicated shout-out in an article. Something worth noting is that plenty of games that will have an official Native Linux version don't have a Linux demo, and there's a fair few that <em>do</em> have a Linux demo that for some reason don't show it. However, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> is a thing and will no doubt run most of them. <em>There's also a quite a number of games featured that don't have a demo at all - annoyingly, and some will only go live with the event.</em></p>
<p>Going over the press-preview here's a few that could be worth a look, just a bunch to get you started. Rather than pointing out the big obvious stuff you likely already know about, these could be gems to keep an eye on. Most of these are supposed to have Linux support at release too:</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 delayed again but a demo is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My most anticipated game of the year keeps running away from me. Streets of Rogue 2 is no longer entering Early Access on October 22nd, but at least a demo is out now.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2165810/view/7199658258492782196" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So first off, why the delays? Well, the TL;DR is “Big Open-Ended Game + Solo Programmer = Unpredictable Timeline.” October 22 seemed like a viable date back in July, but ultimately despite my best efforts, I felt the game needed a bit more time in the oven. My sincere apologies for the delays, I fully understand how annoying it can be to look forward to something only to have the rug pulled. That’s why we won’t be announcing any more specific dates until it’s a 100% lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12560066721728918028gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12560066721728918028gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's no specific date being given now but it will be in the "near future", so I imagine still this year.</p>
<p>Good news though — you can play the demo right now on Steam for Steam Next Fest. Although the demo only has a Windows version, I've checked and it works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>. If you don't know how to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton see my guide</a>.</p>
<p>With the demo the developer mentioned it's now close to the EA release with a solid foundation, but it needs a lot more polish to "bring the core game loop and progression system to where they need to be, and bugs are still a little too prevalent" so it's still a bit rough.</p>
<p>The addition of vehicles is great! At one point I was driving along taking a shortcut, where thought I could make it over this little pond. Clearly I wasn't paying enough attention, as I drove into a bunch of chickens who shortly after descended on the vehicle and blew it up. Those are some powerful chickens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1037845281728917090gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1037845281728917090gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13575548471728917092gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13575548471728917092gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've also been mauled by a bear, I chased someone into a road because I wanted their gun and a car nicely finished them off for me, gave blood for money, raided many trashcans and at one point caused a riot so big it levelled most of the initial starter city — woops.</p>
<p>Even with my short time in it so far, I've already done and seen some truly hilarious things. I really enjoyed the first game, and just wanted more of it in a bigger setting and it seems Streets of Rogue 2 may very well deliver on that.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Daily Dungeon gives you a fresh dungeon-puzzle every day inspired by Wordle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember when Wordle appeared and the world seemingly went mad for it? How about a dungeon-crawling puzzle game inspired by it? Daily Dungeon is for you.</p>
<p>Created by Vijay Pemmaraju, here's what they said in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vijay.io/post/3l672nt25gn2r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media post</a> I spotted recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i made a game called <a href="https://dailydungeon.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dailydungeon.net</a> a couple years ago. it's a daily puzzler inspired by wordle that you can play on any device with a browser. check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of it is simple and it gives you a fresh dungeon to run about in each day with keys to collect to open doors, puzzles to solve to gain artifacts and beat it in the quickest time possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11171399471728913838gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11171399471728913838gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The puzzles in it have a fun mixture from memory games, to rearranging letters to make a correct word and more. You might also find some secrets - maybe. Once you manage to finish a run you're then given a stats screen with the number of steps taken, the time, badges earned and an option to share the details of it like my quick run today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dailydungeon.net #944 👟 700 ⏱ 06:02 ✨✂️👠🧠</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a really slow time due to taking the screenshot and testing stuff. <em>Don't judge me on it.</em></p>
<p>I just thought it was a great idea and thought you might like it too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The best tool for video recording and livestreaming is about to get another upgrade with OBS Studio 31.0.0 Beta 1 out now.It's in Beta meaning it's not quite ready for everyone, but a good time to test everything works as expected ahead of the next stable release.</p>
<p>For this release NVIDIA Kepler GPUs are no longer supported for NVENC, NVIDIA users also need to upgrade at least to driver version 550.54.14.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added NVIDIA Blur Filter and Background Blur.</li>
<li>Added preview scrollbars and zoom/scale indicator.</li>

<p>Some Linux-specific changes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Changed display and window capture on Linux to not capture implicitly.</li>
<li>Improved screensaver inhibit functions on Linux in Flatpak</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Support for Ubuntu 22.04 was also removed, so you'll need to upgrade for it.</p>
<p>There's various other bug fixes and improvements like an NVENC upgrade. See the <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.0.0-beta1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p><em>Notice: This article originally went up last week, a bit too early, the Beta was properly released two days later so it has been republished today.</em></p>

      <title>Mini Royale is a battle royale with toy soldiers and fun game modes - demo available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're after a new shooter that will have Linux support, Mini Royale looks like it could end up being a good choice.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the world of Mini Royale, where the battlefield is a kid’s bedroom and the warriors are green army toy soldiers! This action-packed battle royale pits you against other players in epic combat as you fight to be the last soldier—or team—standing in a chaotic, larger-than-life environment."</p>
<p>Ahead of Steam Next Fest today, the developer has upgraded the demo to bring on a new game mode that sounds like a lot of fun. The mode is called "Color Conquest" where 4 teams of different colours battle to eliminate each other. The fun part: if you die, you join the killer's team. So at some point, someone will make their last stand against everyone else, and potentially do well enough to repopulate their own team.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qd4kGADVIFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ec68f087b53545973d2c2d9d9e09203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qd4kGADVIFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that, there's also a more standard battle royale mode for solos, duos and trios, plus support for custom games. Although of course the demo is limited on what you can do.</p>
<p>Some nice game mechanics in it with various different types of weapons you can customize with attachments, there's weapon levels (a bit like Fortnite) you can upgrade, interesting movement systems with a grapple gun and parachutes to zip across the map and more.</p>
<p>Visually it looks great, and the map design is a lot of fun too. So far in the demo I've managed a few games, and it does seem to perform really well with their Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657090/Mini_Royale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a> with the demo that will hopefully get populated during Steam Next Fest to try properly. I'm looking forward to properly diving in this evening.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the Stellaris 16 Gen 6, a more compact desktop-replacement laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After showing off the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-tuxedo-gemini-17-gen3-is-a-big-powerful-desktop-replacement-class-laptop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3</a> back in September, TUXEDO have now revealed a slightly more compact desktop-replacement laptop with the Stellaris 16.</p>
<p>What they said about it: "At first glance, the new TUXEDO Stellaris 16 - Gen6 may not appear exceptionally "compact" with its overall z-height of just over 2.6 cm and weight of 2.5 kg.</p>
<p>However, a second look with having the Linux high-end laptop's specifications in mind makes it clear: this is the fastest hardware on the planet in an enclosure that strikes the golden mean between portable case dimensions and high cooling capacity for either fastest high-end hardware on par with upper-class desktop PCs or quieter fan noise at very high working and gaming performance."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8686940631728902627gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Moving past the marketing speak for a moment, what are you getting? Full Linux support of course, as standard for TUXEDO systems. The base config on offer comes in at €1660 (excluding tax) and that will give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display: 16'' WQXGA IPS | 16:10 | 240 Hz (2560 x 1600), 100% sRGB, G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Processor: Intel Core i9-14900HX.</li>
<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090)</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB DDR5-5600.</li>
<li>Storage: 500GB Samsung 980 SSD.</li>
<li>Wireless: Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 (802.11ax | 2.4, 5 &amp; 6 GHz | Bluetooth 5.3)</li>
<li>Power: 99 Wh battery.</li>
<li>For ports you're getting in total: 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen1, USB-C 3.2 Gen1, 2-in-1 audio jack (headphone &amp; microphone), Card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC), HDMI 2.1, Gigabit ethernet, DC-in, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while it is indeed pricey, that's a ridiculous amount of power in a still pretty small case overall. You could do some serious gaming on that.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Stellaris-16-Gen6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their website</a>. They said the shipping starts mid-November.</p>
<p>I'm curious to know if there's any TUXEDO computers customers reading GamingOnLinux, be sure to give over your experiences in the comments. </p>

      <title>Slimbook reveal the new powerful AMD powered EVO ultrabook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slimbook have announced a fresh powerful AMD Ryzen powered ultrabook, the EVO, and it looks like a wonderful device. If you're after a new laptop from a company with top Linux support, this should be on your radar.</p>
<p>Coming in a €999 with the €100 discount for pre-orders, it's due to arrive in December. So what do you get for that price? Quite a lot actually and they expect it to end up as the "best-selling computer in our history".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9684717121728900571gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Main specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS 8 cores 16 threads, up to 5.1GHz.</li>
<li>Graphics: AMD Radeon 780M.</li>
<li>Display: 14” WQXGA 3K (2880x1800) 16:10 sRGB 100% sRGB refresh 125 Hz 400 nits.</li>
<li>Ports: 2x USB-C 3.2 Gen2 + DP 1.4 + PD 100W.</li>
<li>Ports: 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen2 + 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen1.</li>
<li>Keyboard: backlit.</li>
<li>Material: aluminum.</li>
<li>Connectivity: Wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2.</li>
<li>RAM memory: up to 96GB at 5600 MHz DDR5 (16GB DDR5 on base model).</li>
<li>Disks: 2x SSD NVMe PCIe 4.0 M.2 up to 8TB (500GB NVMe on base model).</li>
</ul>
<p>This unit is a replacement for their previous flagship model, the ProX, and it comes with many other improvements. Fans of security and privacy will be pleased to know it has a physical webcam lock, there's now a Gigbit ethernet port, a SD / SDHC / SDXC card reader, Nahimic 2412 speakers they say "provide less muffled sound and less distortion during over-amplification compared to their predecessors" and dual high-performance fans that are "designed for gaming laptops but optimized for quiet operation in a slim profile".</p>
<p>You can order it with your choice of Linux including Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, KDE neon, Debian, Linux Mint, Fedora, Manjaro and more. Windows is also an option but bumps up the price by at least €170.</p>
<p>Overall it really does sound great.</p>

      <title>Minetest breaks the chains of being a Minecraft clone with a new name — Luanti</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minetest, a voxel game engine created to be something like a Minecraft clone, is finally smashing apart the chains to become more its own unique thing.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the team explained why it was originally created and how it's grown with a huge community. Minetest itself of course, is just a voxel game engine, a platform for various games. And so with that in mind, it needed its own identity to finally throw off the "Minecraft clone" comments and so the era of Minetest is now over with the introduction of <strong>Luanti</strong>.</p>
<p>The name is a play on the Finnish word luonti (“creation”) and the programming language used for games and mods, Lua. Combined together, that's Luanti. They're still in the process of getting all bits of it renamed, so it may take a while.</p>
<p>Seems quite a fitting name and I like the idea behind it, although it's not particularly memorable, but then again for most people it will be the <em>games</em> made with it that create the memories. If you missed it we also had MineClone2, a game for <s>Minetest</s> <em>Luanti</em>, recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/mineclone2-inspired-by-minecraft-gets-renamed-to-voxelibre/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">change its name to VoxeLibre</a> as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7592450361728899419gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7592450361728899419gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Open source Theme Hospital engine &#39;CorsixTH&#39; v0.68.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Theme Hospital originally from Bullfrog Productions is a true classic, one I spent a ridiculous amount of time playing and the CorsixTH project is doing fantastic work to keep it alive for modern platforms. A new release of this open source reimplementation has been released with version 0.68.0 now available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6948188941728896112gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - CorsixTH 0.68.0 on Linux</em></p>

<li>Custom campaign creators can now optionally use the original level advance movie when progressing through the campaign.</li>
<li>The Map Editor has received some love including new features, fixes, and jukebox controls.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<em>Pictured - CorsixTH 0.68.0 on Linux</em></p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The demo movie will no longer play and cause jumpscares at the main menu if the CorsixTH window is not in focus.</li>
<li>Game speeds are now more closely aligned with the original game.</li>
<li>Improvements to handling of win/lose conditions, and the progress report.</li>
<li>Staff tiredness levels are now taken from the level config file based on difficulty level of the main campaign.</li>
<li>You can no longer win a level if you still have outstanding loans.</li>
<li>Emergencies will now be announced once patients actually begin arriving instead of at the start.</li>
<li>Errors with music playback will now attempt to provide more helpful information in the console.</li>
<li>Level briefings now show before the in-game tutorial</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You need the data files from the original game which you can buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/theme_hospital?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux you can grab the CorsixTH engine from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.corsixth.corsixth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it working was ridiculously easy too. I installed the classic from GOG using the Heroic Launcher, pointed CorsixTH to the folder and it just worked. Nice. </p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.18 Beta released, still not quite the true end of the line</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When will it end? Will SteamOS 3.6 ever become stable? The end of the line has come, and gone, a few times now.</p>
<p>You thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.16</a> "End of the Line" was going to be it? Wrong. You also thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-3617-beta-released-with-another-quick-fix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.17</a> "End of the End of the Line" would be the one — also quite clearly wrong. Now we're onto <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4511009460896477896" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.18 Beta</a> "The Color at the End of the End of the Line".</p>
<p>Could this actually be the one to push SteamOS 3.6 over the finishing line into a stable release? Only the code magicians at Valve will know the answer to that.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This update is for the Steam Deck Beta and Preview channels, and includes new features that are still being tested. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a possible crash when using Steam Deck as the Remote Play host</li>
<li>Fixed colorspace for Game Recording</li>
<li>Improved color range when using Remote Play to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam purchases now clearly state you&#39;re just getting a license not ownership</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing the rounds across the net right now is a small update to the Steam checkout process when you're making a purchase, to make it clear you don't own what you buy.</p>
<p>Valve added a note (I don't entirely know when), to mention how "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam" with a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement. As you can see in my shot below taken today when testing a purchase:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9233828001728818534gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9233828001728818534gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Of course, there's already a lot of misinformation going around about this from people on social media. To remind everyone: this has <em>always</em> been the case. The Steam Subscriber Agreement says (if you bothered to read it, you all read agreements right?) "The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services".</p>
<p>So while this has always been the case, it is still somewhat buried because most people just quickly scroll through these things to get access to what they want. At least now, Valve has put it upfront every time you make a license purchase on Steam.</p>
<p>Why is all this happening now? You can likely thank a new California law on this (<a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AB 2426</a>) that is summarised as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Existing law makes it unlawful for any person doing business in California and advertising to consumers in California to make any false or misleading advertising claim. Existing law makes a person who violates specified false advertising provisions liable for a civil penalty, as specified, and provides that a person who violates those false advertising provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>This bill would, subject to specified exceptions, additionally prohibit a seller of a digital good from advertising or offering for sale a digital good, as defined, to a purchaser with the terms buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental, unless the seller receives at the time of each transaction an affirmative acknowledgment from the purchaser, or the seller provides to the consumer before executing each transaction a clear and conspicuous statement, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GOG took the opportunity to jump into this as well on Twitter / X with a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> suggesting they will be adding a note onto their checkout process too, to say that their offline installers they offer cannot be taken away from you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8988360621728818791gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8988360621728818791gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new law <em>doesn't</em> seem to actually affect GOG, since in the main bill text it does specifically note it does not apply if they have access to a permanent offline download. However, it should be noted GOG also sell you a <em>license</em> as per their own terms. So while the new bill may not apply to them, this little jibe only really properly works <em>if</em> people are backing up all of their GOG purchases. Since you only get a license, rights holders <em>could</em> still technically get GOG to entirely remove them.</p>
<p>I should also note that this situation is the same for most physical media too, it's not a digital distribution only issue for consumers. Much like GOG's offline installers, you have access to your physical media whenever you want, but you still only get a license for the media you have on disc - you do <em>not</em> own it.</p>
<p><em>Over to you in the comments, what are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers gets booted from Steam Deck plugin store Decky Loader</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a bit of unfortunate drama going on right now in Steam Deck land, with the Steam Deck plugin NonSteamLaunchers for Decky Loader getting the boot. Both projects I've covered a fair bit (see plenty in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Deck tag</a>), and they're quite popular, so this is a bit of a PSA on what's happened.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of or not used the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a> project: it's a way to pretty darn easily install the likes of Amazon Games, GOG Galaxy, Epic Games and various other launchers with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. It can be used standalone on desktop, or as a <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> plugin.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Roy, the developer of NonSteamLaunchers reached out directly to notify me that NonSteamLaunchers was delisted from the Decky Loader plugin store. Something that will end up causing issues for users of it.</p>
<p>Trying to find out what happened is a bit difficult, since the situation really isn't very clear. Speaking to the Steam Deck Homebrew team behind Decky Loader, they provided me this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck Homebrew has decided to remove the NonSteamLaunchers plugin from the Decky Plugin Store after being shown statements on Steam Deck-related subreddits from its creator in a report. These appear to show continued harassment of members of these communities. We have also discovered harassment from the creator in our own server. We decided to delist the plugin from our store alongside banning its creator to prevent potential abuse of our community and plugin store.</p>
<p>Decky plugins can be downloaded outside the Decky Plugin Store, but we have decided to separate ourselves from NonSteamLaunchers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to Roy as well, they offered this statement of their own to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't believe I said anything racist or wrong to anyone regarding race or color or bigotry of any type or orientation of any kind. I will continue holding this stance and will not move from it. I still don't really know what I did wrong for my plug-in to be taken away so fast but I just want to apologize to the steam deck community for causing any sort of drama and for failing them as a developer. Unfortunately I don't know what has transpired but I am obviously not wanted in their environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully a resolution will be found for the benefit of the Steam Deck community for these popular tools. For now, NonSteamLaunchers fans will need to grab the tool directly.</p>

      <title>Comedy 2.5D puzzle-platformer Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator gets a demo and new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A single-player comedy adventure 2.5D platformer developer by a former Disney ride designer, Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator looks and sounds great.</p>
<p>Coming from Adventure Works, a small production studio lead by Jeffrey Ashbrook, a former Disney parks designer and a producer on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. What we've seen of it looks incredibly promising and I'm personally looking forward to seeing more from this one. The game will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>They just released a brand new demo ahead of Steam Next Fest, and to go along with it there's new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mh6Fo0WNths"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/baa002950d9e6e34d20011a75560d24f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mh6Fo0WNths" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the origins of the game, Jeffrey Ashbrook, founder at Adventure Works, said "I always wanted to create a game inspired by those cinematic story-driven adventures I loved growing up. I was such a big fan of ‘80s adventure films like Indiana Jones and The Goonies, and large-scale games like the Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid series, those seamless blends of cinematics and gameplay to create a memorable experience for players. Even with only a handful of devs from around the world , we wanted Ari to be that same kind of experience you used to get from much larger teams: full 3D cutscenes, ensemble casts of characters, and a story that you could really sink into if you wanted, so we’ve set our sights high and really hope people enjoy what we’ve been creating."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thrilling cinematic adventure:</strong> Embark on a rip-roaring, feel-good journey inspired by classic blockbuster adventure films.</li>
<li><strong>Eccentric ensemble cast:</strong> Interact with an eccentric and loveable cast including 11 fully voice-acted characters.</li>
<li><strong>Nostalgic puzzle platforming</strong><strong>: </strong>Journey through 13 levels and 6 distinct environments - from freezing tundras to scorching deserts.</li>
<li><strong>Stunning in-game cutscenes:</strong> Feast your eyes on stunning in-game cinematics from the mind of a former Disney producer.</li>
<li><strong>Unique tools and abilities:</strong> Unlock a repertoire of quirky tools to solve mysteries, utilize environmental elements, and tackle treacherous terrain.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184020/Ari_Buktu_and_the_Anytime_Elevator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam now</a>. There's no set date for the release yet but the demo is live now.</p>

      <title>ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius releases November 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios, developer of the popular Warhammer 40,000: Gladius, have announced their next 4x strategy game ZEPHON will release on November 8th. ZEPHON will have Native Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer sent me a pre-release key.</em></p>
<p>If you think it looks like Gladius, you would be right, since both are evolutions over Proxy Studios first game Pandora: First Contact from 2013. Here you control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>Check out their previous gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPD4MiGc2g0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc1ac8fea864939ac2780eeb0ece3d63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPD4MiGc2g0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. Zephon now has in excess of 500 k views on YouTube (including 100 k on the IGN gameplay trailer) and more than 100 k wishlists on Steam a month before release.</p>
<p>In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>You can wishlist and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Aspyr announce Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles coming to PC in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is another remaster coming from Aspyr Media, bringing over the originally console-exclusive game to PC. <em>The force appears to be strong with Aspyr.</em></p>
<p>Originally released back in the year 2000 for PlayStation, it was then released for Dreamcast and later the Game Boy Advance. Hopefully this latest Star Wars game from Aspyr will have a good release, after the mess that was the STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection but since then they seem to be doing really well with their other releases getting great reviews. I'm just happy to see more classics come to PC, so we can then play on Linux and Steam Deck thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Internet Archive hit with DDoS attacks and hacked with 31 million accounts hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sad day for the internet, as it has been confirmed that the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) that hosts a massive amount of historical data has been hit by DDoS attacks, and unfortunately they've had a breach.</p>
<p>Recently instead of seeing the website as usual, users were greeted with message like this (<a href="https://x.com/jwdomb/status/1844123760720548040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">credit</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5468299481728640690gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIBP is in reference to the popular <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPwned</a> website, that lists various data breaches and now <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#InternetArchive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">includes</a> this latest breach in their database. Troy Hunt, founder of HIBP, <a href="https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1844136762727448644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a thread on Twitter / X that it is legitimate and they had been communicating with the Internet Archive about it,</p>
<p>The breach was also <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, who said this on Twitter / X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we know: DDOS attack–fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords.</p>
<p>What we’ve done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security.</p>
<p>Will share more as we know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did briefly come back up, but was hit by another DDoS. As a result, the Internet Archive has been taken offline while their admins deal with the situation.</p>
<p>An account on Twitter / X called "Sn_darkmeta" claimed responsibility for it.</p>
<p><em>Just another reminder that you should never share passwords between websites.</em></p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.10, Kubuntu 24.10 and other Linux flavours now officially released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is here. Canonical have announced the release of Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole), along with various flavours like Kubuntu 24.10 now being available. <em>This is not an LTS (long term support) release, but an interim release towards the next LTS.</em></p>
<p>Some of the big changes include the latest 6.11 kernel, along with Canonical's shift to "a more aggressive kernel version selection policy going forward", automatic kernel crash dumps, GNOME 47 with its various new additions to the desktop and also Wayland by default for NVIDIA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376433451728639494gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376433451728639494gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole)</em></p>
<p>You'll also find various Raspberry Pi support improvements, various improvements to the Snap packages like the new security center, additional stability and performance patches added to GNOME, Firefox 130, LibreOffice 24.8, Thunderbird 128, Pipewire 1.2.4 and the list of updates goes on and on.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-oracular-oriole-released/48652/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Gaming on Linux with Apple Silicon now becoming a very real thing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has given an update in a blog post and a presentation at XDC 2024 going over work to improve Linux gaming on the Apple M1/M2 with Asahi Linux.</p>
<p>They announced their "Asahi game playing toolkit" which brings together their Vulkan 1.3 graphics driver, and x86 emulation with Windows game compatibility (using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> amongst other things). It's all still "Alpha" level quality, but good enough to run some AAA games now. Unlike Apple's own macOS, Asahi Linux has the <em>only</em> conformant OpenGL®, OpenCL™, and Vulkan® drivers for this hardware (as Apple focus on their own API - Metal).</p>
<p>All you have to do is install the Fedora Asahi Remix on your Apple system, get the latest driver updates and then install Steam although they said "most games require 16GB of memory due to emulation overhead".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fallout 4 on Apple Hardware with Fedora Asahi Remix</em></p>
<p>Incredible work to make more hardware not only able to run Linux nicely, but become actual proper gaming machines too. Sounds like it's been a thoroughly complicated process, with many contributors but the end result looks great for users.</p>
<p>More work is to be done yet on the Honeykrisp driver, like "Sparse texturing" up next which they said will "unlock more DX12 games" but it's already good enough for titles like Fallout 4, Hollow Knight and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>More in their <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and you can see their talk during XDC 2024 - Day 2 in the below video with the talk starting at about 20:46 (they do eventually start speaking English):</p>

      <title>First Steam Deck plugin on Steam will bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em><strong>Update: It looks like Valve have changed their position on this. See this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/that-didnt-last-long-the-junk-store-for-steam-deck-has-its-steam-page-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated article</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Original Article:</p>
<p>In a really surprising move the developers behind Decky Loader plugin <em>Junk Store</em>, which provides the ability to install games from GOG and Epic Games, are bringing the plugin to Steam officially.</p>
<p>This is a special new release just for the Steam Deck, and <em>seems</em> to indicate that Valve are open to having Steam Deck plugins available directly like this. Especially nice for all the people claiming free games (or buying) from the Epic Games Store and GOG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will <em>not</em> be free and open source like the Decky Loader plugin though, as confirmed in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g0qygm/junk_store_is_officially_coming_to_the_steam_store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, due to the work involved in re-writing it for a Steam release. A price has not been decided on it yet as they gauge interest. However, the existing plugin will remain. The developers said they plan to keep expanding it and hopefully add support for more stores too.</p>
<p>That is, <strong>if</strong> Valve <em>do</em> actually give it the true nod of approval once the Junk Store developers are ready to put it live. Valve has at least approved the Steam store page, so it it has at least passed the initial stage but it could still end up catching more attention and end up not being approved - this will be quite a test for Valve too. Just how open is Steam really on what it will allow?</p>
<p>Main features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engineered specifically for Game Mode. Once installed you can download and launch games without needing to go into Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Junk Store utilises the Steam-native interface for managing games, allowing Steam to handle most of the process.</li>
<li>Junk Store leverages Steam's built-in functionality to manage Proton prefixes.</li>
<li>You can use the QAM to adjust per game Proton settings such as FPS limiting, etc.</li>
<li>It is extensible! You can write whatever you want for Junk Store integrations if you have the skill. You don't need to wait on anyone else to add features or store front integrations.</li>
<li>Currently we have integrated support for Epic and Gog Games that ships with Junk Store.</li>
<li>Epic achievements and EOS overlay are functional for games that support this feature (however, there is no playtime tracking).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Compatibility with other stores is a common complaint with the Steam Deck. You are able to go into Desktop Mode and install whatever you want, but the convenience of having something directly on Steam will be nice.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3250950/Junk_Store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck officially comes to Australia in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Our friends down under will finally be able to buy an officially supported Steam Deck, as it heads to Australia officially in November. It's been a long road to get there, but it's finally happening which opens up Australia to other Valve hardware now too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck LCD was originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released back in February 2022</a> and was later expanded with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/steam-deck-hits-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-and-taiwan-on-december-17th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Komodo partnership</a> to also be sold in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Much <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">later in November 2023</a>, Valve then revealed the much better Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press email the prices will be (inclusive of GST):</p>
<ul>
<li>256GB LCD: $649.00 AUD</li>
<li>512GB OLED: $899.00 AUD</li>
<li>1TB OLED: $1049.00 AUD</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad pricing, and with the OLED truly being a much better device you really should grab that model if you can afford it. It's truly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the definitive Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>It's only going to get better too with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming release of SteamOS 3.6</a>.</p>
<p>Once Valve are eventually ready to talk more about a potential Steam Deck 2, this should also hopefully mean Australia won't be left out in the cold on release day. Although, it's also another signal that the current Steam Deck model is here to stay for some time yet.</p>
<p>You can follow along for more using our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Tag</a> (with a dedicated RSS feed), our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Forum Category</a> and the Steam Deck Channel in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</p>

      <title>Think you&#39;ve seen it all? There&#39;s now a Steam game about squeezing eggs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've cooked a lot of them in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/arctic-eggs-is-thoroughly-weird-physics-based-dystopian-cooking-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arctic Eggs</a> (which is really good) but have you ever just stopped for a moment to squeeze some eggs? No? Maybe you should. Released on Steam on October 1st it's now <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified and works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> perfectly on Kubuntu Linux desktop.</p>
<p>So what is it? Egg Squeeze is a "biological intuition test where you squeeze eggs for as long as you can without breaking them". No, I have no idea what's going on here either. I had to test it of course, for science, and to see if I could beat the test. Or maybe the test will beat me, or whisk me, or fry me — or whatever else you do with eggs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While you're squeezing that egg tightly, trying not to smash it inside your palm, some funky music starts playing. The longer you manage to hold down the button to squeeze before it cracks, the better your score. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell when it's about to break and it's scrambled my brain. I'm not entirely sure what exactly it is that I'm doing. It's all about testing your synergy with the eggs apparently, but how does that work? I need an answer.</p>
<p>Get multiple in a row that you managed to keep intact, and you'll build up streak, crack it open and you'll lose points. The more I played, the more confused I became, and thoroughly frustrated at the amount of eggs I had smashed open. I've touched and smooshed more eggs in this game that I have in my entire real life.</p>
<p>When you manage to hit the needed score, it's time to start a new day and…things get weird — really weird. Seems the days get progressively more difficult too, with the second day adding in an insanity bar and if you crack too many eggs it's game over, and the score you need to hit is much higher too.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lx7M7H_2iWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9b31be0b1adc8c8a06d524b7ba2da44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lx7M7H_2iWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Surprisingly tense for such a simple game too. When you're one crushed egg away from losing and you're counting in your head to a specific number and then (much like the egg) your dreams about passing the test get demolished as you let out a loud expletive <em>F—</em> with a sigh.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been chosen as a volunteer for the "Egg Squeeze" exam - a test that evaluates one's <em>psychokinetic intuition of biological makeup</em>. In each test, you will be asked to squeeze an egg for a short period of time. The objective is to estimate the egg's unique breaking point and release your grasp <strong>Before it cracks</strong>. You will be graded relative to your synergy with the eggs.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>May the eggs be ever in your favor.</strong></p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Short core game (1-3 hours)</li>
<li>"Infinite Squeeze" mode, for unlimited replayability</li>
<li>50+ track score, composed by indie game veterans</li>
<li>Plenty of secrets waiting to be found...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229170/Egg_Squeeze/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Explore a top-secret uranium mine in retro-FPS Kvark</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kvark is a new release from developer Latest Past and publisher Perun Creative, set in a fictional version of the 80s Czech Republic where you explore a top-secret uranium mine. <em>Note: my key was provided by PR Outreach.</em></p>
<p>The 1.0 release is out now, which comes with a Native Linux version after a year in Early Access. What is it? A retro-inspired FPS that pays homage to such games as Half-Life and BioShock. You can definitely tell, as it wears the inspiration on its sleeve. If you love retro inspired shooters, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBmUjnIvO4I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9627d46639b4f5bff8839207fd19ecb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBmUjnIvO4I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced fights with a plethora of weapons, from wrenches to grenades, bazookas, and the iconic EK-48.</li>
<li>Uniquely designed, diverse, and challenging enemies that require swift tactics and weapon swapping, quick thinking, and constant movement.</li>
<li>An intriguing story told through hidden notepads that the player must find to reveal.</li>
<li>Search for suspicious substances that may help you with your efforts.</li>
<li>Simple to intricate puzzles that the player will have to solve to progress.</li>
<li>Detailed, interactive levels that reward players willing to explore with hidden Easter eggs, secrets, and achievements.</li>
<li>Stylized retro graphics that bring old-school gaming nostalgia.</li>
<li>A strong “just-one-more-level” vibe and loads of explosive fun!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Native Linux version that was tested, two prominent bugs were found in the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos don't play and instead you get a white screen (the developer is aware).</li>
<li>In my case when pressing ESC to go to the menu, I was unable to exit the menu again unless I loaded the last save. That's quite game-breaking as you'll lose progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on those issues, I would recommend just playing it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> where those issues don't exist after testing with Proton 9.0-3. However, with Proton the Unreal Engine it uses brings up an additional step to install some bits it needs so you'll have to wait a minute or two for it to appear.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319390/Kvark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) is a sweet game about writing letters to real people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Expanding greatly from the original, Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) from Popcannibal is out now with Linux support. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, all you need are a few kind words to set your day off right or to cheer you up from a bad week. That's pretty much what Kind Words 2 is all about. You write and receive completely anonymous letters, all real people that are also playing it. The sequel is a far bit more than that though with you able to go out and explore a little, giving you more opportunities for letter writing. It includes everything from the original game (the letters are backwards compatible), remastered and available inside this one too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-Qzjz4wVfR0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc8bbb9067d2fa00b14585a919f25148.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-Qzjz4wVfR0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In this one there's also shops you can visit to change your look, write and share poems or listen to others, visit the forest to write chain-letters and more. It's just thoroughly sweet.</p>
<p>Calling it a game is perhaps doing it dirty, it's not a game in the sense that you <em>play</em> it, it acts more like an anonymous social network with a specific laser-focus of just being nice to everyone and getting some advice, or getting some handy tips and suggestions.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118120/Kind_Words_2_lofi_city_pop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>FEX-Emu version 2410 out bringing some important fixes for gaming on AArch64</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://fex-emu.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu</a> is an emulation layer that allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries (like games and apps) on an AArch64 Linux host, similar to qemu-user and box86/box64. Instead of using full disk images, FEX-Emu uses rootfs overlay + forwarding GL processing to the host to achieve better performance in emulated software.</p>
<p>Version 2410 was <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2410/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released this week</a> and the changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARM64EC changes:</strong> Fixed AVX bugs around state saving and restoring when running under Wine, and changes to dynamically determine Windows syscall numbers under WINE instead of hardcoding them. The call checker was also revamped fixing issues when applications hook function early using Wind32 APIs.</li>
<li><strong>JIT Optimizations</strong>: More optimized JIT code which result in 9% less CPU being spent in JIT'ing code. This is important because, the less time cpu is spent in JIT the less "choppy" the software being emulated will be.</li>
<li><strong>JIT fixes: </strong>Fixed bugs on the x87 instruction set that was offering a bugged <code class="inline-code">FPREM</code> instruction (although <code class="inline-code">FPREM1</code> was working and its also part of <code class="inline-code">x87</code>). One of the weird issues this caused was that Steam login was super weird and you had to repeat login multiple times to work. This also fixed bugs on <em>Touhou Luna Nights</em> and <em>Halls of Torment</em> games. <code class="inline-code">SSE MAXSS</code> instruction was also fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed changelog of changes can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/compare/FEX-2409...FEX-2410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed it there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been some leaks</a> that Valve may be preparing to use tools like FEX to get gaming working on ARM. So it's a project worth following to see the progress.</p>

      <title>Descent 3: Piccu Engine is a new open source build focused on quality-of-life improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to Descent 3 being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/descent-3-has-been-made-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">officially open source</a>, developers can do almost anything with it now and this has given rise to the <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/PiccuEngine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Descent 3: Piccu Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Forked from the open source Descent 3 game engine the Descent 3: Piccu Engine, it includes "almost every change from <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/InjectD3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InjectD3</a>, among many more". You might think, well why not submit to the original open source project? But this is the benefit of open source isn't it! People can do whatever changes they want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1397537761728463053gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Descent 3 from Steam</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This includes enhancements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Centered window mode.</li>
<li>Scaling in window and fullscreen mode.</li>
<li>Fullscreen which does not change desktop settings (multi adapter support forthcoming).</li>
<li>New mouse code.</li>
<li>Adjustable FOV, with automatic expansion for widescreen.</li>
<li>Missing features in OpenGL restored, including specular highlights and the ability to control mipmapping.</li>
<li>Cockpit actually works in widescreen, unlike InjectD3.</li>
<li>Faster iteration when many missions are present.</li>
<li>Smoother UI (FPS limit raised to 60).</li>
<li>OpenAL sound system with no crackling and environment reverb support.</li>
<li>Many bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently though according to the GitHub page this version of the code is only set up for Windows, but the developer hopes "to change this shortly".</p>
<p>You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed in the inbox of no return from last week. The next-generation SDL 3 is closing in on a proper stable release now with the SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview now available for game developers.</p>
<p>Despite the version number, it's still pre-release and not officially released just yet. What is SDL used for? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware on many different platforms like Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>In the release <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> developer Sam Lantinga (Valve) said: "We have lots of bugs to fix before the 3.2.0 stable release, but SDL 3.0 has been battle tested by millions of people in DOTA, CS2 and Steam, and is ready for your eyes!". Additionally developer Ryan Gordon <a href="https://x.com/icculus/status/1842311794817442015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Twitter / X: "I can't believe I finally get to say this. SDL3 is officially ABI locked! We will _add_ new things but not _change_ or _remove_ what's there, starting right now. Which means it's safe to start migrating your games to it, starting today!"</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/main/examples" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Example programs</a> to get you started, <a href="https://examples.libsdl.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">running in your web browser</a>!</li>
<li>More consistent API naming conventions. Everything is named consistently across the API now, instead of different subsystems taking different approaches. Also, we've tended toward more descriptive names for things in SDL3.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GPU API</a>: access to modern 3D rendering and GPU compute in a cross-platform way.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryDialog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dialog API</a>: access to system file dialogs (file and folder selection UI for opening/saving).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryFilesystem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Filesystem API</a>: simple directory management and globbing, access to topic-specific user folders.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryStorage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Storage API</a>: Abstract interface to platform-specific storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryCamera" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Camera API</a>: access to webcams.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryPen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pen API</a>: access to pens (like Wacom tablets and Apple Pencil, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_OpenAudioDevice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logical audio devices</a>: different parts of an app can get their own unique audio device to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Properties API</a>: fast, flexible dictionaries of name/value pairs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProcess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Process API</a>: Spawn child processes and communicate with them in various ways.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_Colorspace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Colorspace support</a>: Surfaces and the renderer, etc, can manage multiple colorspaces.</li>
<li>The Clipboard API <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetClipboardData" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can support any data type</a> (SDL2 only handled text), and apps can provide data in multiple formats upon request in <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_ClipboardDataCallback" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a provided callback</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/BestKeyboardPractices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Better keyboard input</a>, for all your keypress needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_StartTextInputWithProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Customizable virtual keyboards</a> on iOS and Android.</li>
<li>High DPI support is dramatically improved over SDL2.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetAppMetadata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">App metadata API</a> for letting SDL report things about your app correctly (like in the About dialog on macOS, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateRWLock" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read/write thread locks</a>, to let multiple threads access rarely-changing data in parallel.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_InitState" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Init State</a> to help with multiple threads that might need to initialize something on-demand without racing.</li>

      <title>Block Factory is basically a LEGO factory automation game with diorama building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen and likely played Factorio, Satisfactory and no doubt seen the chilled-out shapez 2 but there's a newcomer ready to suck your time away in Block Factory. This one is basically a LEGO block factory and automation sim, they just obviously can't use the LEGO name.</p>
<p><em>I've been played the demo on Kubuntu Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9</a> and it works beautifully.</em></p>
<p>Coming from OverPowered Team and publisher Shiro Unlimited there's a few things that will set this one apart from the likes of shapez 2, which is what it's most similar to for the much more relaxed atmosphere — just you and the factory and your many conveyor belts.</p>
<p>Here, not only are you extracting blocks but you also need to put them together <em>manually</em> in a little mini-building game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To make it clearer: you will set down piece dispensers to pull up blocks from resource nodes, and send them across the map on conveyors into various stacking machines. It's inside here, that you manually drag blocks around to arrange them. It can get complicated, since you will end up needing to do this across multiple stackers to end up with the exact shape needed at the end. So you'll stack certain blocks together, to then stack multiple of those together later into another shape.</p>
<p>Quite a brilliantly clever use of game mechanics here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then you have more like gluing blocks together on their sides, you may also need to cut certain blocks into different shapes to then combine or stick together later on. There's a <em>lot</em> of possibilities here, and based on the demo they're really doing some great stuff with the ideas.</p>
<p>Eventually on each map you build up a diorama too, so it gives you a fun little something to progress towards.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A6yGmc7HOsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e26522d317ff624d4c543203b1d418f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A6yGmc7HOsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think this one, if done right with enough content in the full game, it will end up being a big hit. Really enjoyed trying out the demo.</p>
<p>Worth a go check it out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827680/Block_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare come to PC on October 29</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally huh? They sure kept us waiting. Red Dead Redemption from Rockstar Games is now set for a PC launch on October 29.</p>
<p>Working together with Double Eleven the PC release will come enhanced with native 4K resolution at up to 144hz on compatible hardware, monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9), HDR10 support, and full keyboard and mouse functionality. It will also feature NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings and more.</p>
<p>It will also include Undead Nightmare plus bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mnvc6uC6xZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c573668e74e3ca508b2d327f8b7e90d3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mnvc6uC6xZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One still annoying thing about this release is that according to the Steam page it "Requires 3rd-Party Account: Rockstar Games". For a single-player game that's always a nuisance since there's no multiplayer content in this release.</p>
<p>It will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available from Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be buying it? Hopefully it will run well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>ZOOM Platform store announces new tool to run Windows games on Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news here. <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a>, a games store that offers DRM-free games both new and old (as well as helping update some older games) now offers a special tool for Linux gamers to run Windows games with Proton.</p>
<p>This new tool called <a href="https://zoom-platform.sh/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">zoom-platform.sh</a> was built to include "safety checks, handling updates, installing DLCs, creating desktop entries, a simple uninstaller" and more. It's based on top of the new Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-umu-gets-a-first-official-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a first release</a>, along with protonfixes to ensure everything works as well as possible.</p>
<p>How many games from ZOOM Platform will work with this new tool? They said "We tested our most popular games, and we submitted our own fixes for many of them; some work out of the box, and some may not work at all." - so pretty normal stuff for running Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>ZOOM Platform do offer actual Native Linux games too, but this gives you the best of both worlds. They also recently celebrated their 10th anniversary of the ZOOM Platform.</p>

      <title>Pairs &amp; Perils combines deck-building and dungeon-crawling with a card-matching memory game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've probably played card-matching memory games before, but have you played them in the setting of a dungeon-crawling deck-builder before? Pairs &amp; Perils has a fun idea.</p>
<p>Here you have to try and memorize all the cards on the table to match up weapons and characters to attack enemies, while avoiding damaging trap cards that will force you to skip a turn. There's enemies to battle who have a turn countdown until they attack, so you have to defeat them with card matching before you die.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18641006571728389691gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18641006571728389691gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After each turn you earn coins to go into the shop where you're able to buy up new special cards in the form of relics to have an effect all the time, plus cards you can consume for special effects during a battle. Thanks to this system there's plenty of ways to go through a run.</p>
<p>Various enemies you face have special abilities too and some of them can be quite annoying to get in the way of you matching your cards, or even destroying your prized relic that's been helping you push through a run. Overall a nice little twist on the deck-building dungeon-crawler idea that I'm keen to see more from as the demo is promising.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WWT3NXXbzSE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/029b85eb4eb87b283fa31f0279d1d5cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WWT3NXXbzSE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179860/Pairs__Perils/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> now with a Native Linux version. I played through it for a while today and it works great.</p>

      <title>Space Marine 2 fixes online for Steam Deck but may need launch option on desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Marine 2 recently broke online play on Linux / Steam Deck, but the latest update should solve it. Although it seems desktop Linux users will need a launch option.</p>
<p>The breakage came from the 3.0 patch which caused a AVF error to appear and stopping Linux / Steam Deck players from accessing any of the online features.</p>
<p>In the latest "Hotfix 3.1" there's these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4696782040358852369" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fixes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed heavy stutters on some CPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed launch issue on Linux and Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with dynamic resolution and ultrawide screens.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with upscalers using wrong resolution parameters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13977292441728386997gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>However, like we've seen from a few games over the last year, desktop Linux users have issues since the game appears to look for the Steam Deck specifically. To get around it you need to spoof your desktop Linux PC to appear as a Steam Deck with this Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>

      <title>Gamescope gets improved ROG Ally support hinting at more progress for SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve previously confirmed</a> that they are indeed working towards a version of SteamOS (used on Steam Deck) for the ROG Ally / ROG Ally X, we're now seeing some of that get into <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>.</p>
<p>For those who don't know all the Linux lingo: Gamescope is micro-compositor, used by default on the Steam Deck (and can be used on desktop Linux) to manage the output of games in a way that's contained and then allow for many transformations on it like adjusting resolutions, FSR and NIS upscaling, fullscreen mode and more.</p>
<p>Just recently code was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/commit/b288a82a61005b91dd268b8ea4e8d124d4dd5267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merged</a> by a contributor (it's open source) into the project to allow for configuring the display on the ASUS ROG Ally and the newer ASUS ROG Ally X. From the notes on the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This introduces a display configuration for the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X handhelds. These devices feature the same 1920x1080p panel, which supports VRR and has a range limit of 48-120Hz in the EDID.</p>
<p>I tested this configuration on two separate units:<br/>
* ROG Ally - SteamOS Main 20240919.1002 with kernel 6.8.12-valve2-1<br/>
* ROG Ally X - SteamOS Main 20240919.1002 with kernel 6.11.2</p>
<p>Both function exactly the same throughout multiple games with the entire refresh rate slider within Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To set expectations: this doesn't mean a SteamOS build for the ROG Ally / X are due any time soon. It may still be a while away.</p>

<li>Lots of bug fixes and various other smaller updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The once a year request for donations pop-up is also live as of this release.</em></p>
<p>I'm still currently on Plasma 5.27, so I'm really looking forward to the next Kubuntu release with 24.10 that will at least get me up to Plasma 6.1. One of the benefits of being just a bit behind is seeing all the new stuff get stable before moving over to it. I'm excited! The KDE team have been doing some stellar work.</p>
<p>What are you most happy to see in Plasma 6.2? Leave a comment and let me know!</p>

      <title>Creative Assembly confirm Alien: Isolation is getting a sequel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's truly hard to believe that Alien: Isolation is 10 years old now, and we're going to get a sequel to one of the scariest games ever made.</p>
<p>Alien: Isolation is a special one for me, since Aliens is one of my all-time favourite movies, and this perfectly expanded the universe while treating it with respect. Just…my heart didn't particularly like it. What an exceptional experience it was to play.</p>
<p>The day after its 10th anniversary (today), the official account on X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> a sequel is now in early development. To save you clicking into Twitter here's the image-cropped statement they shared:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16804605381728316846gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16804605381728316846gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To our fans around the world:</p>
<p>It's hard to believe that it has been 10 years since we embarked on our journey with the release of ALIEN: ISOLATION™</p>
<p>When we started developing ALIEN: ISOLATION, we had one guiding principle: to create a truly authentic experience that went back to the roots of the ALIEN™ franchise - a new story capturing the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie masterpiece.</p>
<p>It's been nothing short of incredible to witness your passion for the game over the years and see it reach so many players around the world. Your boundless enthusiasm, excitement, screams (!) and steely courage in the face of cinema's greatest killer, have been profoundly rewarding.</p>
<p>Whether you're a nightmare mode veteran or stepping into Amanda Ripley's shoes for that thrilling first attempt (good luck!), we wanted to express our deep gratitude. It was a dream project brought to life by a brilliant team, and the reception you have given it over the years is extraordinary.</p>
<p>On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear.</p>
<p>Today, I'm delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to ALIEN: ISOLATION is in early development.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br/>
Al Hope, Creative Director - ALIEN: ISOLATION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original had Native Linux support from Feral Interactive, who no longer port games over to Linux, so it's likely you'll need Valve's Proton to play the sequel.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see what they come up with, and already terrified to think how it's going to feel to play through.</p>

      <title>Uncompromising wilderness survival game The Last Plague: Blight now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Original Studios just launched The Last Plague: Blight, an uncompromising wilderness survival game based on a more realistic set of game mechanics. It arrives with Native Linux support in Early Access. <em>Note: key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>For a game that's not finished, the initial impression I get from it is quite fantastic actually. Giving vibes of a mixture of Rust, Valheim and other similar games in a new and fresh setting that still somehow feels unique in a crowded genre.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YZXW5obTink"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a590df153c674dee3e32d22eac1a3b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YZXW5obTink" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One of the key points of this game is in the game, the dreaded Blight. It's a disease-ridden world, one where you will eventually try to find a cure. That's how the game sets you up too, you're not just randomly dropped into a world. You've escaped the Blight — for now, but you're on your own and you need to survive the wilderness with nothing but your bare hands to start with.</p>
<p>This is a game that, if you let it, will end up consuming you and your whole week. Everything in it takes time and it's surprisingly deep mechanically already. From smashing rocks together to make a bowl, to gathering and boiling water so it's safe and actually getting a roof over your head just surviving is a constant battle. Surprisingly a little bit on the scary side too, when you're wandering through the forest trying to reach water and a bunch of Coyotes run in the distance when all you've got a small hatched and a bowl to your name.</p>
<p>Thankfully there's a full tutorial to guide you through all the basics steps of getting stuff done, and even the tutorial will take you a good while to get through. The UI is also thankfully rather well thought-out too, all parts of it just seem to make sense to the point that I so far haven't been confused even a single time. Same can't be said for my sense of direction though, but that's also been thought about with you able to craft markers to help you. There's also a reasonable map system too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Even though there's plenty to it already the developer has big plans to keep expanding it including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Continuation of the story and tying in an actual long-term goal to the game.</li>
<li>Collaboration and trading with other NPC survivors to rebuild.</li>
<li>Fishing.</li>
<li>Character customization including gender.</li>
<li>Injury and wound system.</li>
<li>Controller support.</li>
<li>Taming animals.</li>
<li>More localized languages (French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, German, Italian and possibly more).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance is surprisingly great too. Testing it on my Kubuntu Linux desktop with an AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon RX 6800 XT on the Very High preset at 2560x1440 has been really smooth and always well above 60FPS.</p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access I'll be keeping a keen eye on this and keep checking back on it. If you're in need of a new game to get hooked on and get in deep this is a great choice right now. Great atmosphere, great game mechanics and really interesting to play. This has all the makings to be a huge hit and I'm already hooked on it.</p>
<p>Considering it's only £14.29 when not on sale, that's a fantastic price for what's there too - good value. It may go up in price once it leaves Early Access. There's also a demo available.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>Nazi Zombies: Portable is a free and open source Call of Duty: Zombies demake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this one before! A few developers have been building Nazi Zombies: Portable, a Call of Duty: Zombies demake powered by various enhanced forks of the Quake engine. What's a demake? It's basically remaking another game in an older style.</p>
<p>The developer explains: "The game itself is feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented with minor parity differences. Most World at War maps and their unique features are not yet represented. Various small additions and changes from Call of Duty: Black Ops are present as a means of gameplay smoothing, but not on a wide scale. NZ:P is, first and foremost, a Call of Duty: World at War remake."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1380712591728300172gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1380712591728300172gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nazi Zombies: Portable on Linux</em></p>
<p>If you've not played Call of Duty Zombies and have no idea what is going on: in simple terms it's a Zombie survival wave-shooter mode. You start off with a simple handgun, and gradually gain money from taking down the walkers to buy up new weapons and access new areas. I tried it out for a bit today and it feels pretty good actually, they really nailed the vibe of it and the mechanics.</p>
<p>Fun to see such a project exist. And perhaps with a little GamingOnLinux shout-out it can find a new audience, and who knows maybe some development help. Would love to see this one keep expanding.</p>

      <title>Ridiculous physics platformer Mosa Lina added co-op, game rebuilt to be native</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mosa Lina is a really fantastic game. It's also completely insanely ridiculous, full of chaos and now you can bring a friend along for the ride. It has Native Linux support and is <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? The developers say it's a "Hostile Interpretaion of immersive sim design". Basically, it's a challenging platformer with a whole lot of ridiculous physics going on. It's super random in the design, the developer explained how it's a "response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EbverJLQy_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb46c10d085434f1bf429bf1bc7b636.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EbverJLQy_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an update launched in September that I missed called The Collaboration Update they basically re-built the game so it's no longer using web browser tech to run the game, with it being fully native now. The benefit is that it runs much faster, it's smaller and many other improvements.</p>
<p>Also there's now full 2 player co-op in the game with local and online support. This co-op mode works with all existing modes and custom levels, plus there's two new co-op exclusive gameplay modifiers.</p>
<p>However, their recording system was removed, as they believe Steam Recording will be better. See all the improvements in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477090/view/4607834045442857504" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SKALD: Against the Black Priory is a retro-style party-based RPG set in a grim-dark fantasy world of tragic heroes, violent deaths and Lovecraftian horror. Released back in May, it now has full controller and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>More about it: "SKALD: Against the Black Priory is inspired by roleplaying games of yesteryear, combining modern design and compelling storytelling with authentic 8-bit looks and charms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21030865731728297809gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21030865731728297809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As of the latest update released September 30th it's been Steam Deck Verified, and the developers hooked up full controller support making it more accessible than ever. It also has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB so it's nicely playable with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Linux platforms.</p>

– The game now natively supports controller play on PC and Steam Deck.<br/>
– You may now use the mouse-wheel to scroll while mousing over menus and text fields.<br/>
– The game’s playability on Steam Deck has been vastly improved.<br/>
– You can now use the move-buttons / left joystick to deploy party members in the pre-combat party placement state (until now you’ve had to use the mouse).<br/>
– Pressing the “Swap Character” button (‘Q’ / RIGHT BUMPER) in combat, cycles through available targets.<br/>
– Character level cap is raised to 25.<br/>
– Certain enemies in the late game will now scale past level 20 making the end-game slightly more difficult.<br/>
– Added new Bard class. This includes a new school of spells..<br/>
– Added new Backgrounds: Entertainer, Laborer, Monastic, Nomad, Snake-Cultist.<br/>
– Fixed a bug where Horryn Guards roam around after you retake the city.</p>

      <title>Halo will now be built on Unreal Engine 5, 343 Industries rebrands to Halo Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of game industry news for you: in a pretty big win for Epic Games and their Unreal Engine, 343 Industries rebrands to Halo Studios and said the future of Halo will be built on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries. Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of how we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.” — Pierre Hintze, Studio Head</p>
<p>They confirmed that they're working on "multiple projects" so we can expect a whole lot more Halo to come. Hopefully they will work well enough on Linux platforms with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Part of this is building Project Foundry, which is a research project for the studio to see what's required to build a Halo game in Unreal Engine and makes it a training tool for them. You can see more from that in the video below.</p>

      <title>GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) finally closing on the 3.0 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For any of you who work with image editing on Linux for any reason, you've probably used the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) at some point, well it's getting really close to the long-awaited 3.0 release now. <em>It's a tool I use every day for GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Announced in a development <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/10/05/development-update/#non-destructive-editing-updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the team noted they're about 96% of the way there towards the first Release Candidate, after development slowed over the summer due to a few developers falling ill after the Libre Graphics Meeting conference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17021059391728293982gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17021059391728293982gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</em></p>
<p>Quite a lot to look forward to from this upcoming release including expanded non-destructive editing, upgrades to the API for plug-ins, work towards enabling letting you easily export an image into several different sizes leaving the original untouched, colour space work, darktable integration improvements for RAW images, upgrading the documentation, lots of bug fixes and so on.</p>

      <title>Grounded no longer needs a Microsoft Account for multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Sony are actively making their PC ports worse with forced PlayStation Network accounts even for single-player games, some companies choose to make them better and now Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios gets improved.</p>
<p>Grounded was updated at the end of September to remove the forced Microsoft Account sign-in to play multiplayer on PC, as it's now Steam Native. Nice to see! We saw a similar thing with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/it-takes-two-now-steam-deck-verified-ea-app-launcher-no-longer-required/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It Takes Two removing the EA app requirement</a>. Hope to see more like this, because it's thoroughly annoying to launch one game and end up with another sign-in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5922073391728292925gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/962130/view/4664130308822453256" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Native Support</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam players no longer require a Microsoft Account to play multiplayer
<ul>
<li>While not logged into a Microsoft Account, you can host and join standard world multiplayer sessions with players from your Steam friends list</li>
<li>Note: a Microsoft Account is still required for Crossplay, Shared Worlds and Playgrounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Crossplay Toggle in the Main Menu to quickly switch between a “Crossplay State” and a “Steam Native State”
<ul>
<li>Friends will need to be in the same “State” to see and join each other online</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players can now unlink their Microsoft Account from their Steam Account
<ul>
<li>Navigate by going to Options - Game Tab - At the bottom you will see “Unlink Microsoft Account”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Grounded is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

<p>If those interest you then <a href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/y2GbLb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Humble Bundle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Humble have this month <em>closed</em> their built-in partner program and moved over to the <em>much</em> less generous third-party service called Impact. So our links have changed, and we get <em>far</em> less now too. Remember that <a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a> is the best way to support GamingOnLinux (and now more than ever!).</p>
<p>Additionally, Humble seem to now be including Deck Verified status and info pulled from ProtonDB on the bundle. Although they're conflating ProtonDB status with how a game will run on Steam Deck, like for The Last Stand: Aftermath they say underneath it has "ProtonDB Platinum Deck Support" despite Valve listing it as Unsupported (since ProtonDB covers desktop Linux too). Nice to see they're trying though.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for SteamVR, Game Recording and Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Steam Client Beta release is live for October 4th that includes a bunch of quick bug fixes for desktop and Steam Deck. Since it's a normal Client (the Steam App) Beta update, it's the same for Steam Deck and desktop.</p>
<p>Here's all the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659627343423606990?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam not being able to connect to SteamVR with error "SteamVR Failed to initialize: VR API not loaded (101)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from October 2nd's beta client which was causing some recordings to incorrectly fall back to using the CPU to encode video while playing a game, resulting in an increase in CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing exporting a clip to file, clipboard or chat to fail or sometimes crash.</li>
<li>Fixes some cases where the clip export dialog did not appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from the October 2nd Beta Update which caused per-controller preferences to not get loaded in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing some games to be repeatedly restarted after launching.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We're probably not far off having the Game Recording feature roll out to the stable client now. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-families-has-officially-launched-with-a-big-steam-client-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Families was officially launched in September</a>, this is the next big one coming.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a particular bug lately you want to see solved?</p>

      <title>JRPG-inspired adventure Flowstone Saga with a puzzle-battle system is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Impact Gameworks who made the excellent Tangledeep, their next game Flowstone Saga is officially out now with Linux support. <em>Note: my key was provided by NOVY UNLIMITED PR.</em></p>
<p>Given how much I enjoyed Tangledeep, I was keen to see what Impact Gameworks had up their sleeve next. It started off life as Puzzle Explorers: A Tangledeep Story which had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/07/puzzle-explorers-a-tangledeep-story-announced-and-now-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed crowdfunding campaign</a>, then it came back <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/flowstone-saga-is-an-upcoming-jrpg-inspired-adventure-from-the-dev-of-tangledeep/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of a year later</a> renamed to Flowstone Saga and it was a success this time around. Nice to see that when you have a good idea, sometimes you just need a little more time to get everything right.</p>
<p>Fusing together the basic idea of Tetris and a JRPG-styled adventure, with an intriguing story and some nice pixel art Flowstone Saga really hits a lot of the right notes. It pulls you in right from the start, even the first 5 minutes has you battling away as it teaches you the basics of the falling-blocks battle system and you just want <em>more</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The battle system basics are: drop the blocks to get a full horizontal line, which then gets destroyed and you'll attack the enemy. You start off with basic shapes, with more types of shapes to unlock as you go. It throws in lots extras as well with different types of special blocks you can line up and destroy for more damage, that make it feel just that bit more frantic.</p>
<p>Like a true classic RPG, you can fight multiple people in one battle, and switch targets any time while dropping blocks. You will need to do this at times too, as enemies can charge up special attacks, so this again adds to the additional heart-pounding moments when you really need those damn blocks to line up nicely. On top of that, enemies can throw stuff onto the board you need to clear, as they have harmful effects and become a nuisance. The design of it is mechanically just <em>great</em>. I'm not even particularly a Tetris fan at all, but here it fits in so perfectly that it's just plain fun.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P1ZIUS2DzEc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66c6968680fd0c66934fb896992aee9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P1ZIUS2DzEc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's even more to it, since it's an RPG, you have a level system. Here, you can earn special perks which can directly affect the block-dropping board. You could select to have some blocks pre-filled for example, with more filled at higher levels or put your unlocks into power perks when you hit enemies harder. There's multiple ways to play.</p>
<p>As you explore there's various places that need re-building, and here you do little puzzles instead of battles with the falling blocks. They're optional, but a nice way to help towards upgrades and just a fun little break from the rest of the game. Just a nice little extra added in for explorers and completionists.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to the story, it's thoroughly intriguing too and will keep you guessing for a while. You do learn early on <em>how</em> you do the block-dropping, and <em>where</em> the power specifically for you comes from but it's still quite mysterious on where it originallyy came from to keep you wanting to progress further and explore more of the carefully designed world. Nice bit of town-building outside all the battling too, giving you more of a sense of purpose. And, in true retro-RPG fashion, you can run into everyone's house and open their chest for some extras - has no one ever heard of a lock?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous pixel art with painstakingly handcrafted areas sprawling across multiple biomes.</li>
<li>An epic story grand in scope, but with plenty of heart and charm.</li>
<li>Designed with accessibility in mind – including multiple difficulty options and a turn-based “Hold” mode.</li>
<li>Improve, expand, and decorate the hub town of New Riverstone – helping its citizens and making it your own.</li>
<li>Mini-games with unique and quirky ways to play … and profit!</li>
<li>In co-op assist mode, join the fight with a friend in battle.</li>
<li>Lots of ways to create unique battle strategies and express yourself: equipment customization, perk trees, job system, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One nice touch is that before you even get to the main menu, you're given screen display settings so you can get it how you want it first. More games should do that.</p>
<p>There were a few issues with it at release across Linux / Steam Deck, but the developer has solved them before publishing this so you're good to go with the Native Linux version. Works really nicely.</p>
<p>If you long for the days of sweet-looking 16-bit styled JRPGs, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one. Everything from the art style, to the design of the music and sound effects really reminded me of the golden age of such games years ago. The battle mechanic really adds to the experience too. Absolutely worth grabbing without a second thought needed. Flowstone Saga made me, <em>surprisingly</em>, finally truly appreciate dropping-blocks.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372000/Flowstone_Saga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. And at some point on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/flowstone_saga" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a wonderful reinvention of what Pinball can be</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a few attempts to update Pinball into something new, and Pinball Spire is the latest that's out now. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. <em>Note: my key was sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>It's being called a pinballvania, because it takes some ideas from metroidvanias to provide a rather different experience for pinball fans and turns it into much more of an adventure. Developed by Apparition Games, a tiny indie game studio in Canada. What you get here is a rather unique blend of pinball, platforming and puzzles to make something quirky and different to spend your time with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16792888961728051836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16792888961728051836gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Pinball Spire on Linux</em></p>
<p>What makes it quite different is that each main level in the game acts as a self-contained puzzle for you to solve, with the power of pinball. I'll be honest, pinball is a game I never really got. Like many others though, I did play plenty of Space Cadet in the early Windows days but other than that it never really appealed to me. However, Pinball Spire thankfully understands me and shows me there's another way to do it, one that's just far more exciting and mysterious.</p>
<p>Here you go into each new room not really knowing what to expect from it, and there's quite a lot of surprising variety in how you'll be dealing with each section. Thankfully, you've got a special scouter that you can hit a button to pause the movement at any time to look around and hover over objects to learn more, and hopefully get an idea on how to beat the room.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o4eVLrlq634"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de5a19e810f264c9cc632e385d6cc6e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o4eVLrlq634" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's definitely a little frustration that can be found though. Some parts of it seemed to take me forever, because I just couldn't hit a very specific spot. Other times you're left just waiting for the ball to drop, which can take a while in some cases. Basically, it has all the annoying bits of Pinball too, as well as all the exciting new additions to make it (to me) actually worth a go.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you're not just any old pinball, you have special abilities! Like being able to slow down time to line up a perfect shot (still not easy), but it gives you an actual shot line when you use the slow ability if the ball is over a flipper so you know exactly where it will fire. Seriously though, there's a few times I got worried I was smashing the keys on my keyboard a little <em>too</em> hard when desperately wanting to make a shot. Using these abilities takes up mana too, so you can't just use them all the time, which adds to the challenge of it all.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to the world of Pinballvania! A fusion of arcade pinball mechanics with platforming, puzzles, and exploration—drawing inspiration from retro action-adventure games</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Fun accessories to collect and equip to customize Pip’s appearance!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the launch of Pinball Spire, solo developer Tom Voros said: "I hope players enjoy the atmospheric art and music as they journey through the Pinball Spire in this unconventional take on pinball action!".</p>
<p>It's a really unique experience not to be missed. Fantastic design and great audio to go with it make it a really fun game overall.</p>

      <title>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) gets a first official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) from Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider version 1.1.1 is out now as the first official release to help improve Linux desktop and Steam Deck gaming.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: despite the name, it's not a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run outside of Steam.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First official release of UMU launcher!</p>
<ul>
<li>Should work inside both flatpak and snap</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have official builds for flatpak or snap yet, but instructions are provided on building and using for both:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak</a><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does it actually mean? It means that any app can run games using Proton just like they would from inside Steam so you can get a good experience with Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck from Epic Games, GOG, Amazon and various other stores via apps like Heroic, Lutris and others (when they add in full support for UMU).</p>
<p>This is all part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, and so all apps will end up using the same online database of game-specific fixes that some games need to run properly via protonfixes. In short: better compatibility overall for gaming — eventually.</p>

      <title>6 years after Kickstarter, Orphan Age dev Studio Black Flag shuts without a release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game development is a complicated beast, a constant challenge to get funding and for Studio Black Flag who were building the promising looking Orphan Age it's all over. A game I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/dystopian-life-sim-orphan-age-should-be-on-linux-currently-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2018</a> with their Kickstarter, when the developer was confident on it having Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/767660/view/4679893541742798755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer put it very bluntly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dropping the nautical jargon for clarity, the last few months we’ve been going through bankruptcy procedures in France. This started when communication broke down between us and our publisher, leading to payments not continuing. Alas, with our publisher not continuing funding and no other sources of continued funding to finalize the game, the French government has elected to shut down the studio effective immediately. (Like at the end of the work day today we cannot legally continue working.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the date, they shut as of October 2nd.</p>
<p>To make matters worse when going through the Kickstarter they originally stressed how they "tried to work with publishers, but we never found a compromise that respected Orphan Age's DNA". Clearly they found one, but this is where it gets messier. In the FAQ at the bottom of the announcement it seems their publishing agreement handed over all of the rights of the game noting "I’m not able to get into the specifics of our contract with our publisher, but we simply do not have ownership over Orphan Age in a way that would allow us to shop it to another publisher.".</p>
<p>It might not be the complete end for the game since the publisher <em>could</em> continue it but it's now entirely out of the hands of Studio Black Flag.</p>
<p>Brutal, but a reminder that there's a lot of <em>bad</em> publisher contracts out there, where like this you hand over all your rights just to get the money. The developer has not named the publisher involved.</p>
<p>It's <em>also</em> a reminder that a lot of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding campaigns aren't nearly enough for a developer to fund a full game. Which is why a lot of them also end up with a publisher.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud gets a tutorial Beta and the price goes up soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud is easily (and I keep saying this) one of the best roguelikes ever made, and with the latest Beta it's a lot easier to get into. You might also want to buy it soon before the price rises.</p>
<p>They're making the final preparations for the 1.0 release to leave Early Access later this year and on October 29th the price will be jumping up to $29.99 USD (it's currently $19.99). So now really is a good time to buy it, especially with the latest Beta release.</p>
<p>Writing in an update on Steam they said: "We just released the Caves of Qud tutorial on our beta branch. It’s designed to teach the very basics of Caves of Qud and ends with your character arriving in Joppa, just like in a standard game. If you’re already a seasoned Qud player, you’ll likely be familiar with most of what gets taught (though there may be some useful nuggets for you); if you have a friend who’s been itching to try the game, this is a great opportunity to get them going!"</p>

<p>The tutorial Beta is opt-in on Steam and a separate download on itch.io. Unclear if the Beta is on GOG.</p>
<p>The tutorial along with the last segment of the main story will come into the main branch when 1.0 releases. Which there's no date for just yet. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.17 Beta released with another quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bigger Steam Beta Client recently</a> that had some nice improvements for Game Recording, and various Linux fixes along with another SteamOS Beta - we have yet another tiny SteamOS update.</p>
<p>Valve are really pushing towards the stable release of SteamOS 3.6 for Steam Deck now!</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.6.17 "End of the End of the Line" Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4674264042203547171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wireless</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem where Steam Deck would be unable to connect to certain Wi-Fi 7 access points</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the Beta naming, Valve were likely hoping the <em>previous</em> Beta was the final one. Hopefully this one then. Who knows, maybe they'll treat us to SteamOS 3.6 stable later today, since Valve do have a habit of releasing things on Friday.</p>
<p>To access the current Beta you need to be in the Beta or Preview channel via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII gets Windows system requirements with Linux and macOS details later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games and 2K have released the system requirements for Sid Meier's Civilization VII on Windows, but the Linux and macOS requirements will be coming later.</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention, Sid Meier's Civilization VII coming to Linux officially shouldn't be news since I've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered it</a> now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-february-11-2025-gameplay-reveal-trailer-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple times</a>. But it's a nice reminder for people who missed that.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed</a> off the requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What's this? Only 20GB? You mean big new games don't have to be 100s of GBs? I am shocked.</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841885325528043648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> Firaxis additionally said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also releasing Civilization VII for MacOS and Linux / SteamOS. However, we don't have specs to share for those platforms at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did email them previously to try and find out who is doing the Linux version, but they did not reply. Usually it's Aspyr Media, but they're not listed anywhere this time around so it might be done directly by Firaxis.</p>
<p>The Windows version will have Denuvo Anti-tamper, which doesn't actually have Linux support, so it's likely again the Linux version will not have Denuvo. Additionally, there's no launcher this time around but the game does require a 2K Account for online interactions (but not for offline play).</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV to get an Expansion Pass, plus Gotterdammerung DLC releases November 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that Hearts of Iron IV is getting a big new expansion in Götterdämmerung on November 14th, and they're bringing the whole Expansion Pass idea from other games to Hearts of Iron IV as well.</p>
<p>For the new Expansion Pass you get a 20% overall discount versus buying individually and the first pass will give you all of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant unlock of three new 3d tank models and a music track.</li>
<li>The Götterdämmerung expansion (Nov 14th 2024).</li>
<li>The Graveyard of Empires country pack (Q1 2025).</li>
<li>Prototype Vehicles unit pack (Q3 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for Götterdämmerung itself it's very much focused on Germany, which Paradox said is "something many of you have been clamouring for for many years". Sounds like a great addition to the game with a super-weapons feature and so this expansion is also giving you some new special tools. As Paradox developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>War drives all sorts of technological innovation in an attempt to out-do opponents and although many projects ultimately never saw the battlefield, Götterdämmerung aims to tie together existing research systems with a new experimental research mechanic that allows for both historical and less historical but plausible super-projects to be pursued. The research process will become an important part of gameplay, with scientists, map-located experimental facilities, and supporting infrastructure all combining to produce a wide variety of outcomes that can augment your forces or change the very nature of the war you are fighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vfpjRVIo9X8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e34ce189c5168003d22d9cae1e8cbdbe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vfpjRVIo9X8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Based on regular player numbers, this seems to be the currently most popular grand strategy game from Paradox.</p>

      <title>Monty Pythonesque humour fused with Renaissance art comes in Death of the Reprobate on November 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer Joe Richardson is bringing on another brilliantly funny fusion of Monty Pythonesque humour with artwork styled like moving Renaissance paintings in Death of the Reprobate. This is their third game in this style following on from Four Last Things in 2017 and The Procession to Calvary from 2020.</p>
<p>It's a standalone game, technically, so you don't need to have played or know anything from the previous games but it does continue the overall story of Immortal John.</p>
<p>More about it: "In stark defiance of his name, Immortal John is dying. His heir, 'Malcolm the Shit', graciously takes a break from ordering cruel and unusual executions to visit the dying man and seek his inheritance - I mean, fulfill his final wishes. Unfortunately for Malcolm, the promised title and riches will only be awarded if he completes seven good deeds before sundown. Guided by the Lord God Almighty (quite literally - if you’re stuck, He’s the one holding a big arrow), the player must set forth into a surreal world of real Renaissance paintings and help a host of preposterous characters in order to earn Malcolm his inheritance."</p>
<p>Announced today it's going to release with Linux support on November 7th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3ql6wnJwT8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7876ae2529ab7acb293fc2ccfdf72ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3ql6wnJwT8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork – Renaissance, Rococo and even a hint of Romanticism, to be a little more precise. Hundreds of paintings, spanning hundreds of years, are all brought together into one consistent world.</li>
<li>Classical Music – Music by Eduardo Antonello. Period appropriate music that adapts as the story progresses, recorded using real medieval/renaissance instruments.</li>
<li>Standalone Story – Death of the Reprobate is set in the same world as Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary, and features some recurring characters/themes, but it can be played independently.</li>
<li>Highbrow Buffoonery – Lofty subject matter is treated with gleeful flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about it, the developer Joe Richardson said: "I burnt myself the fuck out six months ago but the game wasn't done so I kept going and now I feel genuinely unwell lol I HOPE YOU LIKE IT!"</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739900/Death_of_the_Reprobate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>More info on the Valve (Steam) collab with Arch Linux and potential future hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the big news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-steam-begin-a-direct-collaboration-with-arch-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve (Steam) began a collaboration with Arch Linux</a>, to help fund two very specific parts of the Linux distribution. Now, we have a bit more info on what it means.</p>
<p>After an interview recently from the A1RM4X YouTube channel with an Arch Linux developer, Antiz, they took to Reddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lpne5p0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explain</a> things a little bit further to help people understand what's happening. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, the way packages are currently built / managed still requires a few manual interventions from Package Maintainers (e.g. triggering the build itself and signing the built packages afterwards). As of now, supporting multiple architectures would mean multiplying those manual steps by the number of supported / targeted architectures. With the current number of packages compared to the current number of (volunteers) Package Maintainers maintaining them, Arch is not able to handle the extra amount of effort that it would imply.</p>
<p>A central build service and a central secure signing enclave (the two projects concerned by that Valve "sponsoring") would streamline the overall process by allowing automated build and signing for packages without requiring any manual steps / interventions from Package Maintainers anymore (and it will also allow to increase the security of the process as a side benefit). Only such a streamlined / automated workflow would allow us to start working on supporting multiple architectures without implying to multiply the current amount of required effort.</p>
<p>In other words, those projects are prerequisites to start working on multiple architectures support in a clean &amp; sane way, which is a end goal shared by both Arch and Valve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically, a lot of it is towards supporting multiple architectures. And with the news that Valve are seemingly working on supporting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some form of Arm and Android support</a> (likely for a future VR headset), this definitely makes sense. Especially when Valve already use Arch Linux for SteamOS on the Steam Deck, it seems increasingly likely that Valve will use an Arch Linux base for what comes next.</p>
<p>Antiz has also been replying to other comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lps1xud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, in one post noting that it is very much their "end goal" for Arch Linux to support multiple architectures.</p>
