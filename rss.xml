      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena re-implementation OpenTESArena gets a graphics code overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like this project is coming along nicely, and I do very much love seeing classics get revived with open source game engine re-implementations. OpenTESArena for The Elder Scrolls: Arena has a new release out.</p>
<p>It's still considered "pre-alpha" with proper gameplay to come later, but worth keeping an eye on, because projects like this can end up doing some amazing things (just look at OpenMW for Morrowind!). This is the first release since 2021!</p>
<p>Speaking about the OpenTESArena 0.15.0 release the developer said: "This release overhauls the graphics code to more closely match the look of the original game. The renderer now also uses meshes, shaders, and draw calls normally found in an OpenGL or Vulkan engine.</p>
<p>Overall FPS is below average due to draw calls not being batched yet and the rasterizer being relatively unoptimized (it was very challenging to reliably coax all compilers to output good assembly, so there is still room for improvement). One optimization of interest however is the addition of a voxel quadtree for efficiently testing visibility to the camera."</p>
<p>Check out their showcase video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LEjsv2AehOg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9cc4c86c2cbfcd13a943c04c88a81195.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LEjsv2AehOg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New 3D software renderer:
<ul>
<li>Closely matches original game's 256 color lighting (special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Carmina16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@Carmina16</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Arena data files detection (now checks default C: Steam install on Windows).</li>
<li>Added exclusive fullscreen option.</li>
<li>Added tall pixel correction option.</li>
<li>Initial work on player attributes (@gazorpo).</li>
<li>Improved screenshot saving.</li>
<li>Minor change to player movement to match original game.</li>
<li>ARM64 macOS support.</li>
<li>Replaced debug collision option with ghost mode that allows flying.</li>
<li>Replaced DebugFast build config with ReleaseGenericNoLTO.</li>
<li>Removed time scale option.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Try the demo for The Protagonish, an adventure game where you don&#39;t control the adventurer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is a bit more on the unique side isn't it? I know we have plenty of classic adventure game fans in the GOL readership, but what about one where you don't actual control the adventurer? Check out The Protagonish.</p>
<p>It has all the usual marks of a classic point and click adventure game, but you're not the main character. Instead, you jump between the villagers, and choose to guide or distract the adventurer from their quest, with puzzles, comedy dialogue choices, and mysteries to uncover. Absolutely love the idea!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MFu972ETz9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e96b854de5311227f7d71549078691d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MFu972ETz9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With full voice acting and plenty of colourful characters, backed up by some lovely hand-drawn animations, this is one you should check out.</p>
<p>More: "Explore the beautifully hand-drawn village, and discover the lives and plans of four varied characters in this short game with multiple endings. Through your dialogue choices, be a shopkeeper out for the best deal, a monk who's taken a vow of silence, or a miner who's had a bump on the head and not quite saying what he means. And finally there is the mysterious beastie..."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994780/The_Protagonish/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try the demo on Steam</a> right now. It will be available with Native Linux support at release.</p>

      <title>Preserve is a wonderfully chilled and beautiful relaxing nature-building game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love tile-based chilled puzzle games like Dorfromantik, you'll probably really love Preserve. This one is all about repopulating a wasteland to create a vibrant and flourishing ecosystem. <em>Note: key via the developer.</em></p>
<p>Just released into Early Access, it's available now with Native Linux support and from my testing it really does work great. One of the most chilled and relaxing games I've played recently, with a peaceful atmosphere that allows you to almost zone-out with it and as you're placing down all types of tiles to bring the world to life. It doesn't get much calmer than this while playing games.</p>
<p>Very similar in style to the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/relaxing-and-gorgeous-city-builder-dorfromantik-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/tiny-atolls-is-a-comfy-and-relaxing-minimalist-city-builder/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tiny Atolls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/colourful-city-builder-islanders-has-officially-released-for-linux-and-its-really-lovely/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ISLANDERS</a> where you start with nothing and gradually build up a score of points based on what tiles you put down, and building up a combination score from having multiple of the same together. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gWKFzR1oO5U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ecc3dc533df7046f541c5ee74cb0a77.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gWKFzR1oO5U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I especially love the way you expand the world. Instead of you revealing more as you go, you build up points to purchase a new land expansion, which you place around the existing land in a place and position of your choosing, allowing you to really get it how you want it. </p>
<p>That, and the vertical system. Here it's not just placing down tiles, you're gradually building upwards as well with tiles on top of tiles. Eventually, you end up with a ridiculously vibrant world full of different colours and habitats for flora and fauna.</p>
<p>While it is a puzzle game, it's much more on the chilled side, the points system is reasonably easy to keep going with it, so you don't particularly need to worry about it much at all. Although, if you're aiming for a real high score, it will stop and make you think on your tile placements a lot more. So it has a nice balance of ease and challenge overall.</p>
<p>In Early Access the developers plan to continue building it up over the next year to include more biomes (there's three currently) with unique ecosystems, flora, fauna and so on. They also want to add in more puzzles and challenges to deepen the gameplay overall which sounds great. They have a truly wonderful start here, I can't wait to see more from it.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the InfinityFlex a fully foldable Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TUXEDO are flexing their hardware chops here with the InfinityFlex, a fully foldable Linux laptop so you can use it wherever and however you want. <em>No that's not drool on my top, honest.</em></p>
<p>With the ability to fold the screen right down on top of the unit, you can use it as a standard laptop or more like a tablet. Since it has a pressure-sensitive touch display, pairing it up with a pen you can use it for all sorts of artwork projects too. Pretty light as well at only 1.5KG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12097365151723202057gol1.png"/></p>
<p>TUXEDO put some fun work into this one by the sounds of it. They said "soon as the device is used in monitor or tablet mode, the keyboard and touchpad are automatically deactivated to prevent incorrect entries, the screen content is rotated according to the chassis orientation and TUXEDO OS also adapts its UI to touch operation".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>14-inch IPS Touch Display, 1920 x 1200, sRGB color gamut: 100 %, Brightness: 400 nits.</li>
<li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211, Bluetooth 5.3.</li>
<li>55 Wh battery.</li>
<li>Intel Core i5-1335U, Intel Iris Xe Graphics.</li>
<li>DDR4-3200 MHz SO-DIMM, 16GB on the base model.</li>
<li>500 GB Samsung 980 (NVMe PCIe 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks and sounds like a real nice machine.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityFlex-14-Gen1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TUXEDO store</a>. Available for pre-order with shipping after September 16th. The <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Wacom-Bamboo-Ink-Active-Stylus-grey.tuxedo#gallery" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pen</a> is sold separately.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader plugins should no longer cause bootloops on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Decky Loader developers have announced that their plugin system for Steam Deck should no longer cause bootloops with the latest pre-release build.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">News I covered just recently</a>, users discovered a number of plugins that would cause the Steam Deck to get stuck where the Big Picture Mode just wouldn't appear. Thankfully you could fix it with some manual effort, but that should no longer be needed.</p>
<p>As of "<a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0-pre8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prerelease v3.0.0-pre8</a>", the developers noted it fixes a "race condition causing crash loops". Additionally, posting in their Discord server, developer "Train" <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960459928538087424/1271209426803626015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also taking steps to ensure future issues do not cause breakage to this degree and to notify users of when plugins are delisted or issues with Decky Loader are discovered by us or made known to us by users. Thanks everyone for being patient and contributing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned in a GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/comment_id=267073" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>[â¦]</small> To those wondering, we're currently working on an MOTD feature to allow us to better notify users of issues with plugins and we're working on delisting broken plugins.<br/>
As of the most recent pre-release of Decky, v3.0.0-pre7, we now have a screen and logic that catches these loops and stops decky and should allow you to find and remove any of the effected plugins. We also have future plans to ensure plugins are easier to report as broken but we don't have anything concrete in that regard yet. Have a lovely week everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the developer who fixed the issue "AAGaming" also mentioned in a GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/comment_id=267110" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've fixed this in the latest prerelease (v3.0.0-pre8), broken plugins shouldn't be able to cause bootloops anymore. It was caused by an extremely hard to find race condition in a new feature of @decky/ui (previously decky-frontend-lib)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So thankfully, you should be pretty safe to use the latest pre-release version again with various plugins on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Decky Loader team certainly have their work cut out for them, given that all of this is community-made with no direct support for plugins from Valve. Hopefully in future Valve might consider some sort of API to help make their job easier.</p>

      <title>Blackjack roguelike adventure Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to break Blackjack? Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers has you battle your way through a seedy tavern filled with gambling addicted townspeople in this Blackjack roguelike adventure.</p>
<p>More about it: Begin your adventure in a tavern that is home to a unique, corrupted version of blackjack you have never played before. You will need to pick up the rules and adapt to them as you progress through the tavern, challenging a colourful cast of blackjack-addicted townspeople. Discover the mystery of who runs this twisted casino as you progress through the tavern to take them down.</p>
<p>Complete with over 300 cards, you wonât just be drawing from a traditional deck to take down greedy opponents. Teeming with a wacky assortment of cards ranging from birthday cards to tarot cards, thereâs plenty of unique combinations you can use to outwit their fiendish foes and emerge victorious in this stakes roguelike.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zo86D4qDV2c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/694578d8ac25db346762fa79f8b96d4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zo86D4qDV2c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their PR team didn't reply to my code request on this one, so I've not personally had a proper chance to play with it yet. Looks great though, probably a good one for fans of Balatro.</p>

      <title>DOOM + DOOM II get bundled together with new enhanced versions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today id Software and Bethesda Softworks announced a new bundling of the original DOOM + DOOM II, with a whole bunch of enhancements using Nightdive Studio's KEX engine. A free update for existing owners too.</p>
<p>While we have various source port projects like the fantastic GZDoom, the newer KEX engine versions will at least make them play a lot nicer on modern systems completely out of the box. There's definitely something to be said for convenience.</p>
<p>Plus you get all these extras now too (from the Steam page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online, cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players.</li>
<li>Community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.</li>
<li>Choose between the original midi DOOM and DOOM II soundtracks or the modern IDKFA versions by Andrew Hulshult (including brand-new DOOM II recordings).</li>
<li>Improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution.</li>
<li>Now on the KEX engine.</li>
<li>BOOM source compatibility makes it possible for hundreds of community-created mods from the past 25 years to be published in-game.</li>
<li>Accessibility options, such as a modern font to improve legibility, high contrast mode, text-to-speech, speech-to-text multiplayer chat and more.</li>
<li>Translated into 8 new languages: Mexican Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Existing Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals.</li>
<li>Modern controller support.</li>
<li>Weapon carousel for faster weapon switching.</li>
<li>Improved mouse and keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Local split-screen deathmatch and co-op for up to 4 players.</li>
<li>Featured community modsÂ²'Â³, including REKKR, Revolution!, Syringe, Double Impact, Arrival, and more! Expect an ever-expanding list of single player mods to be added by the community modders.</li>
<li>60 FPS and native 16:9 support â up to 1080p.</li>
<li>Restored original in-game music using original hardware.</li>
<li>Quick Save/Load support.</li>
<li>DeHacked mod support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-4-xswoPRpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca62ee6064c61cfc96471bcbdbe9dc21.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-4-xswoPRpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that, a brand new episode was also released named Legacy of Rust. This was made in collaboration by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames. Legacy of Rust is the newest episode for DOOM, and the first official episode since DOOM II to feature new demons and weapons. This 16-map Episode is broken up into two 8 map sections: The Vulcan Abyss and Counterfeit Eden.</p>
<p>The online features do need a Bethesda account, just to be clear. Plus, the original DOS versions of DOOM (1993) and DOOM II are still included so it's not like they've just been wiped away, which is good to see for proper preservation. So no need to complain about the classics not needing to be touched, they're still there.</p>

      <title>Sober is a new way to play Roblox on Linux from the Vinegar team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Roblox does still remain blocked on Linux with Wine, as usual the community finds a way. The Vinegar team recently revealed Sober, a currently closed-source specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox.</p>
<p>So if you're really desperate to get Roblox on Linux, Sober seems like the main way right now. Since it uses the Android version, you do need to <em>manually</em> download a Roblox APK which can be done from various mirror websites like <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/roblox-corporation/roblox/roblox-2-636-626-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apkmirror</a>. There's lots of these sites where you can grab an APK, do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>The Vinegar team explain: "Sober crafts a specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox. Effectively, it bridges the small gap between Android and Linux, allowing for a native unofficial port."</p>
<p>As you can see from my shot below, it works:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1118126851723133013gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1118126851723133013gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it's available to download as Flatpak, but not from Flathub as they're hosting it themselves.</p>
<p>Like before when playing Roblox in Wine though, it's possible (and probable) it will be blocked eventually. Although, it may end up being a little more difficult with something like this. </p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://sober.vinegarhq.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sober website</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 desktop environment COSMIC alpha now available to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have today released the first alpha preview for you to try out COSMIC, their brand new home-grown desktop environment. Built with Rust, it should hopefully feel pretty familiar to most Linux users with a visual style that matches up to their current GNOME-based desktop.</p>
<p>While they're building it for their own Pop!_OS, with a alpha iso for Pop, it's designed to be cross-distro and they even have ways for you to test it out directly on a few other distributions already.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21289625901723132053gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21289625901723132053gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 1 using automatic tiling for opened windows</em></p>
<p>Their vision for COSMIC: "COSMIC began as our answer to user feedback weâve received on improving Pop!_OS. The new desktop environment introduces a custom theming system, streamlined Auto-tiling, new core applications including an app store, and provides you more control over your workflow. Written in the Rust programming language, COSMIC is more stable, more secure, and better optimized for performance."</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is the first alpha build, there will likely be many bugs and unfinished features. Going by the press details they sent this is what's currently complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Settings pages + applets for daily use for most users
<ul>
<li>Applets provide many settings needs
<ul>
<li>Connecting to bluetooth and wireless networks. Choosing audio input and output devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlight COSMICâs unique features
<ul>
<li>Panel and Dock Customization</li>
<li>Appearance and Themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OS Interfaces
<ul>
<li>Panels, Launcher, App Library, Greeter, Dialogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apps
<ul>
<li>Settings, Files, Text Editor, Store, Terminal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compositor features
<ul>
<li>Auto-Tiling, Snapping (Manual-Tiling), Stacking, and Sticky Windows</li>
<li>Excellent nvidia hybrid graphics support</li>
<li>Fractional scaling</li>
<li>Wayland native with XWayland support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is what's still to be done:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Numerous Settings pages</li>
<li>Frosted effect for OS interfaces</li>
<li>Variable refresh rate</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Initial Setup
<ul>
<li>Need to set time manually</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workspaces features, animations, and refinement</li>
<li>Lots of COSMIC Files work</li>
<li>Bug fixes and refinement</li>
<li>Compositor software rendering
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing in VMs requires hardware acceleration</strong></li>
<li>GNOME Boxes uses software acceleration but itâs pretty smooth</li>
<li>VirtualBox requires enabling VT-x/AMD-V and Enable Nested Paging</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official website</a>.</p>
<p>A promising start to what could be a really interesting Linux desktop environment, although as expected it is on the rough side being in alpha right now you can clearly see where they're going with it. I can imagine this becoming <em>really</em> popular.</p>
<p>When you've tried it be sure to let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steel &amp; Blood is a huge upgrade for horde battler Rogue: Genesia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue: Genesia is easily one of the best survivor-like horde games, and it just got even better with the huge Steel &amp; Blood update.</p>
<p>More about it: Walk upon a new world and slay foes endangering it. Rogue : Genesia is an action rogue-lite game, where you fight relentless hordes consisting of hundreds and thousands of monsters, make your build, break the balance, defeat bosses and save one of the many worlds.</p>
<p>The new Steel &amp; Blood update has added in a highly customizable equipment system. Once you've played it for a bit you'll unlock access to it, allowing you to equip various different items much like a traditional RPG. All items you find have their own level and tier, allowing you to keep upgrading and swapping. Items have various modifiers, and you can recycle items to learn them, to allow you to then craft the modifier onto another item. Sounds like a lot of fun for mixing up your runs. There's a lot more like a new world, a new avatar to play as, a new zone variant, various performance improvements and the list goes on and on.</p>

      <title>Balatro hits 2 million sales and a major free gameplay update is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular recent releases on Steam that's Steam Deck Verified (and works great on desktop Linux), Balatro has done really well.</p>
<p>More about it: The poker roguelike. Balatro is a hypnotically satisfying deckbuilder where you play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos.</p>
<p>Especially great, considering it's from a solo developer, to hit 2 million sales in a few months is absolutely amazing. Well deserved too, it is a wonderful game. The developer seems really nice too, <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioning</a> recently on X (Twitter) that they've ensured it can't be turned into an actual gambling game:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21224054611723109103gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the outside this might make 0 sense but I hate the thought of Balatro becoming a true gambling game so much that when I recently created my will I stipulated that the Balatro IP may never be sold or licensed to any gambling company/Casino</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what's to come next? Teased in a post on Steam is the next major update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6204970791723109215gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The first major announcement in this campaign is that there will be a major gameplay update coming to Balatro in 2025. This update will bring new ideas and strategies to the game and will be released across all platforms. And as a token of huge appreciation to the gameâs brilliant and passionate community, the update will be completely free.</p>

      <title>Prehistoric farming life sim Roots of Pacha 1.2 is out now, plus a &#39;massive&#39; update on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roots of Pacha from Soda Den has a fresh free update out now in version 1.2, and they're not slowing down with more big free updates planned.</p>
<p>More about it: Be a part of a thriving stone age community. Discover "ideas", domesticate crops, befriend animals, and contribute to the growth of your village. Play with friends in co-op or explore the early days of civilization in single-player.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update brings a huge upgrade to how children work in the game with them now going to school, they will hang out together, develop personalities, discover what future professions they wish to do and more. Children's different combinations of parents, personality quirks, and prospective professions help unearth earnable gifts and distinct dialog.</p>
<p>You also get new skin tones and hair colours to establish more unique villager identities. Invent unknown technologies from new Ideas to provide time-saving tools like the olla watering pot. Tame mammoths, spiders, cave lions, wolves, and more as new mount options â play fetch with them and obtain valuable resources like herbs and meat.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gi5VaBLplJw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f31b85378ba1edc282c515cac4ba133.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gi5VaBLplJw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With that out of the way, what's next? Soda Den are promising a "massive update underway with two new regions, fishing in canoes/rafts, camping, ball sport, iron, volcano caves, and more" which sounds really exciting. Although it's not due until next year.</p>
<p>Roots of Pacha has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roots-of-pacha?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245560/Roots_of_Pacha/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.9 Beta for Steam Deck curiously mentions the ASUS ROG Ally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a pretty important set of bug fixes for the Steam Deck with the new SteamOS 3.6.9 Beta, plus an interesting mention of the ASUS ROG Ally that could point to things to come.</p>
<p>Their release notes mention how they "Added support for extra ROG Ally keys", which could potentially (finally!) point towards a SteamOS release for more devices. However, to temper some expectations here, it's probably more likely it's just Steam Input changes rolled into the SteamOS Beta update before they arrive in the main Steam Client Beta for all platforms (which hasn't seen an update yet). Still, nice to have hope right? Worth also pointing out that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/better-asus-rog-ally-x-support-on-linux-is-coming-with-a-big-kernel-patch/" target="_blank">Better ASUS ROG Ally X support on Linux is coming with a big kernel patch</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all that's from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4361258795952118017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for the update named "Megafixer" (I wonder why they picked that code-name from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/the-jackbox-megapicker-fixed-to-stop-megabreaking-your-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huh</a>?):</p>

      <title>Second Dinner (MARVEL SNAP) now investing in W4 Games for Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clearly, <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> is going places, with more and more games using this cross-platform free and open source game engine that doesn't require royalty payments and now they've pulled in Second Dinner who developed MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>Announced via a press release it notes that <a href="https://www.w4games.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">W4 Games</a>, the company set up by Godot Engine contributors, and Second Dinner have entered into a "multi-year strategic partnership" with Second Dinner planning "to build the most ambitious Godot game yet" and so Second Dinner has joined W4 Games as a strategic investor.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>âWhen we formed W4 Games a couple of years ago, our vision was to make Godot the game engine of choice for superstar game developers. We are thrilled to announce this collaboration since Second Dinner represents exactly our visionâ shares Nicola Farronato, W4 Games Co-CEO.<br/>
<br/>
âSecond Dinner has always been an inspiration for me, a company that is never afraid to break new grounds in all senses. It will be a huge pleasure to work with them ensuring the success of their future titlesâ adds Juan Linietsky, Godot Engine creator and W4 Games Co-CEO.<br/>

      <title>Valve working on a new game that could be Half-Life 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Take this with your usual scepticism, but it appears Valve are working on another new game (no not Deadlock that leaked previously) which may end up being Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>News comes thanks to a post on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/valve_is_working_on_a_title_under_the_codename/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, that links to a certain actress's official website that notes they're doing Voice Over for "Project White Sands (video game)" from Valve on their rÃ©sumÃ©. Their website was later updated to remove the mention, but I've confirmed via the Internet Archive it was previously listed.</p>
<p>While it's not proof and it doesn't necessarily mean anything will actually release (Valve cancelled various games before release previously), clearly Valve are doing <em>something</em> interesting here at the moment. White Sands is the giveaway, since it's a U.S National Park based in New Mexico which is where the Black Mesa Research Facility is located. So uh, that's a pretty strong hint right? However, the name could also be a red herring to intentionally throw anyone off from potential leaks too.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting at this point that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life: Alyx</a> is currently 66% off until August 19th. It's been as low as that a couple of times before but it <em>is</em> still the lowest Valve has ever put it so far. Might be a good time to check it out if you haven't already, perhaps with the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life Alyx NoVR mod</a> if you don't have a VR headset. I won't spoil it, but it's an <em>important</em> game.</p>
<p>Data miner Tyler McVicker also covered it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36gF6eiCsqU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> going over some details.</p>

<p>Uh oh. Not only did we recently have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/the-jackbox-megapicker-fixed-to-stop-megabreaking-your-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the issue with The Jackbox Megapicker</a> breaking the Steam Deck, but now plugins via Decky Loader too.</p>
<p>The main issue here is with the upcoming 3.x.x release series, which has been in development for a while now. The issue shouldn't be present with the current stable 2.x.x series.</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement on the Decky Loader Discord, developer "Train" <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960459928538087424/1270616253991747616" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Music Control plugin is delisted and should be uninstalled as it causes Steam BPM to "bootloop" in newer versions of Decky Loader such as the current pre-releases of 3.X.X. We also have users experiencing the same issue without that plugin installed so I would recommend manually deleting one plugin at a time to see which plugin is [affecting] you. You will need to delete any [affected] plugin(s) from <code class="inline-code">~/homebrew/plugins/</code> (You will need to use sudo to delete the files, suggest using konsole and using <code class="inline-code">sudo rm -r /path/to/plugin</code>). Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Semicolon on a USB keyboard connected to your deck while the deck is booting up and before it crashes, should get you to the Desktop and allow you to bypass the "bootloops" and delete the plugin. A pre-connected Bluetooth keyboard should also do the trick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One user in the Decky Loader Discord has been <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960284126701813770/1270711371301912596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">collecting</a> the names of various plugins that cause the bootloop issue and those that are okay (credit to user "IáIS áá®á·ááªá©"). This list keeps changing, but this is what they noted at time of posting the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following plugins break Decky Loader 3.x.x pre-release <u>(unbootable Deck):</u></p>
<ul>
<li>DeckRoulette 1.1.3-0950f29</li>
<li>GameView Music 1.1.0-1</li>
<li>MicroSDeck 0.9.1-1 <em>(see list below)</em></li>
<li>MusicControl 1.1.5 <em>(see list below)</em></li>
<li>Network Info 1.0.1-13b914b</li>
<li>Remote Play Whatever 1.0.0</li>
<li>System Toolbox 1.0.2-1</li>
</ul>
<p>The following plugins DO NOT break Decky Loader 3.x.x pre-release:</p>
<ul>
<li>MetaDeck 2.0.2-4a7335d</li>
<li>MicroSDeck 0.10.3</li>
<li>MusicControl 1.1.6-a93c611</li>
<li>Save Manager 0.0.1-0ef2a15</li>
<li>Syncthing 0.2.1-389a842</li>
<li>EmuDecky 1.0.7</li>
</ul>
<p>The following plugins DO NOT break Decky Loader 3.x.x pre-release, but are themselves broken on it, while they were working fine on 2.12.3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Controller Tools 1.2.2</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you might want to go and check what you're using with Decky Loader, before any plugins may cause you some issues. Decky Loader is a community project, not supported by Valve, so you're generally on your own for issues it causes and will have to fix any problems yourself. As much as I like the idea of Decky Loader, it does seem to cause a fair few problems.</p>

      <title>DRL (Doom, the Roguelike) is coming to Steam as Jupiter Hell Classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jupiter Hell Classic is the demake of a remake of a roguelike unmake of a famous 1993 FPS shooter. Rip and Tear!</p>
<p>Confused yet? You should be. Developer ChaosForge made DRL, which was originally called DoomRL until they had a legal issue. A fast and furious coffee-break roguelike game, that is heavily inspired by the popular FPS game Doom. Later, they made their own proper IP with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/fantastic-roguelike-jupiter-hell-gets-a-new-scary-boss-new-locations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jupiter Hell</a>, one of my all-time favourite roguelikes for it's awesome movement system as well as the fun action.</p>
<p>Now, they're <em>returning</em> to DRL, turning it into Jupiter Hell Classic. They said they're "updating the game's mechanics and graphics and changing the setting to match the one featured in its acclaimed remake - Jupiter Hell - and bringing the game to Steam players, as a fully-featured commercial release".</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic, unforgiving, top-down, grid-based roguelike gameplay.</li>
<li>2D tile-based graphics.</li>
<li>Diagonal movement.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for all your nostalgia modding needs!</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow it along <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126530/Jupiter_Hell_Classic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the Steam page</a>. Releasing later this year with Linux support.</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 is out now with Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the original greats from the original indie games boom has returned, World of Goo 2 from 2DBOY and Tomorrow Corporation is now available.</p>
<p>While it's exclusive to the Epic Store when it comes to launchers, you can also buy it with Native Linux support DRM-free directly from their website. So no launcher at all is needed for it.</p>
<p>As for why it's an Epic Exclusive they said this: "World of Goo 2 would not exist if Epic had not helped us fund the game! We were able to hire artists and engineers for multiple years to help us build the biggest game we've ever made. We're grateful for this! You've likely seen similar arrangements with other games, and I imagine ours is comparable."</p>

      <title>Next Heroic Games Launcher release to include initial GOG Galaxy support</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everyone's favourite Linux games launcher has added yet another milestone feature thanks to Linguin and other Heroic contributors. The <em>development</em> version of Heroic now uses a project named <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comet</a> to translate a game's GOG Galaxy API calls using a platform-agnostic SDK.</p>
<p>What this means is that now you can play GOG games that previously required the (non-Linux native) GOG Galaxy client!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/565032711722967971gol1142.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/565032711722967971gol1142.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Synthetik: Legion Rising without (left) and with (right) comet running.</em></p>
<p>This feature has now been merged into the main git branch and will be included in the <em>next</em> release. If you have a burning desire to try this feature now, you can either build the git Heroic version, or run comet manually, which I will describe below.</p>
<p>To run comet standalone, first head to the <a href="http://github.com/imLinguin/comet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">project page</a> or <a href="http://github.com/imLinguin/comet/releases/tag/v0.1.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download the 0.1.2 release</a>. Next <a href="http://github.com/imLinguin/comet/releases/download/v0.1.2/dummy-service.zip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download</a> and unpack the dummy GOG service and run<br/>
<code class="inline-code">install-dummy-service.bat</code> in the GOG game's wine prefix. You can do this using heroic by going to game settings, selecting "Run EXE on Prefix," then selecting the <code class="inline-code">.bat</code> file from the directory you downloaded. Finally, make sure that you are logged into your GOG account in your heroic client, and run <code class="inline-code">comet --from-heroic --username</code> (your GOG user name) from a terminal. Note that you can do the same using Lutris by changing <code class="inline-code">--from-heroic</code> to <code class="inline-code">--from-lutris</code>. This will launch the comet daemon using your GOG credentials from the Heroic launcher. If you have any problems you can post here or head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/JWV9FSYY5w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic discord</a> for support.</p>
<p>And you're done! Fire up the GOG game of your choice and revel in the multiplayer madness! Another banger addition by the Heroic team.</p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next announced for 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the success of the downhill extreme sports game Descenders, developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots have announced the much bigger Descenders Next is coming.</p>
<p>They said that while the original focused on mountain biking, and did a pretty good job of it (I certainly enjoyed the challenge), this time they're aiming much higher. Their goal, they said, is to "create the only extreme sports game that anyone will ever need, ever again". When it releases sometime in 2025 it will come with "as many extreme sports as we can" that currently includes the addition of boarding sports and as long as players keep coming back they plan to keep adding more to it.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers adds support for HoYo and Nexon launchers, easier EA App repairs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few days ago the great NonSteamLaunchers project, to help you set up various third-party launchers on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, had a new release adding support for even more launchers.</p>
<p>This is a project that can really streamline the process to get launchers installed and added to Steam. It now includes support for the HoYo Launcher (HoYoPlay) and Nexon Launcher as of version 3.9.2. That's in addition to the already supported Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar Games Launcher, Ubisoft Connect and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4069179401722962038gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - HoYoPlay</em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.9.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Desktop Version:<br/>

<p>Decky Plugin Version (Decky Loader Testing Store):</p>
<p>Added the "Uninstall" button<br/>
Legacy Game Scanner was added</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Megapicker fixed to stop megabreaking your Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What Valve <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=24585659" rel="noopener" target="_blank">called</a> the "jackbrick megabricker" (ouch), The Jackbox Megapicker should now stop breaking your Steam Deck after the latest update to the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>For those who missed it: recently the team at party game developer Jackbox Games, Inc. released their launcher called The Jackbox Megapicker to bring together all their games and help you get your party started a little easier considering how many they've released now.</p>
<p>However, it came with an issue where it would break your Steam Deck. Valve ended up forcing it to use Proton to get around the issue but now the Jackbox team have released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828500/view/4368013560344221505" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> that amongst other improvements notes "A small subset of Steam Deck users experienced a boot loop if they restarted their Steam Deck after launching The Jackbox Megapicker. This has been resolved in the Megapicker.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17528772141722961260gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. Plus don't forget you can also grab a free to keep copy of their game Drawful 2 until August 28th to celebrate the launch.</p>

      <title>Pull off sick tricks and take down hordes of demons in Motordoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motordoom is the latest entry in the survivor-like horde shooter genre popularised by Vampire Survivors, and this one has you do some freestyle-sports.</p>
<p>Quite a unique combination this one. Take down monsters with various weapons and abilities while performing tricks. All the usual mechanics you would expect in such a horde shooter with lots and lots of upgrades to make every run just that little bit different. Here you also get to earn experience by combining trick combos with kills!</p>
<p>It's a really cool idea, and I did quite enjoy the demo for Motordoom too. Completely over the top once it gets going. If you love action-packed games that are a bit different it's an easy purchase.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EwWU0nWNOMk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/263f8221c0688d0fec446b8305160d6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EwWU0nWNOMk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it now released the developer mentioned they plan to add in a final level and a final boss, more skins, cards, potentially some new characters and they're also working on modding support so that could be really interesting for this one due to the combination of genres.</p>
<p>The developer also released a quick patch recently which fixed up some visual effects in the Linux version.</p>
<p>Available with Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Save a town from paranormal infestation in the point and click adventure The founders of [redacted]</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your point and click adventures? Here's a fresh one for you! The founders of [redacted] from Relatively Painless Games looks like a great addition to your gaming library.</p>
<p>You play as Ines, a 19-year-old (yes, she's older now!) aspiring writer. Hoping to find peace and inspiration for her second novel, she's about to spend a few weeks in [redacted], her uncle Lee's hometown. On her arrival she finds a mysteriously empty town, and her book-writing plans are derailed as she is recruited to save [redacted] from a paranormal infestation.</p>
<p>This is actually the fourth in a series of adventures, although completely standalone so you don't need to have played any others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="W_VbFulC4Xo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76d624ee566253da81537d0734b53a63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/W_VbFulC4Xo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer emailed this in and mentioned "Not only is the game available for Linux, it was fully developed on Linux and I even convinced the artist to install Linux on their laptop, so a good chunk of the art was done on Linux too!". Nice to see even more game developers using Linux to make games!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Standalone story: knowledge of the previous games not required!</li>
<li>Gorgeous pixel-art graphics, with pixel-perfect scaling.</li>
<li>Ghosts! Witches! Inept public officials! This game has it all!</li>
<li>Immersive and dynamic original soundtrack.</li>
<li>Logical puzzles with solutions that make senseâ¢.</li>
<li>Built-in hint system.</li>
<li>Native Linux version works great on the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Touch controls allowing the web version to be played on phones and tablets.</li>
<li>1-2 hours of playtime.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Better ASUS ROG Ally X support on Linux is coming with a big kernel patch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you were hoping to see better ASUS ROG Ally X support on Linux, you're in for a treat here, as there's a big patch that's been sent in.</p>
<p>Developer Luke D. Jones notified us today about their ongoing work, and the latest big patch is available for review. As Jones said in the patch: "This driver adds full support of the ASUS ROG Ally X gamepad and support for the Ally 1 xpad configuration options.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19434951041722937642gol1.png"/></p>
<p>What the patch includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- dinput is translated to XBox controller (Ally-X only)<br/>
- default mode has the QAM buttons mapped (Ally-X only)<br/>
* left is XBox button<br/>
* right is an XBox + A combo for steam QAM<br/>
- force feedback is supported (Ally-X only)<br/>
- LED brightness control (0-3)<br/>
- LED multicolor class support<br/>
- Support all configuration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the configuration options available with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Gamepad mode (game, wasd, mouse)<br/>
- Remapping each button, plus macro map (hold macro btn and press other)<br/>
- Joystrick and trigger deadzones<br/>
- Gamepad vibration intensity<br/>
- Leds (using multicolor class)<br/>
- Button turbo abilities (per button)<br/>
- Joystick repsonse curves<br/>
- Joystick anti-deadzones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more info <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-input/20240806081212.56860-1-luke@ljones.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out the patch</a>. Hopefully it doesn't need too many adjustments before it can be pulled in so we can see better upstream support on Linux for the ASUS ROG Ally X.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jones let us know they've also been <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/20240806020747.365042-1-luke@ljones.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">working on</a> a new "armoury" driver for ASUS ROG laptops aimed at making various bios/fw settings easier to use.</p>

      <title>Chocolate Doom 3.1.0 brings many new features for the classic source port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other source ports are pretty popular like GZDoom, Chocolate Doom continues getting better to retain the best compatibility with the original DOS versions of Doom, Doom II, Heretic, Hexen and Strife. It's been quite a few years too, with the last main release of Chocolate Doom being back in 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10678958031722936866gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the new features included in Chocolate Doom v3.1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>WAD file autoloading was added - WAD and DEH files can be copied into an autoload folder to be automatically included on every game start.</li>
<li>MP3 music packs are now supported.</li>
<li>Network synchronization now uses a PID controller by default, which makes games more smooth and more stable, especially for Internet play.</li>
<li>UDP hole punching is now used to make servers behind NAT gateways.<br/>
automatically accessible to the Internet.</li>
<li>The IWAD files installed by Steam on Linux are now detected.</li>
<li>The Freedoom single-player IWAD files are now officially supported, since recent versions changed all levels to be vanilla compatible.</li>
<li>Add improved gamepad support via the SDL_GameController interface. This includes support for analog triggers, modern dual-stick default bindings (based on Unity Doom), descriptive button names for common controller types and configurable dead zones for stick axes.</li>
<li>Doom 1.2 demo support was added.</li>
<li>+ lots and lots more.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Manjaro Linux gets an Immutable version available for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Manjaro Linux team have announced the first round of testing for their new Manjaro Immutable version of the popular Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It's built using <a href="https://github.com/arkanelinux/arkdep" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkdep</a> which is a "Toolkit for building, deploying and maintaining an immutable, atomic, btrfs-based system". Along with also using <a href="https://arkanelinux.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkane Linux</a> a "opinionated, immutable, atomic Arch-based distibution".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2419030641722936205gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this release is to gather community feedback on the technology powering Manjaro Immutable.</p>
<p>Note that this is only an experimental release and not representative of the final version, there is also no support guarantee, so hold off on installing it as your primary operating system, at least for now.</p>
<cite>Manjaro Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>It's probable this is what they're using as the basis for Manjaro Gaming Edition, which is what will be shipping on their upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/manjaro-linux-devs-show-off-the-orangepi-neo-prototype-handheld-with-gameplay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld</a>. In fact, Manjaro's own Philip MÃ¼ller commented to <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-immutable-out-now-for-community-testing/166364/25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mention</a> how it's "useful if you have devices like a gaming handheld or a business which wants to ease the maintenance efforts of their employees".</p>
<p>Another developer also <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-immutable-out-now-for-community-testing/166364/40" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> this is <em>not</em> intended to replace the standard Manjaro.</p>
<p>Anyone brave enough to give it a spin can see more details in <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-immutable-out-now-for-community-testing/166364" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 42: Upset the Applecart</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-41-the-worm-turns/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 41: The Worm Turns</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>While the studio's destiny would later see it become consumed by Microsoft, in its earliest days Bungie instead stayed a Mac focused development house, whose <em>Marathon</em> games were for a time kept exclusive to that platform. Starting with the release of <em>Myth: The Fallen Lords</em> in 1997 they switched to cross-platform development, which soon caught the attention of a fledgling Loki Software. With the sequel, Bungie would again cater to an underrepresented video game market.</p>
<p><em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em> is set sixty years after the events of the original game, and while the plot can be said to be standalone, the lore makes heavy allusions back to the first game. One of the issues of the porting model is that you often only get fragments of a larger series, and I think my appreciation here did suffer from this. <em>Myth</em> also gets touted as being an RTS without the tedious resource gathering and base building, but I have always found combat micromanagement to be the least engaging aspect.</p>
<p>Along with its exclusive focus on commanding a pre-defined arrangement of troops into battle, the <em>Myth</em> series also innovated by being a very early example of a 3D real-time strategy title. <em>Myth II</em> in particular iterated on this by emphasizing the effects of weather and environmental conditions on combat, with fire and explosives being doused by water and higher elevations giving archers greater advantage when shooting arrows. Ranged units also seem especially prone to friendly fire.</p>
<p>Other games had taught me to keep my melee fighters in front to soak up and block attacks, but in <em>Myth II</em> this will prevent your archers and dwarves from making their shots, with them often firing into your own ranks. Instead, you need to keep your melee combatants out of the direct line of fire but still nearby, in order to mob the enemy as soon as they close the distance. Keeping a good handle on your dwarves in particular is half the battle, as they do not discriminate when hurling their bombs.</p>
<p>You get tasked with babysitting the AI, which feeds into the game as a whole feeling kind of contrived. The maps while detailed are kept small due to the demands of the 3D engine, and your objectives are static and rigid, causing me to chafe at how stage managed the game can be. I can see why people do love <em>Myth II</em>, as its narrow focus and tight encounter design does offer the potential for someone to attain total mastery, but for me I have to admit it felt a chore playing it through to the end.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1302424911722882898gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1302424911722882898gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19004533261722882900gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19004533261722882900gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>On a technical level the Linux port by Loki both installed and ran well for me, but 3D acceleration was always a sticking point. <em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em> was developed with 3dfx Glide in mind, and out of the box that is the only 3D API that the game supports outside of software rendering. OpenGL support was included in a later patch, still available through the Loki Update tool, but on my hardware and with my drivers I actually found that the software renderer looked and performed better.</p>
<p>Later patches also provide support for <em>Myth II: Chimera</em>, an eight level expansion developed by fans with the participation of Bungie. To get this to work I used the chimera-1.0.run installer which will add the new levels to the mission selection screen, which are of a high quality only let down by some amateurish presentation; the new voice acting is flat when compared to the excellent narration of the base game, but even there, some of the more incidental voices could still be rather silly.</p>
<p>The greatest flourish in <em>Myth II</em> are the animated cutscenes, a nice little time capsule of a style of adult animation that has since fallen out of favour, reminding me of shows like the contemporary <em>Spawn</em> animated series of the time. Another fine touch is the game allowing you to record demos of your battles in order to play them back again later, even if it does further emphasize the preformative nature of the scenarios. If you really want to show off your perfect run, this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>These demos can even be ran easily on newer computers thanks to Project Magma, another fan effort similar to the OldUnreal project that maintains a modern branch of the <em>Myth II</em> engine with the full blessing of Bungie. The graphical installer provided on the Project Magma website will read the data off either a Linux or a Windows and Mac CD-ROM of the game, both of which are still easy to find second hand even today; only the Linux version of <em>Quake III Arena</em> shows up more often on eBay.</p>
<p>It also offers a great option for those who still want to engage with <em>Myth II</em> multiplayer, a feature very much advertised on the box that I may want to try myself now that I have gotten a handle on the mechanics. I enjoyed using the The Deceiver's magic to convert the dark forces over to my side, so being able to play as them in multiplayer might make for a refreshing change. But for now, I might just outdo myself by covering perhaps the most obscure Linux developer I have written about to date.</p>

      <title>FNA gets Direct3D 11 support on Linux thanks to DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Ethan Lee yesterday announced the release of FNA 24.08, bringing with it preparation for the upcoming release of SDL 3 and a fun addition of Direct3D 11 support on Linux thanks to DXVK.</p>
<p>What is FNA? It's a reimplementation of the Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh libraries. Quite a lot of games use it since it's open source and cross-platform. Games using it includes the likes of Streets of Rage 4, Terraria, Unrailed!, Axiom Verge 1 &amp; 2 and the list <a href="http://www.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Tools#01_FNA.txt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">goes on</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/fna-direct3d-11-support-on-linux-using-dxvk-and-vkd3d/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FNA release 23.05</a> from last year pulled in the early initial Alpha of Direct3D 11 support on Linux, with FNA 24.08 now making it properly official. The DXVK project itself merged in the DXVK-Native code way back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0 at the end of 2022</a>. What's the point of it? Even easier game porting, with it translating Microsoft's D3D API to Vulkan for Native Linux games.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release, Lee said in the FNA <a href="https://discord.gg/fna-xna" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big surprise, it's another release that's mostly SDL3 prep and not much else. But don't be fooled, this month was huge for FNA - for SDL 3.0 the maintainers have decided to go with our GPU API, and we've even been cleared to try and get it into the first release! We've been focused entirely on GPU since then, and progress continues - we're hoping to have the API in Beta very very soon, barring any oddities from D3D12.</p>
<p>At the same time, FNA's D3D11 support on Linux is now officially complete and supported! Steam developers are encouraged to request the "Sniper" runtime for their native Linux versions, so users can enable DXVK support if they'd like. I expect our GPU API to be just as good at least, but it's a nice thing to have in the meantime.</p>
<p>It's been a graphics-heavy summer for sure, with way more crunch than any of us would have liked, but the results will definitely be worth it!</p>

      <title>Glorious retro FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; is now Steam Deck Verified and plans many huge gameplay upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As far as retro-styled shooters go, Selaco is probably <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of the best I've ever played</a>. With chunky visuals, fun combat and some really nice level design. Now, it's Steam Deck Verified and we have a better idea of what's to come next.</p>
<p>Valve has now given it the glorious green <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified tick of approval, with their Native Linux version as of July 31st. So you can now hopefully be sure that you can take it on the go, and carry on with it on your desktop whenever you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514387681722602422gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514387681722602422gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for what's to come next? They have pretty exciting plans, although they're not going to give us any dates on when to expect them. Posted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4374768959778727710" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer update</a> on Steam here's some of what's coming in the <em>next </em>update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Backpack Reloading - This was a frequently requested feature. This is a system where, after not equipping a weapon for a while, the weapon will be automatically reloaded with a full magazine (provided there is enough ammo for it). This ensures that players will always swap to a loaded weapon in the middle of combat. This system is optional and can be disabled.</li>
<li>Improved Immersion &amp; Interactivity - The next update adds brand new visual and audio effects, improves rain to look more atmospheric, adds new interactables and more. If you like a world that feels believable and reactive, you will love some of these changes.</li>
<li>Weapon Rebalancing - Another round of weapon balancing! This also includes making automatic weapons more consistent with their damage output. The current version on Steam has an oversight where there is a solid chance to roll low damage numbers consecutively, making some automatic weapons feel weaker than they are meant to be.</li>
<li>Stagger improvements - Currently, enemies are less likely to stagger the higher your difficulty is. This ended up being a bad idea because it makes certain weapons lose their usefulness. The next update will address this and compensate with something more reasonable.</li>
<li>Another round of performance improvements - A large amount of code is being optimized to reduce the amount of strain on your hardware, resulting in smoother frames and less hiccups.</li>
<li>A slew of other Quality of Life Improvements - Vastly improved Grenade Throwing, new Map Icons, a DMR that respects your Hold/Toggle setting and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more than that, although the below content is likely to be a fair bit later. They're only a small team, and the game has a lot in it already, so they do have plenty of time to get this right. Still, I can't help but be excited by plenty of their future plans that include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Story Content - This is the big one. Selaco will get a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot. We unfortunately ran out of time to do this at launch, which made certain parts of the game feel more empty than we'd like. <em>This is planned to arrive around the end of the year.</em></li>
<li>Randomizer Mode - Another big feature is the Randomizer Mode. This aims to add tons of replayability to the game. It randomizes enemy spawns, introduces a Rarity System where some weapons and enemies are more powerful than usual, repositions ammo pickups and offers tons of customization to tweak the game to your liking.<em> This mode is planned to launch alongside the Story Content update.</em></li>
<li>Improved enemy tacticsI - Better Patrol modes, a goal system, cover system and more are planned for our AI. These will take a while, though, and may not appear until Chapter 2. Please bear with us as we give them an additional boost in intelligence!</li>
<li>Adjustable difficulty during the campaign - We are looking into a system that allows players to drop the difficulty at any time during a campaign playthrough. We wanted to add this earlier, but it was quite a complicated problem to tackle and will need a bit more time.</li>
<li>Customizable Mutators - We are working on a system that allows players to customize individual mutators before starting a new campaign. For example, tweak Hard-Boiled Mode to disable the additional projectile speed for the enemy, or play Hardcore Mode but with standard Weapon Reload behavior. <em>Mutators that have been customized will show an apostrophe symbol at the Chapter Completion Screen</em></li>
<li>Improved Safe Rooms - We are working on additional features to make Safe Rooms more interesting and useful. This includes a free one-time use Health Cache where players can refill their health, and an Armor Station where players can purchase armor. However, the latter might not appear until Chapter 2.</li>
<li>Chapter 2 is coming along nicely - Chapter 2 introduces a large amount of new systems which we will talk about in a blog post closer to its launch.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Intel to lay off around 15,000 staff as they try make $10 billion in savings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not just the gaming industry that likes to get fat and then fire everyone, as Intel has announced a cost-cutting exercise where they will be letting go of around 15,000 staff.</p>
<p>Announced as part of their Q2 2024 <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1704/intel-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results</a>, followed up by <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/actions-accelerate-our-progress.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a note</a> from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, the reduction in staff is to be completed by the end of the year. No matter how you want to spin it, 15,000 is a ridiculous amount of people overall for a single company to just get rid of.</p>
<p>Gelsinger mentioned how it's "an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our companyâs history". Words that will likely fall on deaf ears for those being told their time is up. Why though? According to Gelsinger, Intel's revenue has " not grown as expected â and weâve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI".</p>
<p>Their results show they've seen revenue of $12.8 billion in Q2, which is down 1% year over year. Gelsinger notes for example how in 2020 annual revenue was "$24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now".</p>
<p>How long before the AI bubble really bursts? Or perhaps stuff like this is the beginning. </p>
<p><em>Intel's shares have fallen about 23% at time of writing.</em></p>

      <title>The free game Infinitode 2 - Infinite Tower Defense added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun surprise for you today, Infinitode 2 - Infinite Tower Defense is a free to play game that just added Native Linux support on July 30th.</p>
<p>If you've ever played a TD game, you'll know what to expect. Pick a level, place down towers and watch as they destroy various types of enemies that try to make their way towards your base. There's a few fun things that makes this one different though including a big 400+ research list that looks like something out of Path of Exile. There's quite a lot of varied maps, along with a map editor that has live leaderboards on each level along with various boss fights. Add to that the wonderful chiptune music, the many different types of towers with per-tower upgrades and individual tower levels for special bonuses, various gameplay modifiers, mining for resources and much more.</p>
<p>The trailer is pretty old but still gives you a good idea of what to expect:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g0eQsxUjoDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/35d935a725c0f9111e66a768579a8493.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g0eQsxUjoDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I only clicked Play on this one to check if the Linux version actually worked properly since it's brand new, and ended up sinking quite a bit of time into it. No issues encountered at all and seems like a lot of fun to put some hours into. So I'm not surprised to see it has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/937310/Infinitode_2__Infinite_Tower_Defense/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free to play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>We&#39;ll get our first look at Civilization VII on August 20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K have announced that Civilization VII will get a world premiere of gameplay shown off during Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>On August 20th at 11 AM PT / 6 PM UTC it will begin on the Gamescom <a href="http://twitch.tv/gamescom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a>, and later afterwards at 1:30PM PT / 8:30PM UTC there will also be a Civilization VII Gameplay Showcase direct from developer Firaxes on their own <a href="http://twitch.tv/Firaxisgames" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a> channel. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For more than 20 minutes, we'll be sharing exclusive insights from the development team about this revolutionary new chapter in the franchise, including our vision for the game as well as its innovative new features. For a one-stop shop on everything <em>Civilization VII</em>, you'll definitely want to catch this one live!</p>
<p>But thatâs just the start! From August 21 to 25, attendees at Gamescom should be sure to stop by the <em>Civilization VII</em> booth located in Hall 6.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll be heading over to PAX West in Seattle and hope to see you there! On August 31, Kinda Funny Games' Greg Miller will host our developer panel, where we'll share new insights and behind-the-scenes anecdotes from the creation of <em>Civilization VII</em>. For those attending in-person, we'll be located in the Main Theater on the 5th floor of the Summit Building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The press release didn't go into any other detail, and gave little away to the imagination other than the basic details.</p>
<p>What are you hoping to see in Civilization VII? As noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the original announcement I covered</a>, they do plan to offer Native Linux support once again for this game.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 46-1 released fixing up some AMD issues, sound fix on some AYANEO &amp; AYN devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/chimeraos-46-brings-major-upgrades-and-enhanced-handheld-support-for-gpd-ayaneo-onexplayer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big release of ChimeraOS 46 recently</a> that further expanded the gaming handheld support with this Linux distribution, ChimeraOS 46-1 is out now to clean up some issues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some users discovered a black screen problem across AMD RX 400/500 GPUs, which this release fixes. You will need to run a manual update to get around it as detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Release-Notes#chimeraos-46-1-2024-08-01" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>The main changes for this release are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Restores support for AMD RX 400/500 series GPUs with a workaround for gamescope (Thank you to the Bazzite team).</li>
<li>Reverted Aya Neo 2/2S to use full resolution by default.</li>
<li>A fix for automatic recovery when the filesystem is corrupted.</li>
<li>Fix sound on some AYN and AYANEO devices broken by v46.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You have a few good choices to run Linux on handhelds now, and it's great to see! Generally a much better overall experience compared to how much of a nuisance Windows is on a small screen. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/bazzite-linux-36-out-now-bringing-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> is another good option that also recently had a big update!</p>
<p><em>What's your preferred choice for handheld gaming?</em></p>

      <title>Fox-girl platformer Kitsune Tails is a true quality retro-inspired good time - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitsune Tails from developer Kitsune Games is a platformer inspired by the classics like Super Mario Bros, steeped in Japanese mythology and it's well worth playing. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>You play as Yuzu, a Kitsune (fox-lady), and it starts off very much like your traditional platformer. However, it has a whole lot of tricks and game mechanics that will just keep you playing and leave you wanting for more.</p>
<p>For starters, the voice acting, it's especially good. It actually reminds me of Anime-styled voices, which I mean in the nicest possible way as a big Anime fan. The characters sound exactly as I would expect them to and really does add nicely to the experience. With cut-scenes between certain levels and areas, it really helps to make the game feel like this grand adventure, it just feelsâ¦so much larger than a lot of other platformers I've played with a story that guides you through friendship, love, jealousy and quickly leads to betrayal.</p>
<p>Like Mario, you get a sort-of life system. Initially you start as a Kitsune (the humanoid form), but if you get hit once you will then be turned into a small fox but you can break special squares to grab an orb to turn back into the full Kitsune mode. Some areas actually need you to be the little fox too, so you can squeeze into some gaps and so if you want to collect everything sometimes it just pays to get hit.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jfhhm0DuJYs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb731b184f79b47a6a13404ae837f43f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jfhhm0DuJYs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Fun creature design too like Armadillo looking things you can hit once to curl them into a ball, then give a little kick to launch them across the map, which is useful for knocking a few other creatures out of your way. However, they bounce between walls quite quickly so it might bounce back at you - ouch!</p>
<p>The creatures are designed quite carefully too, so you generally know at a glance whatâs safe to jump onto to squish and what isnât. Are they spiky or on fire? Yeah, best not to touch, theyâre not friend shaped. Funny interactions with some of them on how you take them down too. Heck, there's even a little Boss Fight styled flair from early Sonic games in there too which really came as a surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5953275261722533376gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5953275261722533376gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of fun game mechanics to suck you in here. I especially enjoyed the ghost levels early on. If you get close they get angry and chase you across the level, but light lets you pass through them. So stay within the light, or in some cases you need to hold a button to pick up a light to run with it. Some levels require the light (or an enemy emitting a light) to show up something in the level you need, so you don't always squish enemies right away. Lots and lots of little features to make you really appreciate the design of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11129422951722533022gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11129422951722533022gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>A nice difficulty system too. While the classics have you repeat a whole level when you die, thatâs only the middle difficulty here. With the easier option being to let you respawn back in place on a little cloud so you get a short amount of movement to freely place yourself. A perfect touch for those who want a more leisurely pace if needed. You can change that difficulty at any time too, which I will admit 1 or 2 sections (okay maybe 3 or 4) gave me retro-platformer rage after falling to my death or mistiming something for the 100th time. Just having that option to go back to where I was on some difficult bits really helped me personally enjoy it. Although I did find a bug or two with the cloud respawn system, since itâs time limited thereâs a few spots to fall where it doesnât quite bring you back high enough in the level so you have to repeat it anyway.</p>
<p>There's a really good amount of level content here, so you'll be able to get your monies worth for sure. You get access to a shop too quite early on, so you then have an actual point to try and collect all the coins possible in each level, as some of the power-ups can really change how you smash through a level.</p>
<p>When you get further into the game with the elemental power-up system, it really begins to truly shine and becomes much more than just a throwback to Mario which it does feel just a tad too much like initially but soon comes into its own.</p>
<p>Sweet queer story too. Which for a retro platformer, really is far more fleshed-out and in-depth than I expected, and one that I don't want to spoil too much, but let's just say your pure innocence causes a bit of storm for everyone.</p>
<p>What they've done with it is quite ridiculous too, their custom game engine comes right out of the gate with modding support where you can make your own maps and mini-games with Lua and the Tiled editor. There's a few mini-games included like a first-person maze-crawling experience or a Boulder Dash-like game too. I can't wait to see what people come up with.</p>

      <title>Real-time air traffic controller sim Mini Airways is out now and will keep you on your toes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What I initially thought would be a bit like Mini Motorways and Mini Metro, it's similar only really in style and name, but Mini Airways is a different and challenging beast that will keep your undivided attention. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Cheekily pinching the naming style from Dinosaur Polo Club, CCC Games and Erabit have crafted something truly quite interesting here. You're an air traffic controller, directing planes around each map. Starting off nice and slow, the complexity builds up carefully but quite quickly to really pull your interest in.</p>
<p>While the presentation is very much like Motorways and Metro, here you have more direct-control. Instead of placing lines constantly between points, you're clicking and dragging aeroplanes to a specific angle, or towards a specific point and hoping you don't cause your name to enter newspapers as the worst air traffic controller in history as you smash planes together like a child's toy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8489958161722521973gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8489958161722521973gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once you've directed a plane to a landing site, you'll then need to place it down again from the bottom bar onto the runway to get it to take off again. This is where you then direct it to the correct coloured point. As you progress on a map it will gradually zoom out, revealing more coloured points to direct taking off planes towards, and it will continually throw more planes to deal with at you.</p>
<p>This does get a little complicated when you've got numerous planes flying towards points, wanting to land and take off. You've got to get a lot of timing right, but there's plenty of space left for errors and being able to quickly click and drag to divert any plane in any direction makes it pretty darn easy to do so. The interface and tutorial are wonderfully clear on all the controls.</p>
<p>Part of what makes it tricky is getting the angle of planes lined up. You can't just click a plane halfway across the map to a runway, because they may not have the angle needed from that position, so you need to get them closer where they can swing around. Keeping in mind you'll have a bunch of other planes flying around too, often being in each others way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2116429701722522324gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2116429701722522324gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, you do get some upgrades to help you deal with the air traffic. It all depends on what you feel you need at the time.</p>
<p>More situations will appear that you need to deal with, like failed landings, so even when you think you've got things ticking-over nicely, you might suddenly have to deal with a plane you thought you had already dealt with and get it to swing back around for another attempt. When you've already got a bunch lined up to land, this will require you to think again and quickly too. It will constantly keep your attention.</p>
<p>Each map provides its own slightly different test too from multiple runways, to mountains and more. Add to that the random events you can get, there's a really nice challenge to it. Overall I think this is a game that's well worth picking up that you can play for hours on end.</p>
<p>With the custom maps and modding support too, no doubt it will have some fun stuff made for it.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter has launched and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like Aspyr Media actually did a pretty good job on this one, with STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter now available on GOG and Steam.</p>
<p>Early reports from Steam reviews are giving it a Very Positive rating, a pretty stark comparison to the mess that was STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection at launch which is still at Mostly Negative on Steam. Nice to see a remaster like this hit the mark.</p>
<p>"Become the most feared Bounty Hunter in the galaxy! As Jango Fett, youâll have to jump, jetpack, climb, and maneuver in this iconic action-adventure game featuring a variety of visual improvements on modern platforms, as well as Steam Deck support and a number of DualSense controller features for PlayStation 5 players.</p>
<p>And for the first time ever, if the campaign is completed, players can unlock a new Boba Fett skin for their next playthrough, paying off a notorious easter egg from the original game!"</p>

<p>It's Steam Deck Verified with Proton 9. So you'll be good to go on Desktop Linux with Proton 9 as well.</p>

      <title>Stop Destroying Videogames petition heads to the European Union</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in April 2024, I wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/stop-killing-games-is-a-new-campaign-to-stop-developers-making-games-unplayable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Stop Killing Games initiative</a> from Ross at Accursed Farms. Now, it's heading to the European Union with a European Citizens' Initiative you can give you vote to. Sorry fellow Brits, but thanks to Brexit we can't get involved in this. If you're part of the European Union though, you can now truly try and make your voice count.</p>
<p>As a reminder on what it's all about from the ECI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This initiative calls to require publishers that sell or license videogames to consumers in the European Union (or related features and assets sold for videogames they operate) to leave said videogames in a functional (playable) state.</p>
<p>Specifically, the initiative seeks to prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.</p>
<p>The initiative does not seek to acquire ownership of said videogames, associated intellectual rights or monetization rights, neither does it expect the publisher to provide resources for the said videogame once they discontinue it while leaving it in a reasonably functional (playable) state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a worthy cause, because some publishers do have a habit of shutting down games when they move on, leaving players with nothing to show for it even though they paid for it. Games that contain a single-player element especially <em>should</em> always have an option to let you continue on. It's a bit more complicated for online-only games, say for those that have micro-transactions and battle passes, but still you're often spending a whole lot of your money to be again left with nothing.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the initiative and give your vote</a>. See more on the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games website</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux hits another all-time high for July 2024 according to Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some more good news for you as according to statistics website Statcounter, Linux use hit another all-time high in July 2024. We've seen it slowly creep up over time, just like we've seen on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Survey</a> as well.</p>
<p>For July 2024, they're showing Linux at 4.45% which is the highest they've ever had it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's how things have looked over the last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>July 23 - 3.12%</li>
<li>August 23 - 3.18%</li>
<li>September 23 - 3.02%</li>
<li>October 23 - 2.92%</li>
<li>November 23 - 3.22%</li>
<li>December 23 - 3.82%</li>
<li>January 24 - 3.77%</li>
<li>February 24 - 4.03%</li>
<li>March 24 - 4.05%</li>
<li>April - 3.88%</li>
<li>May - 3.77%</li>
<li>June - 4.05%</li>
<li><strong>July - 4.45%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Since 2009:</p>

<p>Is this where we truly get to say it's the year of Linux on the desktop? Not quite. It's only one measurement, and it comes with the usual pinch of salt based on how they pull their data which they say is from "more than 1.5 million sites globally". Still, it's an interesting way to track it and it's still great news. </p>

      <title>Temtem: Swarm developers highlight their work on Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Temtem: Swarm, the spin-off from Crema and GGTech Studios from the original online creature-collector Temtem, seems like it's going to have great Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>This time around, the developers are jumping into the ever-increasing survivor-like genre made popular by Vampire Survivors with their own unique spin on it. They've taken the simple classic survivor gameplay but added in their strategy-based combat mechanics where you and up to 3 others can play together online alongside creatures from the Temtem universe.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2510960/view/4355628027405250446" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam today the developers highlighted their work to ensure it works well: "Our clever little monkeys have been working tirelessly to make sure the game feels great in your hands. The game's interface scales beautifully to the Deck's screen, so you can keep track of your Temtem squad and the incoming enemy hordes with ease. And of course, full controller support lets you unleash your inner swarm-battling master without ever needing to touch a keyboard."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10201465331722433312gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10201465331722433312gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since there's going to be a lot going on, they needed to make sure the game performed well and in some cases it didn't. So they went into a bit of detail on how they've been making sure that it does:</p>
<p>"You might be asking yourself how we got hundreds of detailed Temtem models to show on the screen without making the system crash and burn. For that we relied on the amazing TechArt and Programming teams to find ways to make the magic happen.</p>
<p>Normally, Temtem are animated using skeletons, but with so many animated characters on screen at once this can really slow things down. So, we used a special technique to bake animations into textures which allowed us to have the graphics card (GPU) handle those animations. This frees up the processor (CPU) for other tasks, like enemy behavior and executing your attacks, dashes, and movements.</p>
<p>The VFX teams were also responsible for making a ton of beautiful animations with eye-catching particle effects for the pick-up items. There can be a lot of those items on the screen at once - especially after Platypetâs Tsunami goes off! Those animations and particles were being handled by the CPU, but using a similar technique, they made it so that the process could be handled by the GPU instead.</p>
<p>On the programming side of things, we noticed the game was chugging a bit when players were going wild at the same time, especially when the host of a co-op game was on the Steam Deck. Turns out, one of the plugins we were using wasn't built for such chaotic fun! The team cooked up some special tweaks just for the Steam Deck, and voila! The game runs like a dream, even with a whole crew of players causing mayhem.</p>
<p>All of this means that the swarm can be larger, drop more items, and chase you harder all while the Steam Deck runs like a dream. We have even more we can optimize, so weâll keep pushing to have the best experience possible!"</p>
<p>Even as a non-developer, I definitely enjoy seeing game developers note down specifically what they're doing, it makes for a fun read. And, testing performance against the Steam Deck is just a great idea, because it gives you a decent target to optimise for that then benefits all players.</p>
<p>There's currently no release date other than Q4 2024, and they said in the post it's a few months away still. Check out the previous trailer:</p>

<p>More about the developer: Founded in Bristol, UK in 2016 by illustrator Louis Durrant, carrotcake previously developed the beautiful European fable Crossing to the Cold Valley, and Kingdom Ka, an abstract retelling of the worldâs oldest stories, prior to their work on The Garden Path. Durrant is a one-person development team, whose primary goal is to build spaces that people want to exist in. With The Garden Path, that mantra can be seen in every facet of the game. Growing up watching the Moomins and Studio Ghibli films, Durrant credits both works as inspirations for The Garden Path.</p>
<p>There were some initial Steam Deck issues for this one, but the developer has already done a couple of quick patches so it should be okay now.</p>
<p>You can buy it with Native Linux support from <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1638500/The_Garden_Path/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Core Ultra Lunar Lake launches September 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Intel are currently battling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issues</a> with their crashing 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, they're now planning to launch Intel Core Ultra Lunar Lake in September.</p>
<p>In a short press release Intel said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahead of the IFA 2024 conference, join Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group, and Jim Johnson, senior vice president and general manager of the Client Business Group, and Intel partners as they launch the next generation of IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ Ultra processors, code-named Lunar Lake.</p>
<p>During the livestreamed event, they will reveal details on the new processorsâ breakthrough x86 power efficiency, exceptional core performance, massive leaps in graphics performance and the unmatched AI computing power that will drive this and future generations of Intel products.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sept. 3 at 6 p.m. CEST (9 a.m. PDT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm especially interested to see how the new Xe2 GPU performs, we're really getting to a golden age of machines that don't really need a big fat dedicated GPU to run a huge amount of games. Just look at the Steam Deck and what it achieved. And as always, the industry moves quickly and we're about to get another interesting boost. See more<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/intel-revealed-more-lunar-lake-processor-details-with-their-new-xe2-graphics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Lunar Lake details in my previous article</a>.</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Megapicker has been corrupting some Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of an oops here with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/grab-a-free-copy-of-drawful-2-now-that-the-jackbox-megapicker-is-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly released The Jackbox Megapicker</a>, with the Native Linux version causing the Steam Deck to get corrupted.</p>
<p>There were reports floating around in places like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1efm0fp/the_jackbox_megapicker_might_have_seriously/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, with people discussing it in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Discord</a> as well. This has caused the Jackbox team to now post on their Steam forum <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2828500/discussions/0/4513254562066220587/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weâre so excited to have The Jackbox Megapicker out in the world for our fans to enjoy. Unfortunately at this time, weâve seen a handful of reports come in regarding issues with the Megapicker on Steam Decks.</p>
<p>Our engineering and QA teams are working hard to resolve this issue, and hope to get everyone back to gaming in no time.</p>
<p>However, it is our current recommendation that Steam Deck users refrain from downloading The Jackbox Megapicker until further notice. We hope to be able to resolve this issue ASAP.</p>
<p>If you are currently having issues with The Jackbox Megapicker on Steam Deck, please reach out to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.jackboxgames.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://support.jackboxgames.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais has also <a href="https://x.com/Plagman2/status/1818574815412076947" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (Twitter) to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hotfix has been issued to select Proton by default for the Jackbox Megapicker until the issues with corrupting the Steam installation are addressed. To avoid issues, don't override the compatibility selection to the Linux Runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite a big problem that a single game could cause your Steam Deck to be unusable without re-doing the whole SteamOS install. Hopefully Valve will be looking into how this was ever possible, to get the Steam Client and SteamOS to be protected against such issues in future.</p>

      <title>Steam will now show you who is playing on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Steam Client Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck, Valve will actually show you who is gaming on a Steam Deck. A small cosmetic change, but a fun one for Steam Deck fans.</p>
<p>This is only for the Beta (and Preview on Steam Deck too) currently, that will eventually roll out for everyone into a stable update.</p>
<p>From the Desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4329732963499546524" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The friends list will now show a Steam Deck icon, instead of a gamepad icon, if the other user is playing on a Steam Deck</li>
<li>Replaced the friends list VR icon with a new graphic that also matches the in-game or online friend state color</li>
<li>Fixed a few spots where tooltips were causing unexpected word wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recordings &amp; Screenshots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed error that could happen when opening the Recordings &amp; Screenshots dialog before necessary data had loaded in</li>
<li>Improved search filter behavior in the game selector dropdown in the Recordings &amp; Screenshots dialog</li>
<li>Added support for "Send to Phone" share option to screenshots</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From my own friend list for example, spot the one currently on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13864361971722428585gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And then these below are specifically from the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4361258160890095013" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Game Recording Beta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed instances of failing to capture video data after multiple game launches.</li>
<li>Fixed cropped video capture when an external display is connected or disconnected after startup.</li>

      <title>Enshrouded gets AMD FSR 3 and Steam Deck stability and performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Might be time to jump back into Enshrouded, as it should run better than ever no matter what system you're on, but especially Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>The Enshrouded: Back to the Shroud update landed yesterday bringing with it the headline feature of difficulty presets, so you can tweak the experience you want to your liking. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4361257526928448831" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lots more</a> tweaks and changes but crucially, performance <em>should</em> be quite a bit improved. Something that was needed, as it many cases it was quite bad.</p>
<p>In the changelog they noted improved "stability and performance on lower hardware specs and on the Steam Deck", there's an updated default settings for Steam Deck as well and they've added in AMD FSR 3 now too. The crafting menu also has larger preview images, so it should look better on smaller screens now too.</p>
<p>Other than that there's plenty of new additions to the world, new character customization options and lots more. Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Grab a free copy of Drawful 2 now that The Jackbox Megapicker is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Jackbox Megapicker</a> is a launcher to bring together the many party games that Jackbox Games, Inc. have created to help get your party started. It's out now, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/442070/Drawful_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drawful 2</a> is free until August 28th.</p>
<p>So even if you don't currently own any Jackbox party games, you can at least put Drawful 2 in the bag. The Jackbox Megapicker is free as well, because it's just a fancy launcher to get you into games easier across their <em>many</em> packs and get you to hopefully buy some more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10988524981722350678gol1.jpg"/><br/>
Pictured - The Jackbox Megapicker</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jackbox Megapicker is your all-in-one solution for organizing, buying, and launching all of your Jackbox games. You no longer have to switch between Party Packs to start playing your favorite games. The Megapicker will give you an overview of the games that you own so you can launch them directly. View games you might be missing, and see news updates and ongoing sales all in one place. Filter your games by genre and create an account to store your preferences and see your game history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To go along with it they're also running a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/jackboxfranchisesale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Franchise Sale</a> on Steam so you can pick up some of their games and packs for quite a lot cheaper.</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play app gets renamed to chiaki-ng (chiaki-next-generation)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What was originally called chiaki4deck, a lot of people thought it was primarily aimed at PlayStation Remote Play for Steam Deck but they've now rebranded to chiaki-ng (chiaki-next-generation).</p>
<p>This is because it's a fork of the original chiaki, which is no longer maintained and this version is far ahead of it. So this change is to better align that the project is actually designed to support PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 Remote Play for Linux (and Steam Deck of course), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Android, macOS, Windows and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub URL</a> has changed, and so has the <a href="https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki-ng/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website documentation</a>. And they have a fancy new logo too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1552405641722350872gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A couple of releases have also been made since I last wrote about it including this rebrand release (v1.8) which also noted this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes current profile when using --profile option.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also 1.7.4 from last week which noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>adds notification when psn creds expire.</li>
<li>use IPv4 for hostnames as ps4/5 don't support using IPv6 for remote play.</li>
<li>allow entering pin using enter key as alternative to selecting ok.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Alien: Rogue Incursion (VR) looks like it will turn me into a nervous wreck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm looking forward to playing through another proper single-player VR game, and it looks like Alien: Rogue Incursion may be my next big one. That is, as long as SteamVR with the Valve Index on Linux is in a good enough state to run it when it releases late this year.</p>
<p>A new trailer went live showcasing the protagonist and some actual gameplay too check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="49WAFl7u6gA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f09e28d7ffd07eb59cacbfe167b551ec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/49WAFl7u6gA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Having to pull up the motion scanner is absolutely going to wreck my heart. I'm not <em>entirely</em> sold on the visuals just yet, but in VR it's a whole different feeling and it's still in development so hopefully they will keep improving on that.</p>
<p>They said it will be available "this Holiday" so likely sometime in December.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE ALIEN UNIVERSE</strong><br/>
Experience the horror and challenge of fighting Xenomorphs in a world inspired by the look and feel of the Alien film franchise. Audio, Visuals, Lighting, FX, Interaction, and Haptics work together to plunge players into the terrifying world of Alien.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE</strong><br/>
Xenomorphs can intelligently use the environment to find the best angle of attack and appear from anywhere around you. Playing in VR will test your nerves and skill as you feel the pulse-pounding terror of facing off against Xenomorphs. In addition to weapons and gear, your resourcefulness, quick reflexes, and ability to stay cool under terrifying pressure is needed to survive.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>MISTAKES ARE DEADLY</strong><br/>
Combat is dynamic and can happen (or not) based on Player actions, and the moment you donât respect Xenomorphs is the minute you die in a gory mess. Spawning is reactive to the players movements. Make a lot of noise, and you are calling the Xenomorphs to you. In combat with Xenomorphs, death is very much an inevitable reality.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ICONIC WEAPONS AND GEAR</strong><br/>
Locate hotspots with your Motion Tracker. Unleash a hailstorm of bullet fire with your Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, and more from your arsenal to battle the Perfect Organism.</p>

      <title>Combining exploration, city-building and complex resource management, Scorchlands 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Native Linux support and full Steam Deck support with the 1.0 release, Scorchlands has left Early Access. There's no Steam Deck rating just yet from Valve, but the developer made it clear the 1.0 update is "fully compatible with the Steam Deck" and they have "added full controller support and UI scaling to enhance the gameplay experience".</p>
<p>What is it? Well, it's kind of complicated to describe. It's a strategy game that has elements of a city builder, with complex resource management. Where you travel across the land to keep expanding much like you do in Factorio for example, you're not some nameless thing in the sky. Eventually you'll be transforming barren surfaces into meadows, forests, lakes and vibrant settlements. It's a real interesting mix and now has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hex grid-based city-building â construct various buildings in your colonies. Each structure's productivity depends on neighboring resources and other constructions.</li>
<li>Complex resource management â itâs not only about extracting materials. Scorchlands takes account of logistics â the movement of resources between colonies and combining them in robust processing chains. And yes, we move resources using LASERS!</li>
<li>Terraforming for the greater good â utilize magic and technology to change the biomes on procedurally generated maps and exploit the new environment to gain its unique resources.</li>
<li>Technology designed to give fun â thereâs no fun in a sandbox, if you donât have the toys to play with. The technology system in Scorchlands is key for player progression and new discoveries open up new ways to play with the game world.</li>
<li>Minimalistic combat system â when you get into a fight, positioning will be key. Destroy your enemies by surrounding them and placing your forces in optimal locations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Old School Rally now Steam Deck Verified with an impressive roadmap ahead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old School Rally released recently and it not only looks fantastic for retro rally fans, it's also now Steam Deck Verified. Valve did the verification on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/proton-9-0-2-brings-better-controller-support-in-launchers-more-playable-games-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9</a>, so desktop Linux users will be good to go as well!</p>
<p>With carefully crafted retro visuals, it looks straight out of the 90s and I love it.</p>
<p>The developer recently put up a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2824660/view/4328605968607182702" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of what's to come that includes custom car liveries, a photo mode, an arcade mode to race the AI, full replay and highlight reel support, a local co-op mode, Steam Workshop support and more. After release they're also looking to continue updates adding in more cars, stages and driver statistics.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RACE THE WORLD - With a variety of rally tracks from around the globe, race across different surfaces such as dirt, tarmac and snow and challenge your driving skills.</li>
<li>RALLY CARS - Choose from a diverse lineup of rally cars inspired by the legends of the past, each with unique characteristics and features.</li>
<li>LEADERBOARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS - Challenge other drivers from around the world and climb to the top of the leaderboards. Ready for more? Try to get all the achievements over the course of the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more and more games getting Steam Deck Verified so early like this. Old School Rally still has 6-10 months to go in Early Access yet.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It's currently in Early Access.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Additionally a dedicated Steam Deck improvement with "Updated resolution on Steam Deck button Icons" so now they should look a lot clearer.

      <title>Spinny Dungeon is an upcoming slot machine roguelite that might eat away your time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Spinny Dungeon won't suck away your money like a real slot machine, it will eat away your time. Certainly not the first to come up with the idea, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/luck-be-a-landlord-gives-slot-machines-a-little-deck-building-flavour/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luck be a Landlord</a> also a pretty great version of it.</p>
<p>This is a bit different though, not only is it based on slots, it's also an auto-battler as well. Talk about a true blend of genres here. More about it: "You were crawling through dungeons as usual. One dungeon... You saw a strange portal in the corner of the room and a huge button in front of it. You pressed that button. Then you pressed it again, and again, and again...</p>
<p>The Demon of the Slot Machine has sent his minions to find your soul. Stop these monsters before they reach the RED ZONE."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q-y_dH-b3TM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c668471645322802bc2a90ffabe6c62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q-y_dH-b3TM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build the perfect deck.</strong> Add weapons, plants, magic artifacts and companions to your deck of symbols. After each spin they will be randomly rearranged on the board.</li>
<li><strong>Don't starve.</strong> Picking a strong companion who eats too much can be fatal not only to your enemies but also to your run.</li>
<li><strong>Mana, gold or pure damage?</strong> It's hard to have plenty of all. So choose wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Learn new spells and upgrade the old ones.</strong> Defeating the boss at the end of the level will give you access to more powerful spells.</li>
<li><strong>Explore various play styles with different heroes.</strong> You can get rich by stealing gold from the foes or crush them instantly by blowing up your own symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Atone for your sins.</strong> The Demon of the Slot Machine knows that gambling is not your only sin. Every sin adds its own challenge. You need to complete all the challenges to free your soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Steam page it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837790/Spinny_Dungeon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Follow it along on Steam</a>. No release date set currently.</p>

      <title>Valve gives developers some big reasons to add a demo on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have overhauled the way game demos work on Steam in some big ways, and it sounds like a really good thing for both developers and players.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/6233628070477025190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam, demos can now have their own full store page. This allows developers to accurately describe the demo with what features the demo specifically offers, along with all the usual bits like trailers and screenshots. This will also display a banner linking back to the full game.</p>
<p>This also means you can directly follow a demo page, to be notified when it's actually live. Nice! It also gives players the ability to review the demo too.</p>
<p>Demos will also appear across Steam in various places, acting as if they're a free game. So you can expect to see them in charts like New &amp; Trending and across all the tags. This sounds good, but I imagine this will also increase the complaints from developers on their new releases being quickly pushed down by demo releases. Still, nice for players to find them easier.</p>
<p>Demos also have their behaviour tweaked for your Steam Library:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can add demos to your library without having to immediately install them. Just click on the new "add to library" button next to demos you may not be ready to install (while using the mobile app, for instance).</li>
<li>Demos can be installed even if you already own the full game. Primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos, but it will also help players more easily manage installing/uninstalling demos.</li>
<li>Demos can be explicitly removed from an account by right-clicking &gt; manage &gt; remove from account.</li>
<li>When a demo is uninstalled, it will automatically get removed from your library.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The 1.0 release for 7 Days to Die is finally here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day some thought would never come, 7 Days to Die 1.0 is officially out now with quite the price increase to go with it. Previously Â£18.99, it's now Â£37.99.</p>
<p>There's far too much new for me to list here but some highlights include a new HD character system, new player armour / clothing system, new animal models, a new challenge system, new vehicle models, world generation upgrades, new points of interest, new zombie variants and updates to existing zombie types, lighting graphics upgrades, various performance optimizations, the progression system was improved, an enhanced gore system, updated road decals, much improved gamepad support and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Lots more to be seen in the <a href="https://7daystodie.com/v1-0-official-release-notes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozBN-pEUBvo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30085c56f263127c5bdc4913e5ed1d3b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozBN-pEUBvo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">As a reminder, while technically it's released now and they've pushed it out of Early Access, it's not actually finished. They have a roadmap of big updates to come that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update 1 - Storm's Brewing - Q4 2024 - New Weather System and Biome Progression Overhaul, a Wardrobe System, Crossplay, new Zombie Stages, the Spawn Near Friend ability, Twitch Drops, outfit DLCs, and more.</li>
<li>Update 2 - A New Threat - Q2 2025 - UI / Menu overhaul, Bandits, Event System, New Quest Type</li>
<li>Update 3 - The Road Ahead - Q4 2025 - Trader Overhaul, Story Mode, Steam Workshop Support, New Quest Type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Native Linux version seems to run about the same as it usually does, which is nice to see they've kept up with all the updates over the years. The Steam Overlay wouldn't work for me normally, although it did when run via <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>. The OpenGL version also seems to have glitchy shadows, changing it over to Vulkan in the launcher seemed to fix that but they still have a note that the Vulkan version isn't fully supported.</p>

      <title>Truckful is a gorgeous looking trucking delivery game with something dark lurking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful has been announced by MythicOwl, who recently released the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/planetiles-is-a-beautiful-blend-of-tetris-and-dorfromantik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">really wonderful Planetiles</a> and Truckful looks like one not to be missed.</p>
<p>An adventure where you're basically a delivery driver where you run errands and quests for various villagers, but something strange is going on with an ancient mystery in the nearby old forest. Looks like a really fun and strange blend this one. Seems a bit like MudRunner for the trucking, but with an interesting sounding narrative to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11625476991721913452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From what they said it will be a test of your driving skills seeing you go through winding roads, dusty lowlands, and charming towns with an assortment of different goods that you'll need to take care of, with no two errands being the same. Eventually, you'll want to go off the beaten track to explore the ancient forest on the outskirts with its "dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadowsâ¦ Explore hidden paths, navigate misty wetlands, and brave treacherous marshes and quicksands to uncover the truth beneath the branches".</p>

      <title>Fallout: London mod for Fallout 4 has released today on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fallout: London, the hotly anticipated game-changing mod for Fallout 4 is now finally available via GOG, because it's simply too big for modding sites. If you own Fallout 4 on GOG, you're good to go since GOG haven't updated to the "next-gen" version. If you have it on Steam, you'll need to downgrade to version 1.10.163.0.</p>
<p>More about it: "Fallout: London is an ambitious, trail-blazing DLC-sized mod for Fallout 4, Bethesda Game Studiosâ 2015 post-apocalyptic RPG. Fallout: London stands apart from its contemporaries and offers an entirely new experience: setting a Fallout game outside of the United States. True to its moniker, Fallout: London takes place IN London. From stuffy parliamentary aristocrats to a resurrection of the Knights of the Round Table to an uncompromising cult of revolutionaries (and more!), Fallout: London embodies the history and aesthetics of London and puts an unmistakably nuclear spin on the beloved city."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rahBCfRdVac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d31c56e868b623119f20bc47b6e3e39.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rahBCfRdVac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently for Linux players, it seems a bit messy. I've been unable to use the Steam Downgrader for Linux from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1?tab=files" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus</a>, because the zip file just seems broken (I've let them know. <strong>Update: They fixed it</strong>). For GOG owners though, you should <em>hopefully</em> be able to download both Fallout 4 and London via the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: GOG kindly sent me a Fallout 4 key, so I'm testing via the Heroic Launcher. Downloading Fallout London and Fallout 4, setting them each to use GE-Proton 9-10 and then running Fallout London brings up the installer correctly. You'll need to manually pick the Fallout 4 location, as it won't find it automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19424880041721914701gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19424880041721914701gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5579382091721914703gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5579382091721914703gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Strangely, the Wine file-picker couldn't display my /home folder, so I also had to use the Winecfg button in Heroic's settings on Fallout London, to then manually add my /home folder where Fallout 4 is installed. Then it <em>was</em> able to find it properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15991875221721915555gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15991875221721915555gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then it will come up with their launcher once installed. And you just click Play on Fallout London from inside Heroic each time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15291156231721916511gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15291156231721916511gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears to work using the GOG version downloaded via Heroic. However, I'm not hearing any of the dialogue being spoken, which I've seen from videos elsewhere that there is voice-acting. Tested with both GE-Proton and Proton Experimental, and on both the audio just doesn't seem right. So we may need some Proton / Wine fixes for Fallout London to work properly.</p>

      <title>STALKER 2 delayed until November to fix unexpected anomalies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World have decided to again delay the release of STALKER 2, as it's simply not ready for the public yet.</p>
<p>So that gives Valve even more time to continue working on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to ensure it runs everything nicely. I imagine too much for the Steam Deck though, probably desktop Linux only for this one. Although, I've been surprised by a few bigger games so we'll have to see.</p>
<p>From the press release: âWe know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more âunexpected anomaliesâ (or simply âbugsâ, as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding - it means the world to us. Weâre just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.â said Yevhen Grygorovych, Game Director at GSC Game World.</p>
<p>So now it's going to release November 20th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vxeGyXSM5Pc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3cf1e884422ce02c067ec050b24d96ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">We're going to get more info on August 12th though, as they will be doing a Developer Deep Dive in collab with Xbox that will go over never before seen content including:</p>
<ul>
<li>- Interviews and behind-the-scenes of the development process.</li>
<li>- Lots of new footage, including world overview, various locations, gameplay and cutscenes.</li>
<li>- A full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pre-order via:</p>

      <title>Hexis is a slightly chaotic spin on Tetris where blocks come in all directions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This isn't your classic Tetris, this is Hexis, a block-falling puzzle game about building up your high score but the blocks will come from all directions. <em>Note: key sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>It's a simple no-frills puzzle game, that succeeds at exactly what it describes. Blocks made of hexagons stitched together will come from the sides towards the center of the screen, initially quite slow but it will speed up. You'll need to fit them all together, to get them to vanish to build up your score before you pile them too close to the borders around the screen.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2G3Ck9vfcko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86b1b9dbb1e6377e7ce92d78c8c6337f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2G3Ck9vfcko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has the traditional line-building in such block-falling games, one feature added in recently is the addition of bonus lines where if you line up the colours exactly as shown, you'll get some extra points. Just a fun little extra challenge to it, but not necessary to do.</p>
<p>For those who find the main mode too easy, there's a couple of different modes where you'll have to think pretty darn fast with multiple blocks at a time. But the main mode is reasonably chilled.</p>
<p>Initially launched in June, the developer told me via email it was developed on Linux! Overall, it's a well-built puzzler to spend some chilled-out time with.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764350/Hexis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for MetalMercs with retro real-time tactical mech squad action</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MetalMercs could be a good one for those of you who love customizable mech combat action, and this time it's not turn-based it's actually real-time. The simplistic retro visuals will be an acquired taste though I think on this one but it seems like the gameplay will make up for it.</p>
<p>"Destroy. Salvage. Repair. Upgrade. PROFIT! MetalMercs offers a real-time tactical experience where you command your own mercenary outfit of mechs and mercs and adventure through randomly generated missions filled with rewards, glory, and bitter defeat."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0Pe2PT00GAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54a88f68ffae443b0fb8cd7a6c9cd468.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0Pe2PT00GAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Strategic Gameplay </strong>- Command your squad in battle and plan your tactics to dominate the battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Precision Strikes</strong> - Turn the tide and cripple enemies with called shots where YOU direct powerful attacks against your enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Salvage and Scrap</strong> - Make key choices between missions to salvage spare parts and mechs, or use your salvage rights to keep your mechs operational.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade and Customize</strong> - Earn cash and parts to upgrade your mechs, enhancing their capabilities with powerful weapons and advanced technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Missions</strong> - Each mission offers different objectives and outcomes based on your strategic choices and actions.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Depth</strong> - Every decision matters, from the deployment of forces to the management of resources, adding tension and importance to every action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does use some AI generation though, which the developer notes includes "This game currently uses some stand-in images created via generative AI. This includes some background screens, fluff images, and pilot portraits. All other gameplay visuals are manually crafted."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3045070/MetalMercs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a> with a Native Linux demo.</p>

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard gets Steam Deck Verified well ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's a lovely surprise. Dragon Age: The Veilguard just got Steam Deck Verified, showing that Valve have been testing it ready for the upcoming release. Testing was done on the latest stable version of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, which is currently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/proton-9-0-2-brings-better-controller-support-in-launchers-more-playable-games-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-2</a>.</p>
<p>A release date hasn't yet even been announced, we just know it will be sometime this "Fall", which is sometime between September - December, so that's <em>really</em> early for the testing to be done.</p>
<p>Good news, since this means it should work just fine on desktop Linux too since it will be run with Valve's Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CTNwHShylIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20d1ccf2f4f642b3eefd90bfa32ba547.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CTNwHShylIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>Will you be picking up Dragon Age: The Veilguard at release? I must admit, the Dragon Age games kind of flew past me. I've only played one of them and wasn't overly hooked on it. But since Baldur's Gate 3, I'm definitely into RPGs once again so maybe this time it will get me more into it after being refreshed by BG3.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: the developer <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1816511768044163410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on X (Twitter) that "the EA App will not be required to play the game". Great news!</p>

      <title>Top-down Terraria-like &#39;Necesse&#39; gets a huge graphics update on August 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necesse is an impressive game but the graphics were a bit on the plain side. This changes dramatically on August 10 with the exciting Graphics Update. Very much a play it as you want it game, a lot like a top-down Terraria even with elements of village building with NPC helpers too with a sprinkle of RimWorld even.</p>
<p>The indie developer Fair Games ApS expanded and pulled in two new artists, and this work has been in progress for at least a year so it's great to see it finally arrive.</p>
<p>Check out how it will look in the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K_egmB6i9zc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ccb7458b70933dc2db0ce8f3ca4922e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K_egmB6i9zc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>That actually looks a huge amount better.</em></p>
<p>The developer actually announced late last year that it had sold over a million copies, so no doubt this will help pull in even more players new to the world. </p>
<p>Necesse has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy it from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Horticular is a beautifully relaxing garden-restoring game inspired by Viva Pinata</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired in parts by both Viva Pinata and Rollercoaster Tycoon, inDirection Games and Slug Disco just released Horticular and it's as sweet as they come. <em>Note: key provided by publisher.</em></p>
<p>For cozy game fans, this is absolutely the one for you. Especially if you're a bit of a green finger. I myself am not, I kill every plant that's ever given to me, but at least now I can do it total safety and not have to feel bad about killing yet another cactus.</p>
<p>Here you've been magically summoned by mysterious gnomes to restore a long-lost garden. In some ways, it actually reminds me of Terra Nil, which is about restoring a wasteland but here it's gardening. Similar idea, very different in design overall though. If you enjoyed Terra Nil, I think you would enjoy this a bit too. Less of a puzzle game though, more of a sandbox to beautify the land.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sFe5iQ6D2sM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e461f9a2a74cb80e87854e3748d73312.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sFe5iQ6D2sM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Horticular is all about taking your time, and just making everything look sweet. It has a day / night cycle, and a weather system too. You can't even speed things up during the day, so you can just sit back and make the most of it. You do have a real sense of purpose here though, it's not just idle building. As you progress you unlock more and more, eventually you can get some animals to arrive if you ensure they have everything they need.</p>
<p>Even if you're not particularly creative, there's plenty there to keep you going through the quests and challenges where the progress nicely drip-feeds more into the game for you. Especially with the gold and upgrade system, you can go for hours and hours at a time. And for those who are creative, the sandbox mode is for you where you don't have to follow the story along.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support that worked without issues and well worth a purchase if you love more casual games. Really does allow you to just zone-out and get fixing up the place.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928540/Horticular/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>The new detachable JSAUX Dock will fit a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X, Legion Go and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have to hand it to JSAUX, they have something for everything at this point. And they just launched their new 6-in-1 JSAUX Dock that can be pulled apart. Compatible with the Steam Deck, ROG Ally / Ally X, Legion Go and no doubt many others if they all fit.</p>
<p>If you're somehow still in the market for a handheld device dock, despite them being everywhere and JSAUX having 1â¦2â¦6 etc models, here's <em>another</em> choice for you with the "6-in-1 Multifunctional Docking Station".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the inputs it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>1* USB-C port for connecting to the handheld device.</li>
<li>1* USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).</li>
<li>2* USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).</li>
<li>1* Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps).</li>
<li>1* HDMI (4K@120Hz).</li>
<li>1* USB-C (PD 100W input).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16174789061721829190gol1.png"/></p>
<p>At $45.99 it seems like a really good deal for what you get, a decent amount of ports and looks pretty nice.</p>
<p>The unique point about this one? The hub part that takes all the inputs can be pulled out of the base of the dock. So it's quite portable overall. Makes me think perhaps they <em>might</em> eventually sell upgrades for the actual input hub part of the dock, to just slot it into the base. At that price though, they will probably just make a whole new one.</p>

      <title>In Hollow Survivors: Prologue you play as one of the few remaining sane Hollows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Survivors: Prologue is out today, giving us a slice of what to expect from this rogue-lite dungeon crawler where you play as one of the few remaining sane Hollows. Since it's a Prologue, it's more like a standalone demo but it seems to be worth a look and offers Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>While you may be thinking, oh no, <em>another</em> survivor-like but not quite. While it certainly has <em>some</em> elements popularised by Vampire Survivors, that it seems like half of the indie world is copying, like picking random upgrades it's a lot more than that. This is a seriously stylish and atmospheric dungeon crawler. Well, more like a tower crawler in this case with you climbing stairs after each area is defeated to ascend ever higher.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G1l5ZOliaFk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/38189b9153736fd217ce1cf099bd8468.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G1l5ZOliaFk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been playing it through and think it's a delight. Some great action, and the character builds you can make are really interesting. What makes it quite fun is that you only have three main abilities: your main weapon, a magical blast and to quick-dodge. But when you level up, you pick from a set of randomized abilities to power each of them up. So when you dodge you might hit enemies with lightning, or your magical blast might additionally add another hit to enemies after a short countdown and so on.</p>
<p>The style of it is just fantastic overall, really worth a go.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909680/Hollow_Survivors_Prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for ColdRidge a Wild West turn-based exploration game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, <strong>ColdRidge</strong> is a cowboy themed Wild West turn-based exploration game that looks really worth your time. Coming from the Paris-based team at Frog Collective, this is their first game.</p>
<p>Step into the rugged boots of a prospector and venture into the untamed wilderness of Coldridge, a land shrouded in mystery and plagued by a sinister curse. Your mission: uncover precious resources, tackle intricate puzzles, and strategically manage contracts to maximize your gains. Unveil the enigmatic secrets of the guild and their grip on Coldridge in this captivating adventure.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lTXoQQIVk4o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3818ff92a235b05f3cc620e41a857300.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lTXoQQIVk4o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Currently the demo only notes a Windows icon, but there is a full Native Linux demo available.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>EXPLORE THE UNTAMED WILDERNESS - Traverse the uncharted territories of Coldridge, mapping out resources for the all-powerful guild. Each step into the wild presents new challenges and opportunities as you navigate through the treacherous landscapes.</li>
<li>HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD - Carefully plan your expeditions by choosing the right contracts. Will you play it safe with calculated risks, or will you dare to gamble for potentially greater rewards? The choices you make could lead to fortune or peril.</li>
<li>MASTER MOVEMENT PLANNING - Fulfill your contracts by meticulously planning your moves. Utilize the terrain and your equipment to gain an edge, outmaneuver obstacles, and complete your objectives efficiently.</li>
<li>UNLOCK NEW CHARACTERS - Experience rogue-lite progression as you unlock new characters and objects. Each playthrough offers fresh challenges and opportunities. See how long you can survive and how deep you can delve into the secrets of Coldridge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing out the demo, it definitely gives off some vibes from the early exploration stage in the Civilization series and other similar games. A lot more compact than that though, a lot more focused on the individual and your little quests.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. It should release sometime late this year.</p>

      <title>Humble Games confirmed a &#39;restructuring of operations&#39; with reports of all staff gone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tough times for indies, as Humble Games have confirmed they've done a "restructuring" of the publisher with previous staff saying <em>everyone</em> has been let go. This does not affect Humble Bundle / Humble Store though, as they were separate.</p>
<p>Reports coming in from yesterday with various ex-staffers posting on LinkedIn, like Emilee Kieffer, who was a Senior QA at Humble Games in a post that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games" and they also <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (Twitter) that the "entirety of Humble Games was laid off this morning". Another is Nicola Kwan who was a BizDev at Humble Games, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on LinkedIn as well noting that "At 9AM this morning, all 36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down.".</p>
<p>Eventually, Humble Games posted a <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (Twitter) that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle.</p>
<p>We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p>
<p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The website <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aftermath</a> managed to obtain a recording of a meeting where everyone was let go, and they were told that a third-party named The Powell Group will be finishing up any remaining projects.</p>
<p>Chris Radley, former Creative Lead at Humble Games (but left in 2022) didn't hold back on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a> mentioning no staff are left:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want it to be made abundantly clear, this is NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of #HumbleGames. Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left.<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT believe this AI message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was ONCE AGAIN a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative and its so disrespectful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting Humble Games (and Humble Bundle) are owned by IGN's parent company, Ziff Davis, who also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ign-acquired-the-gamer-network-including-rps-eurogamer-vg247-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently acquired Gamer Network</a> including RPS, Eurogamer, VG247 and more and then fired a bunch of staff too.</p>

<p>Kitsune Tails, the platformer styled after beloved classics and steeped in Japanese mythology, shows off a bunch of retro minigames and some pretty powerful modding support that will be available at launch.</p>
<p>Coming with full Native Linux and Steam Deck support, I think this is going to be one to remember. Kitsune Games, who previously made games including MidBoss and Ultra Hat Dimension are crafting something pretty ridiculous here.</p>
<p>The new trailer that went up today shows off the power of their hand-made game engine with all the platforming you could want. However, to spice it up the mini-games are a whole lot of something else including Haunted Heist, a first-person maze-crawling experience inspired by early FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D with the chase-and-escape tactics of Pac-Man. There's even games like Boulder Dash and Arkanoid. What more could you want in a retro-styled game?</p>

<p>If that wasn't enough there's also simple to use modding tools to make your own levels and mini-games with Lua, along with the open source Tiled Map Editor. So, in a way, this is a platformer with a whole fantasy console included.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic platforming action set in a land inspired by Japanese mythology.</li>
<li>Explore five elemental worlds and various haunted houses.</li>
<li>Learn new elemental powers and use them to find secrets and optional story content.</li>
<li>Use cute outfits to power up or stomp around by stealing a giant boot from enemies.</li>
<li>Uncover the reasons behind your childhood friend's jealous betrayal.</li>
<li>Stomp on pangos to make them curl into a ball, pick them up, and kick them around.</li>
<li>Carry lights through haunted houses to reveal secret doors and ward off ghosts.</li>
<li>Unlock and play over a half dozen minigames for cash and power ups.</li>
<li>Struggling? Buy more power ups at the shop or change playstyles for an instant-revive.</li>
<li>Play through the bonus world after rolling credits and prove you've got what it takes to beat the kaizo levels.</li>
<li>Optional true-to-life CRT filter for maximum nostalgia.</li>
<li>Make custom levels using mature open source tools.</li>
<li>Create and play custom minigames using the same Lua scripting the developers used.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Apple design award winner Afterplace just released on PC with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally a mobile game that won an Apple design award, Afterplace is an open world adventurous retro game for those who like to get lost. Today it released on PC with full Native Linux support. Always nice to see a popular mobile game make its way onto more platforms!</p>
<p>More about it from the developer: Afterplace is an adventurous retro game for those who like to get lost. It's a huge open world, full of hidden secrets, treasures, and creatures. You'll run around the woods, fight monsters, and talk to ostensibly shady characters! All from the comfort of your couch (or toilet)! You never know what the forest might be hiding, and not all trails are paved. Labyrinths and dungeons are tucked away in the most concealed nooks. There are no waypoints in Afterplace. You'll have to forge your own path.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LCQN5LDPvKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/235cd480c2c49f3087a39683b4b89680.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LCQN5LDPvKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned: "It should run on any Linux distro that supports OpenGL and can run a C++ executable, and supports all the features of its PC and Mac counterparts!". The feature list they mentioned is also somewhat amusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>About 10 hours of unique gameplay (and much more if you lose your way)</li>
<li>No overworld map</li>
<li>An open world that lets you explore any path in any order</li>
<li>Tons of friends, enemies, and at least one frenemy</li>
<li>The ability to upgrade weapons, purchase armor, and ingest hazardous chemicals to increase your power</li>
<li>Okay maybe there is an overworld map</li>
<li>Multiple endings, decided by choices you probably don't even know you're making</li>
<li>Like 25 unique enemies? That's a lot, right?</li>
<li>Wait, no, this overworld map is written on a napkin with crayon. That won't do.</li>
<li>Secret paths that will take you to completely normal and fun places</li>
<li>A cat that you can pet. With your sword.</li>
<li>The 25 unique monsters are really special though. They have sparkling personalities, and aren't like other monsters.</li>
<li>At least two overworld maps.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bit confusing, but the funny kind and now it makes me want to play it so â job done I guess?</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>Deep space colony sim Stardeus gets a massive overhaul in a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Get ready to put together a spaceship again, as the deep space colony sim Stardeus has a really massive update out now and it's looking great. Basically, it's RimWorld on a spaceship and it's cool.</p>
<p>From developer Kodo Linija and publisher Paradox Arc (Paradox Interactive), it's a game that's easy to lose not just hours in but days at a time. Set aboard a damaged starship, crewed by drones and hibernating human survivors as the game's immortal AI, you'll command drones to repair the starship, make critical decisions about the human crew, and explore a procedurally generated universe filled with complexity.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This big new update, named Bioverse, is the biggest since it entered Early Access back in 2022 adding in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revamped AI system</li>
<li>Enhanced combat mechanics</li>
<li>Innovative body part system, including new health, stats, conditions, and abilities system</li>
<li>New content: Additional scenario, new devices, materials, species and more</li>
<li>New trade system</li>
<li>Twitch Integration</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-zwHOfoZ_Kg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e9e2b574aea80e56602fa03fb2e64f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-zwHOfoZ_Kg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has full Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>Well worth looking into. Had a blast playing it pre-release when doing Steam Deck checks with the developer, and it's grown a lot since then. It has a Very Positive rating on Steam too from over a thousand players.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/stardeus?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
