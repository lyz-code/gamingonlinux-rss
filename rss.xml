      <title>Valve promise a proper big Team Fortress 2 update is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wait, what year is it? Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming. Valve announced a proper big update is planned and on the way for Team Fortress 2. Yes really.</p>
<p>It's so big they're claiming it's going to be a "full-on update-sized update". They skipped over announcing it on Twitter and instead decided to actually post an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/TF2/announcements/detail/3669906790333865368" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the TF2 Steam Page copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Workshop Creators, can we have your attention please. The following message is <em>so</em> urgent, <em>so</em> time-sensitive, we made the executive decision to skip TikTok and Twitter entirely and break the glass on the most bleeding-edge communication technology available.</p>
<p>Welcome to the future. Welcome… to a "blog-post".</p>
<p>"Wow!" you're probably thinking. "I forgot how hard reading is!" Yeah, it's scary how fast you lose that. Don't worry, we'll be brief:</p>
<p>The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates. But <em>this</em> year, we're planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update — with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!</p>
<p>So get to work! (Or back to work, if you were already working but got distracted when the entire internet simultaneously found out about this state-of-the-art blog-post.) Make sure to get your submissions into the Steam Workshop by May 1st, so they can be considered for this as-yet-unnamed, un-themed, but still very exciting summer-situated (but not summer-themed) (unless you wanted to develop summer-themed stuff) update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally released in 2007, it remains as one of the most played games on Steam (over 100,000 on it right now), although it has seen various massive bot attack problems over the last few years that Valve attempted to address across a number of smaller updates. It's nice to see they're getting back on track here, after previously releasing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/team-fortress-2-update-adds-vscript-and-you-can-now-run-linux-inside-it/" target="_blank">big scripting update</a> to make it more of a modders playground.</p>

      <title>Framework begin offering 2TB SSD upgrades for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a Steam Deck and want to upgrade the internal storage? You're not alone and plenty already have, but getting one compatible isn't exactly easy so Framework have decided to jump in.</p>
<p>For those who don't know them, Framework made their name by creating the Framework Laptop, designed to last with components that can be easily swapped out and upgraded. Seems like quite a natural fit for them to offer up easy upgrades for other devices don't you think?</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/now-offering-2tb-ssds-for-steam-deck-in-the-framework" target="_blank">their blog</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be thinking “what?” but we spotted an interesting opportunity to enable upgrades on another popular consumer electronics product: the Steam Deck. We have the first batch of these available in the Marketplace today in the US and Canada, and are exploring stocking them for Europe and Australia as well. Unlike the 2280-sized M.2 SSDs that the Framework Laptop uses, the handheld Steam Deck relies on the physically smaller but less common 2230 format. As a result, it can be difficult to find legitimate sources for larger capacity drives like 2TB ones to load all of those games that you’re totally going to play someday. Since we order a huge number of Western Digital drives already, it’s relatively easy for us to add one more line item and stock 2TB SN740 2230 ones. You can follow the guide from our friends at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+SSD+Replacement/148989" target="_blank">iFixit</a> to perform the upgrade. You can also use these drives in many Surface laptops and tablets. We’re continuing to search for ways to help you with hard-to-find upgrades for other products, so let us know if there is anything we should focus on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find them in the US and Canada on <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/products/western-digital-sn740-nvme-m-2-2230" target="_blank">their Marketplace</a>. If they do announce availability elsewhere like the EU / UK, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Thief-like stealth game The Dark Mod v2.11 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love the old first-person stealth game Thief? The Dark Mod was inspired by it and there's a new release out. Free, open source and a lot of fun to be had with many missions available to download.</p>
<p>While it is a game, it's also a complete toolkit for fans to make their own stealth missions and there's already <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/missions/" target="_blank">tons available</a>. Out of the box it doesn't really come with anything, except two example missions and a tutorial so it's up to you to seek out more content for it — although the built-in downloader can take care of that for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18380952251675954886gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18380952251675954886gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developers mentioned version 2.11 is mostly about fixing up bugs, however some new features were sprinkled in too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stealth Score and AI Alert behaviour was much improved.</li>
<li>Smoother transitions from climbing.</li>
<li>A multi-looting feature to grab multiple items at a time.</li>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>
<li>Improved graphics for shadows and volumetric lighting.</li>
<li>The Engine now supports Obj model format (good for modders).</li>
<li>GUI scripting has been overhauled with better syntax and error reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the full release <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/posts/the-dark-mod-2-11-has-been-released/" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>The new System Shock remake demo runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After going through development hell and being long delayed, Nightdive Studios have put up a fresh demo of their System Shock remake that includes controller support and a new intro.</p>
<p>To actually play it on Linux / Steam Deck, you do need to go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu and force Proton, as they've left up a seemingly old Linux launch config that's just empty and downloads nothing. It's unclear if they will still be doing a Native Linux version or not.</p>
<p>Giving it a run on Steam Deck and I was very surprised, I was expecting a game like this to really not perform well at all given that it's a demo of an unfinished game but even on Medium details for the most part it runs shockingly great. They still need to work on the new controller support some more, as the acceleration and sensitivity on thumb-stick is wildly off but it's a good start. Check out my video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y4HxnEVoMf0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/36d8499035afe1167f54af6b109ed271.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y4HxnEVoMf0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In regards to how it runs on Desktop Linux, testing it out also on Fedora 37 (KDE spin) it also runs there very nicely too on maximum settings. On both there's some shader cache stutter at certain points, but really it's not bad at all and at least on desktop the blips in framerate are tiny while it does it.</p>
<p>Still not sold on the game yet. While the world certainly looks nice and seems interesting, I'm going to need a lot more time with it. The combat, especially melee, felt quite poor and hard to judge when you're going to actually hit something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7083330291675942147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7083330291675942147gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - System Shock on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>As long as you force it to Proton so it actually downloads, it seems you're good to go.</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/482400/System_Shock/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 gets a first Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game developers might want to begin to look closer at this one! The free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> is about to have the biggest update ever with 4.0 that now has a first Release Candidate. Since it's such a massive overhaul it would be close to impossible to list everything that has changed since Godot 3.x!</p>
<p>Just a small slice of what's actually new includes: Vulkan support, sky shaders, a big upgrade to their GDScript language, upgraded .NET for C# scripting, big improvements to importing and exporting assets, lots of improvements to accessibility within the game engine editor, AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution (FSR) support, a volumetric fog effect was added, a new global illumination system, an improved and refreshed physics system and the list just keeps on going for quite some time.</p>
<p>Right now their focus is set firmly on fixing up issues and making sure it's truly release ready, so no more new features will be pulled in until Godot 4.1.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2531578531675873451gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2531578531675873451gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Godot 4.0 RC1 on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully the 4.0 release, and then 4.1 after will keep pulling more people over to this FOSS game engine, rather than getting stuck with proprietary lock-in from Unreal, Unity, Game Maker and other popular game engines.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-0-rc-1/" target="_blank">their blog post</a> for more.</p>

<p>I absolutely love this. OpenRA has done a huge service to the RTS gaming community and after growing up playing the likes of Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert I definitely appreciate it. Having all the sides together in such a way is quite fun too! Nice to see it continue to get even better.</p>

      <title>The Callisto Protocol got a Steam Deck upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Callisto Protocol, the horror game that was inspired by Dead Space, has recently gained a hardcore mode and a dedicated Steam Deck upgrade too.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1544020/view/3671032056808752461" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they mentioned this for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated font rendering and UI elements for readability.</li>
<li>Created a rendering functionality profile specifically for Steam Deck with the best settings for smooth gameplay.</li>
<li>Updated control schemes for SteamDeck controls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So I decided to give it a re-look since it's had the above, plus a few other performance upgrades since the release that I was hoping would make it a better experience. Overall, it is a lot better than it was but it can still be a little on the problematic side. </p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what this "rendering functionality profile" even does. There's no special Steam Deck preset, and they're now hiding the benchmark mode specifically on Steam Deck too — which is just odd (it shows up normally on Fedora Linux on my desktop). It's now really close to being properly playable at 30FPS out of the box, still just not quite there but at least now it's somewhat enjoyable, as the drops it still has aren't as painfully dramatic as before.</p>
<p>You can see the full first chapter of the game on Steam Deck below:</p>

<p>It's possible that YouTube might end up putting it behind an age gate, so find the <a href="https://youtu.be/FifuHvPGLVw" target="_blank">direct video link here</a>. </p>

      <title>Zelda-lite classic Anodyne gets a much upgraded fan remake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anodyne from Analgesic Productions recently celebrated a <a href="https://blog.analgesic.productions/posts/2023-02-04-Anodyne-10th-Anniversary" target="_blank">10th anniversary</a>, and the community delivered in style with a full fan remake for modern platforms thanks to the previous source code release. The original is not open source but "source available", since it has a custom license with the new fan remake available under the same licensing.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this unique Zelda-lite game, explore and fight your way through surreal and creepy, nature, urban and abstract themed areas in the human Young's subconscious, evoked by a 16-bit-era visual style and a moody, dream-like soundtrack. Talk to bizarre characters and survive through Game Boy-styled dungeons, while hunting down mysterious keys and cards that will allow you to dive deeper into the dream world."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7816379491675858665gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7816379491675858665gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Anodyne Fan Remake on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>An overview of the changes in the Anodyne Fan Remake includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Render at 60 FPS using OpenGL, effects are done using shaders instead of CPU-side computation</li>
<li>Controller support
<ul>
<li>Switch Pro controller support needs Steam to be active to work correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indicator of currently selected broom in top left of the screen
<ul>
<li>Swapping between brooms doesn't require using the menu - PgUp/Dwn and controller shoulder buttons switch between them, 1-4 sets the current broom directly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unopened chest indicator on minimaps on screens you've visited. No more searching for that one chest in the entire dungeon you missed</li>
<li>Minimap shows floor numbers for multi-floor dungeons</li>
<li>Return to entrance now returns you to the screen where you entered the dungeon (most notable in REDCAVE with its multiple entrances)</li>
<li>Several bugfixes for softlocks and non-essential glitches (wiggle glitch is still in, have fun!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the changes, it can work nicely out of the box on modern systems instead of the ancient and unsupported Adobe tech. I've tested it working great on Fedora Linux (see screenshot above) and also working just fine on Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it in action on Steam Deck where just like desktop Linux it works great:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Y9z1QuPAe-k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4dcb184d093686c00b2dfbed7635f485.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Y9z1QuPAe-k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Playing this in bed will really bring back memories of doing the same with the original Game Boy that I had. </em></p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Splittown gets a new Linux demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splittown is an upcoming point and click adventure about the Cold War, where the world is split in two and now there's a Linux demo. Their plan to release this was noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/point-and-click-adventure-splittown-linux-support/" target="_blank">a previous article</a>, where the developer reached out to me after for some pre-release testing and it was looking great!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cold War has split the world in two, both figuratively and literally. The Great Divide spans across the globe with an impenetrable mess of concrete and barbed wire sandwiched between the two blocs. You are Leonard Nimby; stone-faced former top agent of IM5, hot on the trail of a shrink gun stolen from you by a villanous mayoral candidate on the eve of a fateful election.<br/>
<br/>
Splittown is a point-and-click adventure game inspired by 90s classics such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road. You'll crack confounding puzzles, stuff improbable amounts of items in your pockets, and engage in humorous dialogue with a colorful cast of characters on an adventure that will push your wits to the limit.</p>

      <title>Interior Worlds is an upcoming weird spooky liminal space photography game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A slightly spooky and weird exploration game about taking snaps, Interior Worlds seems interesting and it's coming to Linux too. Speaking to the developer, they noted Linux support will come slightly after the Windows release.</p>
<p>I don't think I can even begin to properly describe this one so I'll leave it to the developer: "Welcome to Interior Worlds; an ambient and unsettling first-person exploration game where you'll dive into strange, yet familiar spaces. Temporary gaps and portals we cross at some point or another - now yearning for a closer look. A look that can only be seen properly through the lens of an SLR camera."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mSHPkTUvMSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78c17789b60e22d9c1bc5ee85dc89a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mSHPkTUvMSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your vintage and mysterious analog camera to capture stunning photographs of environmental anomalies throughout each space. Keep a sharp eye out while traversing the more... ominous locations.</li>
<li>Track and share your own in-game catalog of photos, timestamped and pre-filtered with subtle layers of maximum liminal crust.</li>
<li>Ten unique thresholds to traverse. A roadside hotel, empty movie theater, dying mall, and many more. Every environment is hand-crafted in a loving throwback to late 90's and early 00's graphics.</li>
<li>A multitude of ways to capture photos. Adjust zoom levels, increase/decrease lens focus, tilt left/right for a dutch angle, and more. Create perturbing compositions in hundreds of ways.</li>
<li>Unparalleled interactivity. Activate vending machines, phones, sinks, televisions, or simply turn the lights on or off for a different photo-moment vibe.</li>
<li>Immersive and unsettling soundscape. Melt into an eerie mix of low, rumbling drones and soft, stretched pads during the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Something you might find interesting? </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207970/Interior_Worlds/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> with a release coming in March.</p>

      <title>Trackmania is looking great on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackmania has released on Steam recently and thanks to the recent Ubisoft Connect <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-deck-linux-proton-7-0-6-ea-ubisoft/" target="_blank">fixes from Valve in Proton 7.0-6</a>, Trackmania works great on Steam Deck. It's free to play and has in-game purchases for the full content, however you can play rather a lot without spending a penny.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lCyUBmG40h4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5666bc06dd088a70f2b22b8ae0b29bb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lCyUBmG40h4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Desktop Linux users, I've also been testing it on Fedora and it works just great there too. At 1440p it will always stay above 60FPS on max details on my Ryzen 5800x + NVIDIA 2080Ti, most of the time at least ~90FPS but it does heavily depend on the map being played. Some maps are nothing on system resources, others can bring it down a fair bit.</p>
<p>A few dips when it needs to compile a shader that doesn't happen again on a second run, nothing too severe though. Overall, quite happy with the performance myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16655067461675792877gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16655067461675792877gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This really does bring back some memories of playing the first game so long ago.</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2225070/Trackmania/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Customizable platform fighter Fraymakers is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some really slick animations, the customizable platform fighter Fraymakers has launched in Early Access on Steam with Linux support. It went into Early Access on January 19th that somehow I forgot about, even though I purchased it and played it — woops. I'm only human right?</p>
<p>Following the success of the Kickstarter that back in 2020 that gave them $364,922 in funding (before taxes and expenses ate into it that is), it's nice to see it out and so far it's showing plenty of potential. Some of the key selling points on this is the varied cast of indie game characters, along with the custom content creation system that you can easily download extras for in the Steam Workshop.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cW8oNo1hbmw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72c8608223e4f193f97eafdb2d54e732.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cW8oNo1hbmw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> - Fraymakers is designed to be friendly to new players and challenging and expressive for veteran players. You’re going to have a ton of fun whether you want a quick round with your friends or you’re looking to climb the leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback Netcode</strong> - If you’ve been part of the fighting game community over the past few years, you know that rollback is the gold standard for fighting game netcode. We’ve prioritized and designed around rollback from the outset of development, meaning that Fraymakers will provide the smoothest possible online experience.</li>
<li><strong>Full Movesets</strong> - With over 80 animations per character, we've skipped nothing! Each character comes complete with every motion and attack you've come to expect from a platform fighter as well as some brand new techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Assists</strong> - Choose from a massive selection of indie characters to unleash an attack, fire a projectile, buff your character, or inflict a special status effect on your foes.</li>
<li><strong>...And Infinite Expandability!</strong> - We designed both the game and our custom content editor to be accessible and powerful. We want the process of creating your own content to be simple and fun. Whether you're a player or a creator, this means that the possibilities are endless.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's already a good amount of extra content being loaded up in the Steam Workshop, someone even added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928636648&amp;searchtext=" target="_blank">Trunks</a> from Dragon Ball Z which I naturally had to try out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6471494231675790847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6471494231675790847gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So far at least on Desktop Linux (Fedora) it works quite well. Controller support is a little odd, as sometimes my controller needs a good minute and some button mashing before it's actually detected, and other times the vibration won't stop for a while. The usual expected Early Access release bugs. </p>
<p>Looks fantastic though, the official characters have some gorgeous style and animations done on them, I only hope the developers can keep up the progress on it now it has people wanting more.</p>

      <title>Colony builder Maia gets big optimizations, along with controller and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A name I've not heard for a while that I seemed to miss some emails on recently. Colony building sim Maia, from developer Simon Roth, had a rather <em>big</em> upgrade. This is the first major update since early in 2021.</p>
<p>Some major new features were added to the game including: an entirely new mini-map system to let you get a glimpse of your colony, controller support and big optimizations to performance to help lower end devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N0J-ykZbos8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9d788102b19967902b0225a7b9b5aaf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N0J-ykZbos8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a shader issue with AMD GPU driver support that was stopping the game from running for some users.</li>
<li>Pause button on keyboard now rebindable.</li>
<li>Fix for colonists trying to make small adjustments whilst running causing them to abruptly come to a half and then start running again.</li>
<li>Upgraded SDL support.</li>
<li>Objective flashing animation improved.</li>
<li>Rain textures and animation improved.</li>
<li>Grid simulation no longer shows invalid values on energy storage devices when the game is paused.</li>
<li>Lava simulation optimised and threading removed to prevent crashes. (Full lava rewrite postponed due to complexity)</li>
<li>Colonists will now prioritise the meteor pickups in the second level of the campaign.</li>
<li>Massively reduced the constraint iterations on the cloth simulations to improve CPU performance when the player has lots of flags.</li>
<li>Fix for incorrect light colour in Radiation Containment room.</li>
<li>Protobird sleep behaviour fixed to stop it running automatically into groom behaviour.</li>
<li>Capsules landing will no longer set the ground on fire if the ground is covered in snow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It has a Native Linux version but the developer recommended Proton (specifically GE-Proton) for playing on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>While the game has struggled over the years to find an audience, and deal with some of the more problematic parts of the AI, it's nice to see such an interesting take on a colony builder still continue to be improved many years later.</p>
<p>You can buy Maia on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252250/Maia/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and also <a href="https://machinestudios.itch.io/maia" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Star Wars Dark Forces source port The Force Engine adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Force Engine is a free and open source game engine reimplementation for Star Wars Dark Forces, with upcoming support of Outlaws. The latest release version 1.08 adds Linux support!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2173915321675772984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2173915321675772984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's changed in the 1.08 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed "activated" to "toggle" to better match existing cheat messages.</li>
<li>Fixed a HOM issue in Executor.</li>
<li>Added a proper FPS counter which can be enabled in the graphics menu.</li>
<li>Renamed "energy" to "battery power".</li>
<li>Official Linux support added.</li>
<li>Updated the README with Linux build and run instructions.</li>
<li>Removed the unique 3DO model limit.</li>
<li>Fixed font rendering bugs (lack of language-specific symbols) due to using signed 8-bit characters instead of unsigned.</li>
<li>Dark Forces menu shortcuts now work correctly for different languages.</li>
<li>Fixed the Gamorrean Guard attack delay - they were attacking much more often than in vanilla.</li>
<li>Fixed the Sewer Creature attack and search delays, they were slightly longer than vanilla (meaning it attacked less often than it should have).</li>
<li>Midi selection in the Sound menu now works correctly.</li>
<li>The Escape menu now uses the correct palette, fixing issues with some languages and mods.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when a WAX did not have the appropriate animation in certain areas of the AI code.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it seems Linux users need to build it from source and the actual build instructions aren't in the readme, so I've asked if they can add more detailed instructions for people. Perhaps also someone can get it put up on <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> to make it even easier (and then get it simple on Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You do need the data files which you can get from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_dark_forces" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Space looter-shooter EVERSPACE 2 set to launch on April 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EVERSPACE 2 from ROCKFISH Games is ready to properly blast off on April 6th and it's looking mighty fine. I've been quite excited about seeing this one completed and I'll be taking a good look around the release or shortly after.</p>
<p>They've also said they're planning to release a free content update in the second half of 2023, and their team is also working on a major expansion for mid-2024. See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u8m47pGxGaM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea606059f206e0a9c60eeffbe5828351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u8m47pGxGaM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those of you waiting on the Native Linux version they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux (and Mac) support are still on track, with the aim to deliver this as close to the full release as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“EVERSPACE 2 has been, by far, our biggest and most ambitious project at ROCKFISH Games and a true labour of love over the five years it’s been in development, the last two of which in Early Access,” says ROCKFISH Games CEO Michael Schade. “With our release date revealed, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel where our amazing community and players all over the world new to the series will get to experience this adventure full of exciting, white-knuckle space combat and beautiful handcrafted deep space and planetside locations to explore. We’ve invested a hefty eight-digits budget into creating the game we’ve always wanted to make, and the team is now hard at work finaling and polishing all of our launch day content to perfection. Beyond the final chapter of the EVERSPACE 2’s story, there’s still a lot to see!”</p>
<p>While it's currently in Early Access, they will be raising the price. So if you've been after it waiting for the full release keep in mind the price will go up to $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99 on February 20th.</p>
<p>EVERSPACE 2 is currently available on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/everspace_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam and Steam Deck Beta fixes pages not rendering, plus GE-Proton 7-49 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out another small Beta update for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck that fixes some more annoying bugs. Changelog again the same across both, since it's mainly about New Big Picture Mode that Desktop and Steam Deck now share.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a cause of Steam library, chat and Big Picture Mode browser windows showing all black or not rendering.</li>
<li>Added fast jump by letter to the library.</li>
<li>Added settings for initial location to show keyboard on desktop and in Steam overlay.</li>

<li>Updated dxvk.</li>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 24: Mother Knows Best</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-23-ready-set-go/" target="_blank">Part 23: Ready, Set, Go!</a></strong></p>
<p>My mother's favourite game on Linux is without a doubt <em>Frozen Bubble</em>. It is a casual game in all of the best ways; one you can dive into and learn at your own pace thanks to its simple but repeatable formula. The stakes are never too high, with each level just being repeated until you beat it; the worst possible outcome being seeing a cartoon penguin cry over the fleeting loss of its igloo home. You will have them all jumping for joy again soon enough.</p>
<p>Searching online, I came across both the frozen-bubble-0.9.2-fr1.i386.rpm package alongside its perl-SDL-1.12-fr1.i386.rpm package dependency from freshrpms. I did try building the final 1.0.0 release from source, but it requires a newer version of SDL than is packaged for Red Hat Linux 7.3 which explains why no RPM packages were available. Consider this to be a snapshot in time back to 2002, from right before the game was to take the world by storm.</p>
<p>In terms of limitations it is hard to believe this was not the final release. The degree of polish on display with <em>Frozen Bubble</em> even at this early stage is already leagues ahead of most of its other contemporary free gaming fare. The game has its own unique identity, with a custom soundtrack, polar atmosphere, and recognizable characters. While the gameplay at its core may be a straight lift from <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, it is in the implementation that <em>Frozen Bubble</em> excels.</p>
<p>One complaint I did have with <em>Frozen Bubble</em> over the years is how the blue and purple bubbles, as well as the yellow and green bubbles, can look very much alike to someone who is colourblind like myself. It was not until I was consulting the changelog that I discovered that a special option was included which makes the bubbles also contain geometric shapes, activated using the -cb launch flag. This did not come until the following 0.9.3 release of the game.</p>
<p>While appreciated, this solution does still comes across as bit of an underexposed hack. The situation is still far better than what I encountered with <em>Theocracy</em>, where I missed spotting the Teotitlans entirely on the province view map, as their cyan colour code was almost indistinguishable to the beige given to neutral non-aligned provinces. Version 0.9.3 also has <em>Frozen Bubble</em> remember to ask for your high score after completing all 50 levels, about the only other complaint I had.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16386212461675316432gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16386212461675316432gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9582936901675318969gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9582936901675318969gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The milestone 1.0.0 release of <em>Frozen Bubble</em> in 2003 would expand the game to have 100 levels as well as retooling the graphics and including a built-in level editor. Following that, the game would be rebranded as <em>Frozen Bubble 2</em> starting with the 2.0.0 release in 2006, with the final stable 2.2.0 version coming out in 2008. <em>Frozen Bubble 2</em> features the ability to play multiplayer over the network, as well as showcasing brand new 3D assets created with Blender.</p>
<p>Some work would continue on the game up until 2010, but from there the project became dormant. It was never ported to SDL2 or had support added for widescreen or modern high definition displays. <em>Frozen Bubble</em> did see a number of forks to allow it to run in a web browser, with both a Java and JavaScript version being produced by Glenn Sanson. Considering how often the title is to this day held as a standard bearer of Linux gaming, an update does seem to be in order.</p>
<p>I would also tweak the game's difficulty curve just a little. While skill does play a role, often a successful play is dependent on the order of bubbles you get fed to your launcher. With luck some levels are made ridiculously easy, while others can be near impossible. As a veteran of the game, my mother agrees with me that level 70 as still featured in the final release can kill your momentum dead, and should at the very least be moved to be the ultimate level. Food for thought.</p>
<p>In the years following its release <em>Frozen Bubble</em> would stay the darling of Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards from a wide variety of Linux publications and websites, owing much to its wide demographic appeal. Consider how the lead developer Guillaume Cottenceau was inspired to start work on the game because he remembered how the original <em>Puzzle Bobble</em> was one of the few games he would play with his sister. Or how much my mother loves the game.</p>
<p>This also gave <em>Frozen Bubble</em> the distinction of being one of the oddest of <em>Quake</em> killers. With the exception of <em>XBill</em>, which I suspect garnered favour for political reasons, the Readers' Choice Awards for the <em>Linux Journal</em> magazine had always been dominated by <em>Quake</em> games. Then <em>Frozen Bubble</em> wins in 2003 and goes on to hold the "Best Linux Game" title for all of the next eight years surveyed. I, on the other hand, do still feel the urge to play <em>Quake</em> again.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 525.47.07 supports extension to help VKD3D-Proton DXR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like a future update of VKD3D-Proton that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, for Windows games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, will make use of a newer extension available in the new NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 525.47.07 release.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">release notes</a> for the new NVIDIA driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li>VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vulkan Video driver experiments:
<ul>
<li>Internally synchronize the picture VkVideoSessionParametersKHR while during parameter updates with vkUpdateVideoSessionParametersKHR</li>
<li>Allow for Picture Parameters like StdVideoH264PictureParameterSet, StdVideoH264SequenceParameterSet, StdVideoH265SequenceParameterSet, StdVideoH265PictureParameterSet and StdVideoH265VideoParameterSet to be optionally passed within vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR() and/or vkCmdDecodeVideoKHR() within VkVideoSessionParametersUpdateInfoKHR as an inlined extension structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Ignore VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo.pAttachments when all state is dynamic</li>
<li>Fix an issue with the video session picture parameters creation where the max PPS/SPS/VPS size is set to 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/525.47.07" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/525.47.07</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When you look into what that new extension does the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using pipeline libraries in ray tracing pipelines, a library might get linked into different pipelines in an incremental way. An application can have a strategy where a ray tracing pipeline is comprised of N pipeline libraries and is later augumented by creating a new pipeline with N + 1 libraries. Without this extension, all group handles must be re-queried as the group handle is tied to the pipeline, not the library. This is problematic for applications which aim to decouple construction of record buffers and the linkage of ray tracing pipelines.</p>
<p>To aid in this, this extension enables support for querying group handles directly from pipeline libraries. Group handles obtained from a library <strong>must</strong> remain bitwise identical in any <code class="inline-code">VkPipeline</code> that links to the library.</p>
<p>With this feature, the extension also improves compatibility with DXR 1.1 AddToStateObject(), which guarantees that group handles returned remain bitwise identical between parent and child pipelines. In addition, querying group handles from COLLECTION objects is also supported with that API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key point being the last paragraph, making it able to more closely match with DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) does. VKD3D-Proton added in support for it just <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commit/6f56e02354622b28041f8baaa2e201c950c0f7f5" target="_blank">recently</a> too. Seems like support for this extension is not yet in the Mesa drivers for Intel and AMD just yet.</p>

      <title>Gorgeous puzzler Bonfire Peaks getting a 3-part DLC starting March 2nd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best puzzle games to release back in 2021 and frankly it's criminally overlooked (only 140 use reviews on Steam?!), is set to get a whole lot bigger with the Lost Memories 3-part DLC. <em>The gorgeous blocky-voxel world with great lighting and bite-sized puzzles won me over easily.</em></p>
<p>The first part of this DLC releases March 2nd, and the developer said it's already around one quarter the size of the original game, so it's going to have quite a bit in it and the 2nd and 3rd parts are under development. Each part will bring entirely new puzzles and game mechanics to go along with it so it should be real interesting to see what they have cooking up.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C4aYKw0ae2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e07d8bc1d84e09f298009ba3a66a383.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C4aYKw0ae2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Created by Pipe Push Paradise and Hiding Spot developer Corey Martin, co-designed with Alan Hazelden (Draknek), and with art by Mari Khaleghi and Zach Soares. If you want a good puzzle game, look no further, seriously it's wonderful and you'll have a bit of time to complete it before the DLC releases.</p>
<p>The full game is currently available via <a href="https://coreymartin.itch.io/bonfire-peaks" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147890/Bonfire_Peaks/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Zero Wing, Twin Cobra and other Toaplan classics get upgraded for PC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>All your base are belong to us. Toaplan are having some absolute classics revived including Zero Wing, Out Zone, Twin Cobra and Truxton with a PC release and enhancements. Oh, and Native Linux support to ensure they're great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Working with Bitwave Games, they've confirmed to me Native Linux support is a go for the release on February 14 for all of the games in this first collection. Well, <em>Native</em> being an interesting word to use because it's clearly old games with emulation but you get the idea — they're ensuring it all works properly including the enhancements within it and it's all set up correctly.</p>
<p>Some true classics too! Zero Wing was one of the few full-games I had on SEGA Mega Drive when I was younger and that intro scene stuck with me forever.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AlNWV4QQYgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2fc4a952a76e0a3b6967ac4c1b189c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AlNWV4QQYgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the enhancements includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra customizable practice mode!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Superfluous Returnz is an unnecessary video game of a useless superhero</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>French comedy point and click adventure Superfluous Returnz is all about a useless superhero and it's releasing on May 15th. Coming with Native Linux support, I must admit one particular scene in the trailer made me laugh a bit, probably more than it should have.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this one, is that it has a free and open source game engine made for it too named <a href="https://framagit.org/Gee/sosage" target="_blank">Sosage</a> (Superfluous Open Source Adventure Game Engine).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8-ksx13Q84A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae9d0e5b0e77c5d62d80145a9b812f40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8-ksx13Q84A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The action takes place in Fochougny, a very quiet French village where billionaire Harpagon Lonion resides. He regularly disguises himself as Superfluous, a very useless superhero in such a peaceful countryside ...</p>
<p>Helped by his assistant Sophie, who tries to somehow temper the enthusiasm of his employer, he will try to apprehend the mysterious apple thief who is terrorizing the orchards of Fochougny ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Immerse yourself in a colorful universe in the style of a 2D cartoon.</li>
<li>Wander quietly through the village of Fochougny, an open world.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles, pick up items, combine them, talk to people from Fochougny to try to figure out what happened.</li>
<li>Play with the mouse in the best tradition of point-and-click games, or choose gamepad or keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Enjoy finely cut dialogues and omnipresent humor (the quality of the jokes is non-contractual).</li>
<li>Relax playing a game where you can't lose, die or get stuck (but where you can to tear your hair trying to solve some puzzles - hair implants are not provided).</li>
<li>Text dialogues available in English and French.</li>
</ul>

      <title>touchHLE is a new emulator for iPhone OS apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a way to emulate old Apple iOS apps and games? Well, <a href="https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE" target="_blank">touchHLE</a> just had its first release to prevent some more things being lost to time.</p>
<p>Platforms change and move on, often cutting off what came before. We've seen it time and time again with games consoles and with iOS being the closed platform it is plenty will get lost from it too. Perhaps not so much now if projects like touchHLE can keep advancing.</p>

<p>touchHLE is a high-level emulator (HLE) for iPhone OS apps. It runs on modern desktop operating systems, and is written in Rust.</p>
<p>As an HLE, touchHLE is radically different from a low-level emulator (LLE) like QEMU. The only code the emulated CPU executes is the app binary and a handful of libraries; touchHLE takes the place of iPhone OS and provides its own implementations of the system frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it doesn't seem to have fully working Linux support, and it has been a solo effort so far but now it has a release up and it's available on <a href="https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE" target="_blank">GitHub</a> I'm sure it won't be long until someone else hacks away at it to get Linux support into shape.</p>
<p>Right now their main goal for the project is to support the earlier days of iOS like iPhone OS 2.x and mainly later 32bit versions with modern 64bit apps a non-goal and unlikely to be prioritised due to the complexity of it.</p>

      <title>Open source Transport Tycoon Deluxe remake OpenTTD v13.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic free and open source game continues getting better, with the Transport Tycoon Deluxe remake OpenTTD version 13.0 out now. A business sim where you make money by  transporting passengers and cargo via road, rail, water, and air.</p>
<p>Only a few months since the last major update, it's nice to see development so active on a quality game! This is also one of the biggest updates they've done for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18777525491675686917gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18777525491675686917gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups.</li>
<li>Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window.</li>
<li>Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows.</li>
<li>NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list.</li>
<li>Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing.</li>
<li>Custom league tables for GameScripts.</li>
<li>More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream.</li>
<li>And much more including lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm definitely looking forward to the scaling options, now being on a 1440p monitor. </p>

      <title>Handshakes is a free sokoban puzzler about two hands meeting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes a good firm handshake is what's needed and someone decided to turn that idea into a free puzzle game with Handshakes.</p>
<p>Released back in January, this delightful little puzzler has 30 levels of arm-stretching that ranges from easy at the start up to palm-sweaty brain-teasingly difficult. Always playful though, I ended up cutting off one of my hands in some levels — woops. A genuine delight to randomly come across when looking for something new to play through. It won't take you too long to beat unless you're an idiot like me.</p>
<p>It's clever, because you're controlling multiple hands that need to meet, and you need to push boxes out of the way, open doors and more. Simple ideas but wonderfully made, what a gem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DO1U9nyjUqs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/966762e399571b94b9ebd648d1989540.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DO1U9nyjUqs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It gets a firm shake from me.</p>
<p><em>Lots of people seem to like this one too with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam!</em></p>
<p>Go shake some hands over on <a href="https://petpumpkin.itch.io/handshakes" target="_blank">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2171690/Handshakes/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>The developer is also making an expanded version now too named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2245130/Handshakes_Hands_On/" target="_blank">Handshakes: Hands On</a> that will have lots of new levels and plenty of new game mechanics to tickle those fingers with.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect: Jungle Pack releases soon with another free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox continue the DLC train here with Prison Architect: Jungle Pack announced for release on February 7th along with a free update for all players.</p>
<p>For the free update named The Jailhouse, they said it will include quality of life improvements including changes to guard behaviour, improvements to quick build materials, a small makeover of the deployment scheduler and the addition of Toby, a Yorkshire Terrier dog. The update also re-balances the Identity Thief reputation and other in-game effects.</p>
<p>As for the DLC here's what you can expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s a prison, in a jungle! - </strong>Enjoy some wooden furniture, five new flooring types (one specific for water!), one outdoor cinema plus new walls and doors: all is set to thrive in the jungle.</li>
<li><strong>Tropical fever (and how to survive it) - </strong>Tropical fever can spread among inmates. Luckily, you can fight and manage it with netted beds, fire pits, and a new, cutting-edge medical program.</li>
<li><strong>A different environment - </strong>In the jungle, you will find new trees, which you can farm and sell, or chop down for lumber. Some wood variants for guard towers, drains, etc. are also available.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Inspired by the classic SimTower, build up high with Property Pro</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Property Pro is an upcoming game from SimDevs, with an aim to capture the classic feel of SimTower from the 90s. With a hint of the character styling from Prison Architect and RimWorld, the idea sounds good.</p>
<p>You'll get to build a properly from scratch or purchase a used one, which may came with a whole bunch of hidden issues you need to deal with. Lots of different types of rooms to build, special guests, surprise inspects and many other challenges are planned to be included.</p>
<p>See some screenshots below, click them to make them bigger:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16210584961675428759gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16210584961675428759gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12879636771675428761gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12879636771675428761gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/SimDevs/status/1618340598624440322" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a child, I was captivated by SimTower even though I didn't fully understand how to play the #game. Now that I'm older, my goal is to recreate what it felt like playing the game from those cherished memories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>That really spoke to me, I remember enjoying what little of it I understood back then too…</em></p>
<p>Seems like it's worth keeping an eye on, if you love management style games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721000/Property_Pro/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support just like their previous game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/810590/Area_86/" target="_blank">Area 86</a>.</p>

      <title>Going to live my dream of Fifth Element flying cars in MiLE HiGH TAXi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic sci-fi movie Fifth Element? I sure do and I only watched it <em>again</em> recently, where memories came flowing back of how I used to want those flying cars. Well, one game developer clearly loved it too and they're soon releasing MiLE HiGH TAXi.</p>
<p>The developer mentions it shouldn't take players long to get to grips with the controls, and you can expect a "pulse-pounding ride" where you'll "encounter a cast of hilarious and chatty pedestrians, as well as impatient and over-the-top passengers" as you try to avoid all sorts of obstacles.</p>
<p>It's a mixture of Crazy Taxi, with mechanics inspired by Fifth Element and I honestly can't wait to try it out. Created by solo dev Cassius John-Adams, it's looking impressive as you'll see in the below trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xzs46WdaMkg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0a20d05eef4f561a76f6edaa9f54f23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xzs46WdaMkg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a few different game modes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In regular mode, strategize to pick up and drop off passengers in efficient ways, maximizing your earnings and extending your game time and career.</li>
<li>In Challenge mode, you'll face increasingly difficult challenges as you deliver passengers sequentially to level up.</li>
<li>In Free Roam mode, you'll be able to explore the city with no time limits or passenger pickups, discovering hidden shortcuts and other secrets as you go.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer plans to release it on March 13th, with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release.</p>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366560/MiLE_HiGH_TAXi/" target="_blank">on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio 29.0.1 is out now and a worthwhile upgrade for any of you doing video content on Linux, as it fixes many problems from the previous release.</p>
<p>Here's some Linux specific problems that were solved:</p>

<p>Are there any particular issues you're wanting to see solved? It seems the recent 29.0.0 release at least solved my audio sometimes being completely broken on recordings from USB capture so that's been a big improvement for me.</p>

      <title>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok is a Norse inspired horde survival rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok is yet another survivor game in the spirit of Vampire Survivors, except this has a Nordic theme to it and it's now on Steam with Native Linux support. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The developer sent a copy to my Steam Curator and I've been playing it a fair bit since I love these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a>, and being a huge <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Brotato</a> fan I was keen to see more variations on it. </p>
<p>Here it's has the similar mechanics of running around an arena, collecting things from enemies to level up and buffing up your character. However, unlike most others in the genre, it's not about building up a big assortment of weapons to unleash hell on your screen. Nordic Ashes is a bit more tame, with more of a focus on surviving and boosting your main weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21252723791675357208gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21252723791675357208gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Runs great out of the box on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>As you go through each map you level up, upgrade skills and when you die or finish a level there's some meta-progression to on the legendary Norse tree Yggdrasil but building that up can take quite a few hours of grindy gameplay. This is a lot more based on movement skill to avoid enemies and carefully picking your upgrades, compared with trying to be a truly overwhelming force like other similar titles where half the screen is covered by special effects. To some it might be better, but if you're really into the insane over-the-top action of the other titles this may not be for you. But for a somewhat slower and calmer experience it may be a good match.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the 9 Realms, each of them based on a world connected by Yggdrasil, the legendary Norse Tree.</li>
<li>Different characters, with exclusive abilities and weapons depending on their role.</li>
<li>Constellation Ability Trees to upgrade your survivor’s powers.</li>
<li>Design the most powerful builds.</li>
<li>Bosses with their own behaviours to make battles more epic.</li>
<li>Dozens of Relics to unlock.</li>
<li>Yggdrasil upgrades as a meta-progress.</li>
<li>Exclusive Early Access skins!</li>
<li>Play using mouse &amp; keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sports management / visual novel mash-up Roller Drama is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't play many visual novels (mostly a whole zero) but I do love when games sprinkle it in with other things like the sports management game Roller Drama. The game is certainly inspired and looks a lot like Roller Derby but it's not a simulator of it, and the actual gameplay is quite different according to the developer.</p>
<p>Set in a dystopian alternative world "where things are going… slightly worse than they are here", you watch as personal dramas rage on, manage matches and players and much more.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interactive narrative with meaningful choices (almost 100!) and multiple endings.</li>
<li>Vivid, explorable universe.</li>
<li>Replayable narrative and matches: every championship is unique, several different endings.</li>
<li>Replay a specific chapter.</li>
<li>Real-time roller derby matches.</li>
<li>Coach a team of five athletes with wildly different personalities.</li>
<li>Hand drawn character art by award winning illustrator Vic Macioci.</li>
<li>Play with controller or mouse + keyboard.</li>
<li>Cloud saves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with Native Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293420/Roller_Drama/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>While it is not yet Steam Deck Verified, the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1293420/view/3267948473375698907" target="_blank">worked</a> to ensure it plays well.</p>

      <title>Zoom Platform, a store aimed at &#39;Generation X&#39; adds more Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One I've been meaning to point out for a while now is <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/" target="_blank">Zoom Platform</a>. A games store that tries to appeal to "Generation X" with both new and classic games, DRM-free and they're continuing to build up their Linux support.</p>
<p>They don't have a whole lot available for Linux Native fans right now, with 26 titles currently tagged as supported including Sensible World of Soccer 96-97, Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition, Judge Dredd and more but they're continuing to build it up.</p>
<p>Recently they <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/new-updates-2023-01-07" target="_blank">updated</a> a bunch of Duke Nukem titles that use DOSBox, to work better with both the DOSBox and DOSBox-X flatpaks and over the last few months they've added more titles. Just recently, they also added Linux support for Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, noting on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZOOMPlatform/status/1620784072980299776" target="_blank">Twitter</a> a goal of theirs is to "support Linux as much as we can".</p>
<p>It's interesting to see a store that tries to appeal to the slightly older generation of gamers. As much as <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> tried to in the past, they've long since moved their focus much more onto modern releases. So perhaps some older readers might want to keep an eye on Zoom Platform.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress made over $7 million in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that's completely deserved of course. The Dwarf Fortress developers shared that the game made over $7,230,000 in January.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=181354.0" target="_blank">official forum</a> in their latest monthly report. They do make it clear, that they don't get to keep all of that as a bit less than half "will go to taxes" and they have to pay people, they have all the usual business expenses and so on but of course they will still get a lot of money from it overall. Enough that they've " solved the main issues of health/retirement that are troubling for independent people, as well as safeguarded the future of the game".</p>
<p>How much they made over the last few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>January: $7,230,123.58.</li>
<li>December: $15,635.07.</li>
<li>November: $14,071.27.</li>
<li>October: $15,374.72.</li>
<li>September: $14,679.51.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's amazing to see and fully deserved, this isn't exactly the kind of success a lot of indie teams can reproduce though. They have a lot of unique factors at play here including putting it out free for many years before their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Steam</a> release, which had numerous upgrades like the official graphics along with the health problems the developer faces which no doubt has spoke to hearts of many people.</p>
<p>If you've been playing it, how many hours have you sunk into it since the Steam release? It's playable with Proton but a Native Linux port is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/dwarf-fortress-releases-december-6-on-steam-and-itchio-native-linux-support-later/" target="_blank">planned</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD reveal prices and availability for Ryzen 7000X3D CPU series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has now revealed how much you can expect to be poorer by when picking up one of the new 7000X3D CPUs, along with release dates. The details were announced on Twitter and are:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Available February 28</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 9 7950X3D - $699</li>
<li>Ryzen 9 7900X3D - $599</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Available April 6</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 7 7800X3D - $449 </li>
</ul>
<p>Good news for those of you with an up to date motherboard too, as AMD continue to mention how it's a drop-in replacement for AM5 motherboards with a BIOS update so no need to go out and buy another board. When it comes to cooling, they recommend at least a 280mm all-in-one liquid cooler for the best performance. </p>
<p>They also released a video about it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FLxH9ivPWUI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/119109261dbe7dbb581ea19c71c62a0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FLxH9ivPWUI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I really absolutely don't <em>need</em> one since I have an AMD Ryzen 5800X but I sure do <em>want</em> one. </p>

      <title>Ubisoft just broke their games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 21:17</strong>: Looks like Proton developers have updated the "bleeding-edge" Beta for Proton Experimental, that works around the issue. Note: using it can cause other issues, the Beta doesn't have a lot of testing, you've been warned.</p>
<p>If you go into the Properties on Proton Experimental in your Steam Library, and opt into the "bleeding-edge" Beta, then set your Ubisoft games to use Proton Experimental it will fix it for now until a proper Proton update is out. </p>
<p><strong>Update 22:11</strong>: Valve released a Proton Experimental (no Beta needed) fix for this.</p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below</em></u></p>
<p>Third-party launchers on Steam are once again being a massive nuisance. First it was EA breaking everything on Linux and Steam Deck and now it's Ubisoft telling everyone to hold their beer.</p>
<p>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/proton-experimental-upgraded-to-fix-the-ea-app-failing-to-update-on-steam-deck-a-linux/" target="_blank">fixed the EA App</a> in Proton after a while, and it's likely we're going to need to wait on a fix from Valve again for whatever Ubisoft changed in the latest Ubisoft Connect update.</p>
<p>When you go to launch any game on desktop Linux or Steam Deck that uses Ubisoft Connect, it will do an update and then you'll be greeted with this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5117776381675266378gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5117776381675266378gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>That picture above is from my Fedora Linux desktop trying Ghost Recon Breakpoint today.</p>
<p>After testing The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Ghost Recon Breakpoint on my Steam Deck too, they all also gave the exact same problem as you'll see in the screenshot below from my Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7110715951675266489gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7110715951675266489gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So it seems that every title that uses Ubisoft Connect, is now left broken on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. This comes only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">two weeks after</a> Ubisoft fixed The Division 2 for Steam Deck / Linux. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Breakpoint still needs manual fixes</a>.</p>
<p>Why do developers and publishers keep forcing these absolutely useless third-party launchers on us? Never once have I, or anyone I've spoken to, actually wanted them. They only ever cause problems and solve basically nothing that Steam cannot already do directly.</p>
<p>I've logged an official <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6498" target="_blank">bug report</a> with Valve and notified their developers about it.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix change has just been deployed to fix an issue where the Dead Space save screen thumbnail wouldn't appear properly. We're not aware of any remaining issues with the game but are continuing to monitor reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet asking for clarification Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1620587750587252736" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of those changes were improvements to our DX12 implementation to better support usage patterns we hadn't seen before.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, the 1991 classic from Nintendo has been reverse-engineered to bring it natively to more platforms. Nintendo are no doubt warming up their lawyers. Available on <a href="https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the MIT license, it notes the game is fully playable from start to finish and it does need the original ROM for the resources, so it doesn't include the copyrighted assets.</p>
<p>Some extra features were added too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for pixel shaders.</li>
<li>Support for enhanced aspect ratios of 16:9 or 16:10.</li>
<li>Higher quality world map.</li>
<li>Support for MSU audio tracks.</li>
<li>Secondary item slot on button X (Hold X in inventory to select).</li>
<li>Switching current item with L/R keys.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like it's supported to run it across Linux, macOS and Windows too!</p>

      <title>elementary OS 7 &#39;Horus&#39; is out now with major AppCenter upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>elementary OS, probably one of the absolutely slickest looking Linux distributions around, has released version 7 with some major upgrades.</p>
<p>According to the Founder and CEO, Danielle Foré, the previous release saw downloads hit over 400,000 and that's not counting third-party downloads or torrents that don't use their downloads page. Some impressive numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20058983841675254487gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20058983841675254487gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>elementary OS 7 saw a lot of working going into the AppCenter, their first-party application for installing and updating software. It's quite unique, as it offers developers a pay what you want model to put up applications for users, something they seem to be quite successful with.</p>
<p>The new release overhauls the likes of app descriptions, easier updates, upgrades to side-loading and alternate stores, improved responsiveness of the AppCenter itself, rewritten navigation and lots more. One major change is how they handle installing from other sources, instead of showing a warning message it will now show the app in AppCenter with a clear icon and note that it's not curated by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17022305351675254762gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17022305351675254762gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME Web 43 with support for creating web apps.</li>
<li>Big improvements to their Feedback app to make it easier to use.</li>
<li>A simpler to use OS installer with less screens to click through.</li>
<li>Their onboarding welcome app now lets you configure automatic updates.</li>
<li>Their email app Mail now has a "more-modern, flatter design" as a final step to make it more responsive.</li>
<li>A redesign of Printer settings.</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of their Music app.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers noted performance has been a focus for this release too and in "just about every section" they could have written about performance. They've spent a fair amount of time looking into slowdowns, reworking old code and optimizing everything they possibly could.</p>
<p>Lots more in the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/os-7-available-now/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Really looking good! I've always been impressed by the design of elementary OS 7.</p>

      <title>Budgie 10.7 sounds like a great desktop to use on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Budgie 10.7 is out now, refreshing many parts of this Linux desktop environment to improve the UI across many parts. Originally created for the Solus Linux distribution, nowadays it lives as an independent project and continues to impress.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot new including an application indexer that should be more reliable, Budgie Desktop Settings has a new design for widget selection and Budge Menu saw quite a few improvements like: gaining support for dual-GPUs to pick the right one, a personal user menu giving you quick access to folders like Home and Documents, quick-access buttons at the bottom things like Desktop Settings and Power and the Budgie Menu also no longer needs to reload when the application index changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875362121675253239gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875362121675253239gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Budgie Run Dialog uses their new application indexer.</li>
<li>A new Budgie Screenshot application built into the desktop.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements to the notification system, like showing you a summary of notifications after using something in fullscreen. Their notification system also now supports more of the FreeDesktop Notification spec.</li>
<li>Raven, their big panel on the right, now has a whole new widget API system so anyone can build their own widgets for Raven. Plus there's upgrades to multiple existing Raven widgets like a new Usage Monitor giving you a minimal look at CPU, RAM and Swap use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots more can be found in the <a href="https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-7-released/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>I've never actually used Budgie myself, and going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics/" target="_blank">our user stats</a> not a whole lot of people do that filled in their PC Info. If you do use it — what attracts you to it compared with the likes of GNOME, KDE, Xfce and so on?</p>

      <title>Colossal Cave returns from the 1970s in a 3D reimagining</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Colossal Cave, originally released in 1977 from Will Crowther and Don Woods has been revived and reimagined for modern audiences. Another one for a heavy dose of nostalgia perhaps? This new version comes from Sierra On-Line founders Ken and Roberta Williams.</p>
<p>While the original was a text-based adventure, this new version gives it a full 3D look while still aiming to be faithful to what the original game represented. With the non-linear exploration system, you will decide on how to proceed through it and discover the many secrets hiding.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CsGwtyaKBZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/848a9b09f047902c44405de2c72e5981.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CsGwtyaKBZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Scenic landscapes with hidden secrets.</li>
<li>Miles of caves, caverns, and crawl to work your way through. With over 15 distinct areas to explore in the Colossal Cave.</li>
<li>Difficult puzzles for those seeking a challenge.</li>
<li>Over 20 individual achievements to find and accomplish.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The original Colossal Cave Adventure was truly unlike anything anyone had seen before, and we hope to make a similar mark on the next generation,” says Roberta Williams, Founder and Lead Designer, Cygnus Entertainment. “Ken and I would have never thought this game could be the experience we’ve created today, but we’ve made that dream a reality thanks to a lot of love and hard work from us, our team, and our gracious partners.”<br/>
 <br/>
“Colossal Cave is a game with a long history, and as we got deeper into the project we realized that our Sierra heritage as well as the game's history were a powerful combination,” says Ken Williams, Founder and CEO, Cygnus Entertainment. “When we began this project we received overwhelming support from every direction because of what this game ment to an entire generation. We’ve had the fortune to watch kids and adults alike enjoying the game just as we did all those years ago, and we can’t wait to bring it to all of our fans today!”</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215540/Colossal_Cave/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>The PR mail said it would be on Humble and itch.io too but it does not seem live on either.</em></p>

      <title>Inspired by Boulder Dash and Supaplex, Gem Worlds is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh the nostalgia is heavy with this one! Gem Worlds is inspired directly by the likes of Boulder Dash and Supaplex. I didn't play either, but it's also very similar to one I did play and LOVED on Amiga called Emerald Mine.</p>
<p>This will be something of an acquired taste I think, more for my older readers, since it's not especially flashy but plays on nostalgia from the classics and I love to cover everything from tiny solo games to the latest AAA as long as they could be interesting. I also spent far too many days inside playing the likes of Emerald Mine.</p>
<p><em>Have a little look at the trailer below:</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hxtclWR-yQM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/171787657cf29380f2b907b0745291a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hxtclWR-yQM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore 50 uniquely-generated levels across 5 unique worlds.</li>
<li>Collect gems, dodge boulders, escape to survive.</li>
<li>Fight monsters (or avoid them) using melee or a variety of skills.</li>
<li>Unlock and upgrade more than 10 diverse skills as the game progresses.</li>
<li>Exploit biome-specific obstacles including mines, icicles, cactii, and more.</li>
<li>3+ hours of play time.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SurrounDead looks like a mix of DayZ and Project Zomboid</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's early days for the game yet with it in Early Access but SurrounDead could be a promising one to play online with some friends.</p>
<p>From the description and footage shown from the developer, it looks like an odd blending of DayZ and Project Zomboid. However, it also seems to be heavily inspired by another called DeadPoly which is lesser known than the two aforementioned bigger games but if you've seen that you'll know what to expect.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jP121rIaaQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4849daf089fbd9ede70cb8e0bea0d9bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jP121rIaaQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes this different then? Why am I mentioning it? Well, I initially thought it actually had a Native Linux version whereas DeadPoly does not. It has the SteamOS icon on Steam but checking SteamDB, there's no Linux content or launch configuration. Only after I checked the system requirements, did I spot something that's somewhat unique, as it directly lists Proton for Linux as what they support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8549866651675182317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8549866651675182317gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It might not exactly be the first time, my memory escapes me on who did it first, but it's in the single digits on the number of developers noting support being official for Proton in this way so I thought it was interesting to highlight.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Travel through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape.</li>
<li>Fight zombies and possibly worse.</li>
<li>Find many different firearms, melee weapons and equipment.</li>
<li>Trade with survivors in trader hideouts or safe zones to get that one piece of equipment you need.</li>
<li>Barricade buildings or find your self somewhere in the wilderness to escape to.</li>
<li>Loot varied locations to improve yourself, but be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Weather and day/night cycles, be careful.</li>
<li>Manage your stats to stay alive.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free strategy shooter game Unvanquished v0.54 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free, open source and full of bugs (the squishable kind) — Unvanquished is a mixture of strategy and an FPS with a new release v0.54 out now. Unvanquished is a fork of Tremulous, for those don't know it's similar in style to Natural Selection with aliens versus humans fighting it out with each having a little base to build.</p>
<p>This release brings with it official ARM support for Linux, so you can now play Unvanquished on your Raspberry Pi and many other ARM systems. Some of course might be too slow but it also means you can now run a server for it on ARM too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9447110311675181444gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9447110311675181444gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Unvanquished v0.54 screenshot.</em></p>
<p>More polishing work went into the UI this time around too with the map load screen now showing the map name and author name and map authors can be a little creative with the level shots now too. On top of the modded servers can also be a little more creative, as they can have their own welcome screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17000929741675180516gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17000929741675180516gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Welcome screen example shot.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of online play, the developers improved colour code support for things like usernames, so it doesn't count towards the character count limit.</p>
<p>Other improvements include an update to the lucifer cannon model, there's no negative momentum anymore impacting players as the game goes on, rockets no longer follow dead players and a bug affecting Marauder zap chains is fixed. There's also a bunch of new icons , spectator mode fixes and numerous fixes to bots to improve how they play so they should actually be a bit more menacing and fun to play against. Bot navigation got the biggest upgrade, with their navigation mesh (what they use to pathfind) now being generated in-game solving many problems.</p>
<p>Plenty of changes to the graphics rendering was added like the ability to disable light styles, files for optional features when disabled are no longer loaded, serious issues with dynamic lights were solved along with many crash bugs being fixed.</p>
<p><em>Seems like 2023 is going to be a good year for Unvanquished.</em></p>

<p class="plain-list-title">One day this year, I really hope I get to excitedly write about how either Valve or NVIDIA fix the terrible performance of the New Big Picture Mode on Desktop. Apparently one does not simply <s>walk into Mordor</s> make it work well. I'm sure if it was easy, it would have been sorted by now.</p>

      <title>Forspoken gets an update to improve Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/" target="_blank">Forspoken</a> has been controversial for quite a lot of a reasons but also a title many were looking forward to. The release was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/forspoken-desktop-linux-spoof-steam-deck/" target="_blank">bit rough</a> but the developers are cleaning it up now and it has some Steam Deck fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adjustments have been made to HDR mode.</li>
<li>Localization and spelling fixes.</li>
<li>Various minor fixes.</li>
<li>Certain technical issues occurring on Steam Deck has been fixed.</li>
<li>Performance and stability has been improved on Steam Deck.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing to see games from publishers like Square Enix pay attention to a Linux gaming device, we're going to see a lot more of this over the next year. Although, it would be great if developers did these things before release, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-in-stock-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-taiwan/" target="_blank">roll-out of the Steam Deck in Asia</a> going strong, there's going to be a lot more people using it now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8463547201675173182gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8463547201675173182gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I still personally think £64.99 is a crazy price for it, so I won't be going into any depth on it myself. It currently has a Mixed user rating on Steam from over 2,000 people and the peak player count dropped pretty harshly quickly after release so it's not exactly popular.</p>
<p>They did update the demo too, so for those of you who wish to try it out that might give you a good idea now.</p>

      <title>AMD GPU driver on Linux and Steam Deck to get big improvement on stuttering problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work to improve gaming performance on Steam Deck and Linux desktops for AMD GPUs is always ongoing, and it seems we're set for another nice improvement to how smooth games are.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems is shader compile stutter, where you play through a game first-time and see it stuttering about all over the place until the shaders get built. It's less of a problem in plenty of games if Valve have them ready for download but that's not always possible, and doesn't always solve it. Some games also update a lot and need shader cache updates often, this will again help with those times where it’s not yet available. For games not on Steam, it will also be a huge bonus win for performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a> released back in November 2022 included some major changes to work around it, and work is ongoing in the AMD GPU driver RADV to make use it what's needed. Later NVIDIA drivers have it and the improvements there are quite impressive but the current experimental work in the AMD GPU driver needed work.</p>
<p>As Valve contractor Mike Blumenkrantz <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/through-the-loop/" target="_blank">blogged about</a> recently going over work they and others have done regarding the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library Vulkan API extension, and the blog post is well worth a read for some background into it but to cut to the chase — the result of the work is a "50,000%" improvement in fast-linking which for <em>gamers</em> should result in a much improved experience for certain games.</p>
<p>The work should hopefully come in Mesa 23.1 due later this year where use of the noted Vulkan extension above should hopefully be turned on by default, and then for Steam Deck players specifically hopefully in something like SteamOS 3.5.</p>
<p>This and more was covered in my recent video:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 23: Ready, Set, Go!</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-22-happy-hacking/" target="_blank">Part 22: Happy Hacking</a></strong></p>
<p>If you look at the commercial Linux gaming catalogue at the turn of the millennium, in amongst all of the 3D shooters and strategic simulations being released, one glaring omission seems to have been the lack of any racing games. Loki Software never ported any to Linux, nor did any of the other porting houses. This left a void for the free gaming community to fill. One of the first be off to the races was <em>Trophy</em>, whose development started in March 2000.</p>
<p>The latest version of <em>Trophy</em> I can run from Red Hat Linux 7.3 is version 1.1.3 from before the game was ported to ClanLib 0.8 and beyond. To do this, I first had to grab the ClanLib-0.6.1-fr1.i386.rpm, ClanLib-sound-0.6.1-fr1.i386.rpm, and Hermes-1.3.2-fr3.i386.rpm pacakges from freshrpms. Even then, the included binary that came bundled with the 1.1.3 source tarball would still not load, as it was built against libstdc++5 which is too new.</p>
<p>This is the same problem I had when attempting to launch later versions of <em>Cube</em>, but since I could satisfy all the other build dependencies in this case, I was able to compile my own binary linked to my older version of glibc. To do this, all I had to do was run "make clean" followed by "make" in the trophy directory. This did mean I also had to install all of the ClanLib and Hermes development packages, which from freshrpms came to a whopping eleven packages in total.</p>
<p>Even then the game window still came up labelled as "Trophy 1.0.6" instead, but both the "Snake" and "Rally" tracks were present and correct, so I know I built the right version. Beyond that the only other bug I encountered was that I was unable to change the colour of my car using the arrow keys as the menu suggests, with the new game screen only seeming to allow me to input my name. That said, I am also unsure what the "Hall Of Fame" is even for at this point.</p>
<p><em>Trophy </em>is a top down racer which distinguishes itself by having an emphasis on using extras such as vehicular combat to get ahead of your rivals. You can fire a machine gun at other cars by pressing the "x" key, drop bombs with the "c" key, and give yourself a turbo boost by holding down the "a" key. All of these are powered by collectibles found scattered about the track, right up until you finish the fifth and final lap. The result is a strong arcade feel without being a kart racer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14509378931674772712gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14509378931674772712gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2622579241674772713gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2622579241674772713gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The graphics are appealing if a little compressed, with the tracks themselves being large for the time 1200x1200px bitmaps created in several layers through use of the GNU Image Manipulation Program. In fact, an entire track designer manual was written that goes over the process of building a track, all to encourage <em>Trophy </em>players to make a submit their own creations. This manual can still be read from the <em>Trophy </em>website hosted on SourceForge.</p>
<p>Work on <em>Trophy</em> advanced in fits in starts, with the latest 2.0.4 release from 2019 still depending on the ancient ClanLib 1.0 software development kit. But while <em>Trophy</em> ossified from a technical perspective over the last decade or so, the gameplay became deeply enriched starting with the 2.0.0 release. This was the first to feature a championship mode as well as a shop where you can buy vehicle upgrades and new cars, giving the money you collect a real purpose at long last.</p>
<p>With all of these additions in particular, <em>Trophy</em> reminds me very much of <em>Mini-Car Racing</em> as published by eGames, one of my brother's favourite games growing up. Whether this a coincidence or not is hard to say, as both games first released in the same year, but they do both have you race on the moon. <em>Mini-Car Racing</em>, incidentally, is also one of many older games which are far easier to get working with WINE than on modern versions of Windows today.</p>
<p>Looking at the TODO list included alongside <em>Trophy </em>shows that<em> </em>the similarities were planned to go even deeper than that, with the inclusion of oil slicks, rockets, and jump points on the tracks. All of which compounds the feeling that <em>Trophy</em> does still have a great deal of unfulfilled potential, with networked multiplayer also having been mooted at one point. There is a legacy here that would be great for someone to build upon, should the right contributor be found.</p>
<p>Which free and open source game projects take off and which stagnant often seems to be at the gift of chance, but at least here there is always the option that some new life can be breathed into them, if given enough interest. The same can even be said for what is to this day my mother's favourite computer game, a free software title which for most of the 2000s was one of the most lauded Linux games to ever be released for the platform.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns gets an update to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns is a great strategy game from the developer of XCOM, and now it should actually much better on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Two major problems were broken Cloud Saves and a crash for plenty of people at certain points, with both now hopefully solved! Always nice to see such major titles getting some special attention for my favourite gaming platform and the stability fixes specifically should also help players on Linux desktop too!</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/368260/view/3678912721785348966" target="_blank">update</a> they noted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>General performance improvements</li>
<li>General stability fixes</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Virtual Keyboard fixes</li>
<li>Steam/Deck/Link save fixes, including cloud syncing</li>
<li>Steam Deck stability fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see my previous video on the game below:</p>

<p>Definitely looking forward to playing more of it, although I really hate that it has micro-transactions, that still feels gross. They already have a Season Pass, which actually gives you everything extra with the micro-transactions to buy extras individually, it just feels completely stupid to have both and confuse players. Aside from that, I don't have a lot to complain about, the battles are a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Deadpool just arrived recently too:</p>

      <title>Slavic fantasy-adventure The End of the Sun gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for something just a bit different? The End of the Sun is a Slavic-fantasy adventure and you can try it out now. At release it will have Native Linux support and the demo has a Linux version ready too.</p>
<p>About the game: "The End of the Sun is a first-person exploration and adventure story-based game, set in the world of Slavic rites, beliefs and legends. The small village becomes a place of mysterious events, through which the line between myth and reality begins to fade perilously. As the ashter (Slavic sorcerer) who is gifted with the ability to travel in time and knowledge about Navia (the otherworld where human fates shape), following the trail of the unusual fugitive, you come to a mysterious village. Unfortunately, you cannot find anyone there, at least not in a way you expected to. All you can see around are burned hearths."</p>
<p>The developers say you can expect around an hour gameplay from the demo, with English and Polish full audio with 9 languages planned for the full release that will be sometime in Q4 2023.</p>
<p>You can see their new teaser below:</p>

      <title>Adventure puzzler Myst now Steam Deck Verified, will adjust graphics automatically</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Myst, the remake of the 1993 classic, has been updated and is now Steam Deck Verified so you can go and get as confused as I was by it. I've not played the 2021 remake myself but it sure does look good, and I have some fond memories of trying to figure out the original.</p>
<p>The latest update to the game notes full Steam Deck support with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features </p>
<ul>
<li>Myst will now autodetect to optimal graphics settings when playing on Steam Deck for the first time (this will not affect games that are streamed to Steam Deck; it only affects game instances from installations on the Steam Deck itself). Autodetect can be used in the graphics settings menu to bring you back to these optimal settings on the Steamdeck version of Myst at any time.</li>
<li>Updated credits localization for a few members.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Spoiler, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">(SPOILER) Fix for a little piece of Atrus’ hair floating away from his head while in D’ni.</div>
</details>
</li>
<li>Fix for player height being a bit off in VR when descending some ladders around Myst, regardless of Quick Travel On Ladders enabled or not.</li>
<li>Fix for “(Restart Needed)” showing up next to the ray tracing option if you simply auto detect your graphics settings in the graphics settings menu, without modifying the ray tracing setting at all.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-48 out now with updates to DXVK, VKD3D-Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-48" target="_blank">GE-Proton v7-48</a>, the community supported version of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> translation layer, is out now with upgrades to various components to continue making Steam Deck and Linux gaming better.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated proton-wine bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk.</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>These are all the various components that translates Windows API calls to something Linux understands, and the parts that translates Direct3D to Vulkan.</em></p>
<p>The developer notes it also includes fixes for Dead Space thanks to pulling in the latest work for each of the above.</p>
<p>On top of that it's noted that a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/8153" target="_blank">problem</a> with Monster Hunter: Rise is actually a graphics driver issue for the AMD RADV driver, which has fix <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20941" target="_blank">pending</a>. So the fix for that is expected in a future Mesa driver release.</p>
<p>Here's an example guide on installing GE-Proton</p>

      <title>Valve fixed up Dead Space on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you waiting for news on Dead Space becoming more playable on Steam Deck — Valve have already delivered.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/the-new-dead-space-is-sadly-a-great-big-mess-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">original article and video</a>, it was an example of just how bad some brand new releases can be, especially when they don't have a shader cache built up for it. Thankfully, Valve apparently continue burning the midnight oil on weekends to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> fixed up.</p>
<p>Not only have they put up an <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1619247174965137409" target="_blank">initial</a> shader cache now, they've also <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1619377996615528448" target="_blank">updated</a> Proton Hotfix to work around the map crashing the game and even included a little performance fix too. The result of all of that together is quite amazing compared with how it was at release.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="liIh1i7vE1E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9be5baf5ba3c600041cda43290c07a79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/liIh1i7vE1E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Don't go expecting perfection though just yet of course, it’s a brand new big budget title and there may be some lingering issues as Valve is reacting quickly as the problems appear but their dedication to it is truly admirable. Shows how much they care about their players having a good experience, even for titles that haven't been through Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Great work Valve. Hopefully one day we won't have to wait around for shaders to get sorted. Developers using the Vulkan API would be a good start.</p>
<p><em>Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow me on YouTube</a> for more videos.</em></p>
<p>For Linux <em>desktop</em> players curious on how it runs: after allowing Steam time to sort shader pre-caching (which took quite a while — and froze Steam completely at one point). Running it on Fedora Linux 37 with an NVIDIA 2080Ti and an AMD Ryzen 5800X, it does work out of the box.</p>
<p>It still needed about 1 minute for the <em>in-game</em> shader loading before the intro logo screens. From there, it also gave the freezing issue on the loading screens the Steam Deck originally saw but after about 30 seconds that went to the menu just fine. </p>
<p>Performance can be problematic though even on desktop, as there's plenty of shader stuttering and the intro scene in the ship had at least one full freeze for a good few seconds still. So while the shader system works great for the Steam Deck, desktop Linux is obviously a whole range of hardware combinations so it's not as easy for Valve to sort. Thankfully, desktops generally have a <em>lot</em> more power to push through the shader spikes but even so, repeatedly stuttering and multi-second <em>freezing</em> when it loads new sections in is not great. Hopefully Valve have more VKD3D-Proton performance improvements coming for desktop.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and Steam Beta fix on-screen keyboard, Gyro improvements, Linux input fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies coming to the Steam Deck and Steam Desktop Beta, as Valve sure do like to work quickly to solve bugs and add features. Once again a lot is shared between the two but there are some differences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard not visible in-game when opened with gamepad</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Calibration UI: Gyro rotation readings are displayed to help diagnose drift issues.</li>
<li>Autocalibration of Gyro Drift has been reworked. After the initial calibration, setting down a controller on a stable surface silently recalculates drift compensation within a few seconds. Movement Threshold values can be manually tweaked - useful if you notice drift re-appear when the controller is in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Deck Desktop / New Big Picture Mode / Overlay</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam Chat window scaling</li>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard windows refusing to close</li>
<li>Fixed regression where some Remote Play Together dialogs no longer worked</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for Linux desktop, Valve also solved this issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed keyboard input to Steam menus on Linux</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659772423367878641" target="_blank">Desktop changelog</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3635002625415252852" target="_blank">Steam Deck changelog</a>.</p>
<p>What are you current most wanted fixes?</p>
<p>For me, I really want them to figure out what's causing the New Big Picture Mode to perform so poorly on Linux. It's pretty much unusable with NVIDIA.</p>

      <title>Watch Dogs: Legion from Ubisoft arrives on Steam, playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's yet another Steam release from Ubisoft, as they continue dumping their older titles on Steam. Watch Dogs: Legion is here and playable on Steam Deck. We've already had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/immortals-fenyx-rising-now-on-steam-but-quite-messy-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Immortals Fenyx Rising</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-impressive-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/trackmania-steam-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Trackmania</a> on the way soon too. Clearly, Ubisoft want the Steam monies.</p>
<p>The good news with Watch Dogs: Legion is that it doesn't put up much of a fuss on Steam Deck. Much like previous Ubisoft release there's no real Steam integration so no Steam Achievements, and once again it has Denuvo Anti-Tamper so if you keep changing Proton versions for testing and / or keep swapping between machines, it might eventually lock you out for 24 hours if you've done it too much (very annoying).</p>
<p>Apart from that, it's pretty smooth sailing in terms of how stable it is but performance like a lot of open-world games needs you locking it to 30FPS because it cannot keep a stable 40. I tested between DirectX 11 and DirectX 12, with DirectX 12 clearly being a lot smoother overall.</p>

      <title>The new Dead Space is sadly a great big mess on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> got a remake that was released today and I was <em>incredibly</em> excited by it but sadly it's just a mess. Not the game story, graphics or anything like that but specifically the performance on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The publisher and developer haven't said it's supported, and Valve haven't given it a Deck Verified rating but many were no doubt like me and very keen to play it. There's numerous problems with it that I'm going to explain and some of them will no doubt get fixed up over the next couple of weeks through performance patches to the game, and with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> updates I expect to come as well.</p>
<p>Trying with both Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix (that's the default set by Valve for it), it's no different between them. This is also installed on the Steam Deck's SSD, just to rule out any SD Card issues as I wanted to be sure on that too. <em>The game does warn you it's designed for SSDs and it even claims users on plain HDDs may see errors.</em></p>
<p>From massive loading spikes, that will often completely freeze the Steam Deck, to issues causing the Steam Deck to reboot, it's full of problems. Some will be improved when it has a full shader cache, while others will need a Proton update. Trying to look at the map, for example, will hard-crash the game and lose your progress every time. Even if you struggle a bit through the great many massive performance drops to get it to perform better later on thanks to some shaders being built up, the map crash and Steam Deck reboots (same happens in God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Breakpoint) just make it unplayable. Even when some shaders are built, plenty of areas will also still just drop performance hard with stutters to load it all.</p>
<p>See a video below highlighting just how bad the first couple runs are:</p>

<p><strong>Update 28/01/23</strong>: I've <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6486#issuecomment-1407385214" target="_blank">provided</a> Valve with multiple crash-log files on the issues. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck now in stock across Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Komodo PR sent word that there's no longer a reservation queue to purchase a Steam Deck across Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Originally, much like the western launch of the Steam Deck, you had to wait in queue until it was your turn to purchase due to stock levels. Now, that's mostly no longer the case. The only one that isn't in stock is the 64GB model specifically in Japan, where Komodo said it was "backordered at this time" so it's obviously been a bit too popular there.</p>
<p>Komodo states they've seen "high demand", and the official Docking Station is still in a reservation queue for Japan and Taiwan but is in stock for Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases an in-stock item will have it shipped within two weeks of the purchase, while out of stock in the reservation queue will be filled as "quickly as possible" with emails inviting you to purchase going as soon as they're available in the order reservations were made.</p>
<p>You can order a Steam Deck from Valve's partner <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">Komodo</a> across Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Nice to see that the Asian markets are reacting well to the Steam Deck, let's hope it keeps up so more people can appreciate just how good Linux can be for gaming. I expect this year we will see Valve announce new regions too, further expanding the reach of the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>The overlooked gorgeous pixel-art Lila&#39;s Sky Ark is now on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fresh chance for me to tell you to take a look at the overlooked gem that is Lila's Sky Ark, as it's now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/lilas_sky_ark" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? The second game from Monolith of Minds who first gave us the action-adventure <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/resolutiion-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Resolutiion</a>. Technically this game is Resolutiion's prequel story, not that you need to know that as it's entirely standalone. Lila's psychedelic world is in grave danger. Help her and her eccentric friends stop the Conductor’s minions from destroying all things musical and magical in this meditative action-adventure game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B98fLZUfsIM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/326d15cc4e355c6cbb57dc26ed7a8656.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B98fLZUfsIM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore Lila's pyschedlic world and get to know her quirky cast of friends, such as the fantastically bespectacled Doctor-Father-Sir and the raven shopkeepers.</li>
<li>Search this groovy dreamscape for hidden secrets, recipes, and even new glasses for a certain Sir.</li>
<li>Unravel Lila's puzzle-like story, which explores themes such as loss, loneliness, grief, and depression, in this moving prequel to Resolutiion.</li>
<li>Battle music-inspired enemies and punishing bosses using an array of strange weapons unlocked through alchemy recipes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Released originally back in April 2022, amongst many other fantastic titles it was completely overlooked by most with only 67 user reviews on Steam (and only 8 of those gave it a thumbs down).</p>
<p>Now you can grab it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/lilas_sky_ark" target="_blank">GOG</a> on top of <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lilas-sky-ark?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1573390/Lilas_Sky_Ark/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Trackmania heads to Steam and the devs say it&#39;s playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackmania, the 2020 remake, is heading to Steam and the developers have started answering questions like — will it run on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>Even more Ubisoft coming back to Steam, what a treat. Following on from earlier Steam releases of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/immortals-fenyx-rising-now-on-steam-but-quite-messy-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Immortals Fenyx Rising</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-impressive-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>. From Ubisoft Nadeo, it will be free to play when it hits Steam on February 2nd, so you can bet I'll be giving it to a go so you know what to expect on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Speaking on Twitter in their thread answering questions, they mentioned about the Steam Deck: "2. Can I play Trackmania with my Steam Deck? We are still waiting for the official review for Steam Deck from Valve to know if it is possible. From our tests, the game is playable on the device.". Nice to see some more official testing being done! Would be good to see more of that from Ubisoft and others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yjmzsOOrEnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c377f22ad7f0c3a5225ceba3a804e995.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yjmzsOOrEnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2225070/Trackmania/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Why are Ubisoft coming back to Steam? The answer is clear: money talks. Ubisoft want more of it, and clearly they're not doing as well as they would like as mentioned in their recent financial <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a> from CEO Yves Guillemot: "We are clearly disappointed by our recent performance. We are facing contrasted market dynamics as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and everlasting live games, in the context of worsening economic conditions affecting consumer spending.".</p>

      <title>Rhythm adventure Hi-Fi RUSH from Tango Gameworks gets a surprise release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tango Gameworks, developer of The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, along with publisher Bethesda just stealth released their latest game called Hi-Fi RUSH.</p>
<p>It’s an awesome looking rhythm adventure with a bit of Jet Set Radio styling. You join with the protagonist Chai having a music player in their chest and a makeshift junk guitar you swing around at enemies with the music. Here you’re fighting against an evil tech megacorp and the characters, world and combat all flow along with the music and it has some great cartoony cutscenes too. It even sprinkles in plenty of comedy, and there’s been a good few laugh out loud moments from me.</p>
<p>At release it was rated as Steam Deck Playable by Valve. <em>Playable</em>, not Verified, due to it apparently having text that can at times be too small. It does otherwise work great out of the box though, clearly this had some testing before release by either Valve or the developer / publisher directly. Have a look in the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gsws9AueNLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b862524da37ad65f261b7d9bf627257e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gsws9AueNLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since this is a rhythm game, you do need to pay attention to the music. I’ll admit I actually find rhythm games genuinely difficult because I just don’t have any rhythm for it but it’s fun to try and the music fits it perfectly. Here though, they clearly thought of people like me too, as you can tap a button at any time to bring up a rhythm bar to help you time your attacks correctly.</p>
<p>As you go through the game collecting scrap, you eventually get to use it at your hideout with a new friend who helps you with upgrades to attacks to give you new combos, special attacks, items and permanent upgrades. So it only gets more epic as you go through.</p>
<p>While it has some fantastic music, something I of course appreciate is that it has a streamer mode, so for videos and livestreaming, it will replace some tunes from popular artists that would get you a copyright hit with original tunes made just for the game. It’s nice to see some developers care.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chai Versus the World - Labeled ‘defective’ after a shady corporate experiment mistakenly fuses a music player to his heart, Chai must now fight for his freedom in a slick animated world where everything – platforming puzzles, enemy attacks and even the colorful gags &amp; banter - are synced to the beat.</li>
<li>Open Up the Mosh Pit! - Take on armies of corporate drones (read: actual robots) in satisfying, rhythm-amplified combat. Time your moves to pull off flashy Beat Hits, hard-hitting special abilities and even combination attacks with your allies! Want to show off? Go further and tap into the beat to amp up your skills and earn those covetous S-rank scores.</li>
<li>Rowdy Rebels Vs. Badass Bosses - Lead a squad of colorful teammates and take the fight to the heart of an, er, heartless corporation. Square off with each department’s boss, from Production to Marketing to Finance, each more ready to protect the company’s bottom line than the last in over-the-top battle sequences accompanied by their own music tracks!</li>
<li>Grab Your Headphones - Tap your toes to a killer mixtape of original music, as well as songs by Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, The Joy Formidable and more! Want to show off your skills to a live streaming audience? Fret not: Hi-Fi RUSH includes a streamer-friendly alternate audio mode to keep you from broadcasting copyrighted music.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the box on Medium settings performance hasn’t been a problem at all on Steam Deck. Some momentarily blips here and there, but for the most part it’s been impressively smooth to the point that I haven’t felt like I needed to change any settings and that’s just fantastic. Exactly the kind of experience I want to see more of on the Steam Deck when it comes to performance.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush not only has a great artistic style to it but it makes interesting use of different perspectives too. It has a fully 3D environment you run through, but at times it will also pull the camera back to be side-on like a classic platform and some of the bigger battles give you a special area to run around with multiple stages to fight through. There’s a <em>lot</em> to enjoy about this one.</p>
<p>While this is only an early impression because it just came out of nowhere, I’m seriously impressed and enjoying the heck out of it. The only downside so far, is that it comes with Denuvo Anti-tamper.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>4A Games release a full Metro Exodus SDK for modders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>4A Games have done something quite awesome. They've <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/412020/view/5254045511872508445" target="_blank">released</a> a SDK for people to make full game modifications of Metro Exodus. </p>
<p>This isn't some basic level modding abilities either, they've gone the full mile and released their own editor that enables people to create fully standalone content too. It has integrated <a href="https://mod.io/" target="_blank">mod.io</a> support as well, so it's not tied to Steam. They said it includes "some tutorial levels and as an example of a fully featured, shipped level, we’ve included a full unpacked Metro Exodus sandbox level for you to tear apart using our tools".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11206653671674736853gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11206653671674736853gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One thing to be clear on though is that they're <em>not</em> entering the game engine licensing business. So, you cannot sell your works with it or put it behind any kind of paywall. This is just something they decided to do for their modding community. Pretty fun to see another game engine going a lot more open like this. Hopefully in future they'll perhaps open it up even more if this goes well.</p>
<p>The Exodus SDK only has a native build for Windows but we know their editor is clearly able to make Native Linux builds too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/metro-exodus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/412020/Metro_Exodus/" target="_blank">Steam</a> - both stores have it with 75% off right now too.</p>

      <title>Developer of point and click adventure Splittown looking at Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your adventure games? Here's one to keep an eye on. The developer of Splittown has mentioned they're looking into Native Linux support. They're making the game with Visionaire Studio, which has Linux support, so hopefully it won't be too much trouble if they decide to do it.</p>
<p>Writing on their Steam forum <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2117400/discussions/0/3321988498676426081/?tscn=1674387698#c3759977302535798342" target="_blank">they said</a> earlier this week "FYI I'm looking to make a Linux build hopefully over the weekend or next week the latest. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uLwUO14sW7Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43ca9c44ea11240fbf96faf7af9e7d4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uLwUO14sW7Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cold War has split the world in two, both figuratively and literally. The Great Divide spans across the globe with an impenetrable mess of concrete and barbed wire sandwiched between the two blocs. You are Leonard Nimby; stone-faced former top agent of IM5, hot on the trail of a shrink gun stolen from you by a villanous mayoral candidate on the eve of a fateful election.<br/>
<br/>
Splittown is a point-and-click adventure game inspired by 90s classics such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road. You'll crack confounding puzzles, stuff improbable amounts of items in your pockets, and engage in humorous dialogue with a colorful cast of characters on an adventure that will push your wits to the limit.</p>

      <title>Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8 get an open source reimplementation with OpenEnroth</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Want to play Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8 on modern systems with an updated game engine? Well, <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth" target="_blank">OpenEnroth</a> looks mighty promising.</p>
<p>It's nowhere near finished yet with only Might and Magic 7 playable but it's regularly seeing contributions to keep working away on it. Support for 6 &amp; 8 will be added in the future, obviously they need to start somewhere. The idea, like a lot of these open source projects including OpenMW for Morrowind or OpenRA for Red Alert (and others), is to build a platform to have it run on modern systems with enhancements while keeping the original game feel.</p>

      <title>Atari announce another 80s classic revival with Caverns of Mars: Recharged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another revamp of a classic is on the way with Atari once again teaming up with SneakyBox, as the 1981 title Caverns of Mars is releasing as Caverns of Mars: Recharged.</p>
<p>In Caverns of Mars: Recharged, players progress through 30 missions set within three primary "depths" of Mars, descending deeper and deeper into enemy territory. Blast through oncoming hostile fire, bull through debris and obstructions, and dodge other obstacles all while keeping a close eye on fuel and ammo reserves. Featuring a unique local co-op mode, players can team up with one partner assigned to navigation while the other player shoots the drone. From the trailer below, it looks pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d0zp4P9SHUo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7199a8697e0d5792868c66a2153a11e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d0zp4P9SHUo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Caverns of Mars is a great early example of a game designed for Atari’s 8-bit computers, which makes it a perfect addition to the Atari Recharged series,” said Atari CEO Wade Rosen. “It’s an intensely fun arcade-style experience in both single player and two-player co-op.”</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Destructible: </strong>The environments in <em>Caverns of Mars: Recharged </em>are fully destructible; don’t hesitate to blast through any obstruction in your way, but be wary of fuel reserves. Each shot depletes fuel, but speedy travel grants time bonuses! </li>
<li><strong>Arcade Mode:</strong> Traverse the depths of Mars in three stages, strategically choosing upgrades and power-ups that will make each run unique.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Mode: </strong>Progress through 30 bite-sized challenges across navigation, combat, and other exciting scenarios. </li>
<li><strong>Perky Power-Ups:</strong> Collect weapons that will change your strategy on the fly for tactical maneuvering. Carve a new path with a well-aimed railgun shot or let the spread of a shotgun blast do the talking for you! </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can wishlist / follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2213980/Caverns_of_Mars_Recharged/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's releasing in March and will have Native Linux support like previous titles developed by SneakyBox.</p>

      <title>Lots more EA games get a Steam Deck Playable rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has again continued to go through various EA games that were previously problematic on Steam Deck due to the new EA App, with lots of them now marked as Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>They only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ea-games-playable-on-steam-deck-sims-4-jedi-fallen-order/" target="_blank">just recently</a> tweaked a few others including Battlefield 1, Jedi Fallen Order, Sims 4 and Titanfall 2 and so they've continued on now. Nice to see Valve are acting on all their work going into <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> for improving Windows to Linux compatibility for games. <em>I'm surprised it took this long though.</em></p>
<p>Here's all the latest games I've found that have been bumped up to Playable with them now using Proton Experimental by default since that has all the EA App fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Way Out</li>
<li>Battlefield 4</li>
<li>Battlefield V</li>
<li>It Takes Two</li>
<li>Madden NFL 21</li>
<li>Madden NFL 22</li>
<li>Madden NFL 23</li>
<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</li>
<li>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</li>
<li>Need for Speed Heat</li>
<li>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</li>
<li>Need for Speed Most Wanted</li>
<li>Need for Speed Rivals</li>
<li>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2: Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>Unravel Two</li>
</ul>
<p>This long list only goes to show just how much of a ridiculous <em>nuisance</em> third-party launchers on Steam can be. There's often simply no need for them, other than extra advertising for big publishers. One day, I hope this repeating launcher problem gets solved for good, it's frustrating to have games work great and then suddenly one update later they're full of issues because of an extra launcher.</p>

      <title>ControllerTools plugin for Steam Deck now gives low battery notifications</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Steam Deck plugin for Decky Loader that I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/this-new-steam-deck-external-controller-plugin-is-quite-useful/" target="_blank">recently mentioned</a>, ControllerTools, has a fresh update out to make it more useful.</p>
<p>Since I last covered it, all of this has been added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New feature:</strong> Added low battery alerts. These can be toggled via a new UI setting.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when multiple controllers with the same product/vendor ID are plugged in.</li>
<li>Add a debug mode UI setting to enable verbose logging.</li>
<li>There isn't support yet for battery capacity for Xbox controllers connected over USB. Hide the percentage indicator for now.</li>
<li>Added hacky support for Xbox controllers battery capacity.</li>
<li>Add more generic support for controllers and icon for Stadia.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully though, at some point Valve will be able to hook up their own built-in features like this for third-party controllers but until then ControllerTools really does add some useful stuff.</p>
<p>You can find the plugin on <a href="https://github.com/alphamercury/ControllerTools" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Installing it with Decky Loader is easy, since it has a built-in plugin store to just download various plugins all directly inside Gaming Mode on Steam Deck. This update is currently <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-database/pull/205" target="_blank">pending</a> approval, so it should be live sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Factorio is about to increase in price so be quick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of the awesome Factorio have announced that the price is about to go up, so if you still haven't purchased it now is the time. Honestly this truly is one of the best indie games ever made, with full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck "Playable" too.</p>
<p>This is the third price rise in 7 years (at least going by GBP) and it's never been on sale either, so it's not like holding out for a big sale event on various stores is going to help.  The price will rise by $5 tomorrow (and likely the equivalent in your currency), January 26th, as announced by the official <a href="https://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good day Engineers,</p>
<p>Next week, on Thursday 26th January 2023,<br/>
We will increase the base price of Factorio from $30 to $35.</p>
<p>This is an adjustment to account for the level of inflation since the Steam release in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3647544351674645008gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3647544351674645008gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Why don't they ever put it on sale? It's a good question and their original <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=159626#p159626" target="_blank">answer</a> on this was about "respecting the players who have already purchased the game" and not to "reward the people who hold off on buying the game". It's a pretty fair point really and they've done well to sell so many copies without a sale with an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam and Steam Deck Beta add the ability to move the on-screen keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues to roll out new unstable releases of the Steam Client for Desktop and Steam Deck, with a new update giving the ability to move the on-screen keyboard. Looks like someone has been reading <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">my wishlist</a>.</p>
<p>In the Steam Deck <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3635002625404567687" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Added ability to move the standalone &amp; overlay keyboard. The keyboard will cycle through a set of positions.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed controller input in the windowed version of the controller configurator</li>
<li>Added mouse buttons to the events that will skip the start-up movie</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659772423356815885" target="_blank">Beta</a> included the above and additionally these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Added a notification when an Xbox controller is plugged in, but Windows settings prevent reading the Guide button (which prevents bringing up the Steam main menu and other functionality like chords).</p>
</li>
<li>Added a quick guided tour</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, the ability to move the on-screen keyboard is a bit hit and miss. Sometimes it works, sometimes it vanishes needing you to open it again and sometimes doing it will then seemingly break Steam Input where only the touch screen then works on Steam Deck. So they have a lot more work to do on that. That's what a Beta is for though of course, to test. It also only seems to work in Desktop Mode and the locations are limited to top and bottom.</p>
<p>New Big Picture Mode is also still terribly buggy and slow on NVIDIA when trying it on Desktop, pretty much unusable. Hopefully Valve or NVIDIA can solve that.</p>

      <title>Forspoken needs desktop Linux to spoof being a Steam Deck to work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 25/01/23</strong>: Valve are now <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=17495330" target="_blank">forcing</a> the spoofing of a Steam Deck server-side, so the workaround is no longer needed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In a case of what the heck? Square Enix and Luminous Productions just released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/" target="_blank">Forspoken</a>, which works on Steam Deck but it won't run on desktop Linux without spoofing it being a Steam Deck. One of those moments where I had to blink a good few times, wipe my glasses and let out a big sigh. </p>
<p>To run it on desktop Linux you can either load launch Steam directly with "-steamdeck" or by setting "SteamDeck=1 %command%" as a launch option for the game itself. No this isn't a joke. It's not entirely clear why but I'm not going to say the developer or publisher actively chose to block Linux desktop, it's more likely they just didn't think about what they were doing outside of letting it run on Steam Deck specifically (which runs SteamOS Linux).</p>
<p>Without that workaround, launching it on desktop Linux gives you this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19843946761674596859gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19843946761674596859gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>It "didn't be installed" on my <s>Windows</s> Linux.</em></p>
<p>But when launching with the workaround, well it's a different story. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13689737811674597651gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13689737811674597651gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Doesn't exactly seem very stable either, it would completely crash if I picked a different overall graphics preset. Some individual graphics settings made it completely crash too. I also couldn't get it to go above 30FPS, with Vsync off and a limit set to 120FPS it just wanted to stay at 30FPS (and plenty below that).</p>
<p>Looks like a rough launch with it being Mixed on Steam so far and plenty of critic reviews have not been particularly kind on it either. At £64.99 it just doesn't seem worth the price.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translator DXVK 2.1 adds HDR support, improves shader stutter issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK, one of the secret sauces included with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility layer, has a big new release out now. <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.1" target="_blank">DXVK 2.1</a> adds in some big new features like HDR!</p>
<p>Currently, this new HDR support is quite limited though. No major Linux desktop environment actually supports HDR yet, so you will have to use <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> specifically with it. When paired up with vkd3d-proton version 2.8 or newer, it "will allow D3D12 games to detect and use the HDR10 color space if they support it". It's also only supported on AMD GPUs, and even there it needs special Linux kernel patches.</p>
<p>One that perhaps is more exciting, because pretty much everyone will benefit, is even more improvements to shader compilation. From the release notes it states the use of "pipeline libraries was extended to pipelines with tessellation or geometry shaders in order to further reduce stutter". On top of that, if your GPU driver supports it, more features of the VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 extension are being used to reduce stutter when MSAA is on.</p>
<p>Another performance upgrade is that DXVK will use fewer threads for background optimization of graphics pipelines, which may make games smoother on some systems but it doesn't change the <em>initial</em> shader compiling.</p>
<p>Some other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new GLFW backend for Native Linux builds using DXVK.</li>
<li>More consistent D3D11 performance.</li>
<li>A workaround for the Uplay overlay getting stuck on.</li>
<li>Fixes for: Ashes of the Singularity, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Cardfight!! Vanguard, Gujian 3, Resident Evil 4 HD, Saints Row: The Third, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Sonic Frontiers and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I'm quite excited to see all the improvements. Hopefully it won't be too long before the Steam Deck and Proton together get upgraded to make use of it all.</p>

      <title>Wine 8.0 is out now with major compatibility improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 8.0 is out now, a big improvement over the last stable release with many upgrades for Windows to Linux compatibility across thousands of games and apps. This is part of what makes up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, the compatibility used on Steam Deck to run Windows games.</p>
<p>One of the major changes here is the conversion to the PE format for various modules. This format is used by Windows, and an important milestone for Wine to increase compatibility with copy protection, 32-bit applications on 64-bit hosts, Windows debuggers and more. Work is still to be done though to finish it properly, as some modules still need to be properly converted.</p>
<p>The Wine developers say they also implemented a "special syscall dispatcher", to avoid the overhead of a full NT system call to minimise the performance impact.</p>
<p>WoW64 was upgraded too, and once the final PE work is done, they say it will then be "fully possible" to run 32-bit Windows applications without needing 32-bit libraries. This is no doubt something many are looking forward to.</p>
<p>Lots of Media Foundation fixes and improvements too that should help audio and video issues across many apps and games, Direct2D upgrades, lots of optimizations for Direct3D and newly supported Direct3D 10 and 11 features are in, better steering wheel support, big improvements to controller hotplugging, better force feedback support, better support of DualShock and DualSense controllers, better support for CJK fonts and so on.</p>
<p>Absolutely lots more you can see in the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.0" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully later this year Proton will see a full upgrade to the latest Wine release, to give us even more improvements for gaming on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental and GE-Proton 7-47 updates available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve gave <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">Proton Experimental</a> a small update with two improvements, plus for users of <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> you may want to know about an important version bump there too for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gamers.</p>
<p>For <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> the latest update included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve multi-touch support.</li>
<li>Fix native scrollbar being always visible in Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proton Hotfix</strong> also seemed to get an update, although there's no notes anywhere I could see on what has actually changed there.</p>
<p>If you're confused on Proton and all the different versions, see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my original guide on Proton</a>. Proton Experimental gets automatically installed if Valve set it on a game, or you can just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it. Then in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu you can set it on individual games. I did a previous guide on swapping Proton versions below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f1GvONkE9S0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6bb07ac6333f611978e50464915ff76b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>GE-Proton 7-47</strong> also rolled out, as another quick update to the community-made build that included a rather urgent fix, as the release notes mentioned it has "been writing invalid state cache files that can lead to all sorts of trouble". So it seems like a pretty important one to upgrade to.</p>
<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: simply download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover in Desktop Mode (Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top and select to install GE-Proton.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: find the game in your library, go to the little COG on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select GE-Proton from the drop-down</li>
</ul>

      <title>Colony sim Stardeus adds in derelict ships, system scanning, new ship design system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/inspired-by-factorio-and-rimworld-space-colony-building-sim-stardeus-out-in-early-access/" target="_blank">Stardeus was one of the most promising</a> Early Access releases on 2022, giving you pretty much RimWorld in space and the first major update is out now. Clearly, the developer has been rather busy.</p>
<p>Taking on a ton of feedback from players, this update is largely focused on many systems that just make the whole game flow a bit better and some elements became far less tedious. </p>
<p>It now includes derelict ships as you adventure through the stars, letting you reel it in with a winch and attach it to your ship or scrap it for materials. There's also now precision thrusters to easily adjust your ship, big improvements to system scanning with a radar to let you find resources a bit easier and it even allows you to find derelict ships and planets with anomalies. An auto rebuild option will help when a big rock smashes into your ship, a ship design preview when starting a new game along with giving you a detailed ship plan to rebuild it the same, a whole bunch of new objects and the list goes on.</p>
<p>See the new overview from the developer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D8XbOko1RXo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eaf91ab161097fa45b5ec95fbb207bc8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D8XbOko1RXo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/stardeus?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX will be doing more colours for their Steam Deck backplate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Accessory brand <a href="https://jsaux.com/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> recently did a poll to see what colours people might like for a Steam Deck backplate and the winners are in.</p>
<p>Currently you can only order a clear backplate, well, they're <em>mostly</em> clear as it has a sort of frosted look to it which helps cover up the kind of small manufacturing issues you can see with some completely clear designs. People kept asking for colours though, and so JSAUX did a poll on Twitter with the result being Purple and Green as the winners and so they will be doing those sometime from April:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983199181674569069gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983199181674569069gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>I do wish Blue won though, I would have loved that but Purple looks pretty awesome I will admit.</em></p>
<p>JSAUX also recently (finally) released a <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1617458412136046592" target="_blank">statement</a> about their mishap on teaming up with a very dubious store after some pushing from me, and they're <a href="https://youtu.be/PI6GgNU1Z54" target="_blank">trying to do better</a> on a whole bunch of other points I raised with them too which is really good to see.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and Desktop Steam Beta improves Steam Input for Nintendo Controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Beta is out now for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3635001990334169993" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659771788285745556" target="_blank">Desktop Steam</a>, with a bigger focus on Steam Input improvements and some Big Picture Mode fixes too.</p>
<p>Once again, the changelog is the same across both since both clients now share nearly everything thanks to the desktop client now using the New Big Picture Mode. Given how Steam Input has to handle and support all sorts of controllers, it's no surprise at times some of them could do with improvements. This time around there's quite a few improvements for Nintendo Joycons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked the layout of the mode settings page to show more content</li>
<li>Added upper grips as an option for mode shifts.</li>
<li>Filtered Mode Shift button options to only show available buttons based on the controller type.</li>
<li>Fixed chord activator options for XBox and XBox Elite controller types.</li>
<li>Improved Layout Preview for Nintendo Switch Joycon Left/Right/Pair.</li>
<li>Fixed Capture button icon not being displayed for Joycon Pair.</li>
<li>Fixed the Switch Pro Layout Preview not showing the gyro.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch SL/SR buttons now show up as Bumpers for single Joycons or Grip buttons for a JoyCon Pair.</li>
<li>Joycon individual/pair Gyro now displays and functions properly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Big Picture Mode (on Desktop Mode in Steam Deck)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the cursor when in gamepad-navigation mode in Big Picture</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture Mode keyboard window not exiting when closed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with detecting game windows on Linux</li>
</ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to fix Ghost Recon Breakpoint on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play the new Steam release of Ghost Recon Breakpoint on Steam Deck? Or a Linux desktop? It doesn't run out of the box but here's how to fix it.</p>
<p>Breakpoint actually comes with both Vulkan and DirectX 11 that you can pick between when launching, although neither of the options currently work giving a DirectX error. Thankfully, you <em>can</em> work around it by changing one single file. A word of warning though: this game has Denuvo Anti-Tamper, and so swapping around Proton versions and going between PC and Steam Deck a lot will get you locked out (as it did for me). It also has the same issue as <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5511#issuecomment-1399504207" target="_blank">God of War</a> on Steam Deck, where it can hard-crash and reboot the Steam Deck — but just like God of War, not everyone has that problem.</p>
<p>Here's a video talking about it, plus the fix and the text guide is delow:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IBXkUwPuVU8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e70c6feba9f7984daa46105de0e81b98.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IBXkUwPuVU8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to fix it (be in Desktop Mode for Steam Deck):</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Properties of the game in Steam, go to Local Files and Browse.</li>
<li>Head into the BattlEye folder.</li>
<li>Edit the <code class="inline-code">BELauncher.ini</code> file in a text editor</li>
<li>On the line that says <code class="inline-code">64BitExe=GRB.exe</code> change it to <code class="inline-code">64BitExe=GRB_vulkan.exe</code></li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you select Vulkan when going to launch the game</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On desktop Linux though, there's another problem. It will keep forcing a small 720p window. The only workaround I've found for that, is to manually edit the settings file found somewhere like this:</p>
<p><code>/steamapps/compatdata/2231380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Ghost Recon Breakpoint/GRB.ini</code></p>
<p><em>The location above depends on where you have it installed.</em></p>
<p>Inside there, change "WindowMode" to 0. At least there you can maximise it. All other modes end up forcing 720p, which is even a bug on Windows in their Vulkan renderer with many posts on it. You can't set the resolution there, as the game overrides it but setting WindowMode to 0 lets you maximise, and the game sets the resolution to match the window.</p>
<p>As you can see from it on Fedora Linux working with the above:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14266701991674600115gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14266701991674600115gol1.jpg"/></a><em>KDE screenshots cause a huge FPS drop…</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>I do have a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6471" target="_blank">bug report</a> sent to Valve for Proton on this, and I've reached out to Ubisoft about it too. </p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 22: Happy Hacking</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-21-fluffy-bunnies/" target="_blank">Part 21: Fluffy Bunnies</a> </strong></p>
<p>As was true for many people at the time, some of my first real experiences of using Linux as a child came through the use of Knoppix, one of the first distributions to popularize the use of Live CDs. This allowed me to explore a wide swath of Linux applications while not disturbing the Windows environment I needed for school at the time. One of these was a role playing game which I recall I never got to work well, but lingered on in my imagination regardless.</p>
<p>As an adult I can recognize this as <em>Falcon's Eye</em>, a GUI for the venerable <em>NetHack</em> released by Jaakko Peltonen in 2001. The SourceForge page for the game is still online, but only has source code available for use on Linux machines, the building of which is a byzantine task given the variety of build modes. By trawling the Wayback Machine I was able to find links to RPM packages for the last stable 1.9.3 release already built for Red Hat Linux, making installation far simpler. </p>
<p>Even then setting up the game takes the form of modifying configuration files, either by editing jtp_options.txt located in the /usr/lib/games/nethackdir/config directory, which controls such things as graphic and sound modes, or by fiddling with the local ~/.nethackrc file for options specific to your personal user account. <em>Falcon's Eye</em> started in an oversized 1024x768 window on first launch, making consulting the jtp_options.txt file beforehand a good idea.</p>
<p>The default option of playing the MIDI soundtrack through timidity also caused <em>Falcon's Eye</em> to hang at times with a black screen. Changing to using the MIDI sequencer device of my sound card by using playmidi solved this issue and also gives the music a nice AdLib feel, but the cleanest rendition of the music is by use of the MP3 files through the mpg321 player, although doing so takes less advantage of my Sound Blaster 16 hardware.</p>
<p>As a <em>NetHack</em> novice the game comes with a steep learning curve, with the most important lessons for me being that you can move in diagonal rather than just cardinal directions, and that locked doors and chests can be kicked, rather than just picked or unlocked with keys. I also found myself hitting constant dead ends until I discovered that hidden passages and doorways could be revealed by pressing the "S" key. Learning how to fight at range is worthwhile as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11905077471673930890gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11905077471673930890gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1653888171673930774gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1653888171673930774gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>In terms of mechanics the most significant change <em>Falcon's Eye</em> makes to <em>NetHack</em> is having the game now be mouse driven, necessitating the addition of a sometimes overeager pathfinding system whenever I misclicked. Graphics are iconographic, being static replacements for the original ASCII characters, with no animation and often limited variation. At times I found myself being mauled by a jackal that I thought was just my tame little dog.</p>
<p>The quality of the artwork that is there can not be disputed however, being an appealing and consistent set that does do a lot to bring the Mazes of Menace to life. In tackling those mazes, I have found that playing as a Samurai works well for me, not that it stopped me from succumbing to many a painful death. My most successful run so far saw me be felled by a fire ant on dungeon level six, after it ignited my potions and left me to suffer a slow agonizing burn.</p>
<p>Roguelike concepts such as permadeath and procedural generation baffled me as a child, and even today leave me with a grudging acceptance that I am unlikely to ever beat the game. In fact, my first proper dive into the genre would not come until I played the far more accessible <em>Dungeons of Dredmor</em> about ten years later, itself being the brainchild of former Loki Software programmer Nicholas Vining. It may be heresy, but for me, being able to save made all the difference.</p>
<p>Since then I have at least gained experience in a number of contemporary <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> licensed games, giving me a better handle on some of the fantasy terminology and quirks used in <em>Falcon's Eye</em>, such as how lower armour class values are actually better than higher ones. <em>NetHack</em> is a hodgepodge of popular culture milieu, from discovering Hobbits running around searching for the One Ring, to including an entire Tourist role as some kind of elaborate joke.</p>
<p>Further work on <em>Falcon's Eye</em> stalled out by 2005, with later Linux Game Publishing alumnus Clive Crous forking the project into what would become <em>Vulture</em>, now purchasable on both itch.io and Steam, albeit with the source code still being freely available. No Arch Linux packages seem to exist, and the itch.io page only has Windows binaries available. I could compile <em>Vulture</em> from source, but if I am to go through all that trouble, I might as well build something fresh instead.</p>

      <title>dbrand bait Nintendo with their new SwitchDeck skin for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>dbrand have today revealed their latest way of poking fun at other companies, with their special edition <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/switchdeck?utm_source=GamingOnLinux&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=switchdeck" target="_blank">SwitchDeck</a> skin for the Steam Deck. This isn't the first time they've prodded the beast, like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/dbrand-issued-an-update-on-killswitch-replacements-dock-compatibility-and-more/" target="_blank">Killswitch</a> case for Steam Deck that they had to remake part of due to problems with magnets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years, countless blogs have clickbaited millions into believing that a "Switch Pro" was just around the corner. One Switch Lite and a Switch OLED later, we decided to tackle the problem ourselves. After stockpiling a considerable amount of ammunition, our lawyers quietly remarked how they would prefer if we abandoned the mercenary plot and instead went back to shameless plagiarism. Unfortunately for the blog writers, we know how to multitask.</p>
<cite>dbrand</cite></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7012682131674500220gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7012682131674500220gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>dbrand did tell me via email that they will be shipping the skin out to me, although they've not said when. So I might be able to take a look at the quality soon, maybe not. Based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aOqHNJBLDc" target="_blank">last skins I tried from dbrand</a> though, I would expect the SwitchDeck to be high quality.</p>
<p>As for why they did this, dbrand didn't note it but I spoke to the creator behind the Fan the Deck YouTube channel who said dbrand sponsored them on the idea for their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A09_2yy5f2o" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch emulation video</a> because only dbrand were crazy enough to sponsor such an idea. I doubt Nintendo will let that video stay up for too long…</p>
<p>You can buy the skin on <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/switchdeck?utm_source=GamingOnLinux&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=switchdeck" target="_blank">dbrand's website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck thoughts a year later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been <em>close</em> to a year since the Steam Deck launched, so here's where things currently stand and my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>I’ve had access multiple weeks before the official release, as I was one of the lucky people Valve sent a review unit to, so I’ve seen first-hand how many of the rough edges have been smoothed out over the last year and I have to say, I’ve only continued to be more and more impressed with how Valve has handled their latest hardware entry. Last year I even wrote about how I felt Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">hit a home run with the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to listen in, here's a little video I did to round-up some thoughts and give an overview that I put up on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube Channel</a> just recently:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I0L6NK-MfrU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fc65db1370902f3317b4ea8eef783ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I0L6NK-MfrU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Games in the video: Broforce, followed by Grim Dawn.</em></p>
<p>I've actually had <em>three</em> Steam Decks now. The first one being the original review unit I had to send back that had a dying fan, which I also accidentally snapped the SD Card inside when going to check, a reminder to always remove it if you're going to do some tinkering. Seriously, don't forget about it. If you're going to take the back off, remove the SD Card first. So there was the replacement for that, and then I purchased one personally when my time in the original reservation queue came up. Safe to say, I'm invested both personally and professionally. I play something on mine nearly every day, with a mixture of docked and handheld depending on how I'm feeling.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is by no means perfect, with many issues still remaining, but then that’s true of any hardware ever made by anyone. I could write a long list of problems I have with my iPhone, my Nintendo Switch and all the other devices I own. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, unless you're some kind of zealot, you will find problems in everything.</p>
<p>While it has issues, it remains my absolute <em>favourite</em> way to play games because of the convenience it provides to help unshackle me from my desk as well as the surprising power it has in what you can play on it.</p>
<p>Valve’s support of it has helped pull over many sceptics too. I remember reading The Verge and their headline was "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review" target="_blank">it's not ready</a>" and yet a year later, the same writer has now said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve" target="_blank">it's ready</a> and it's won them over to be their favourite gadget of 2022. That wouldn't have been possible without the constant upgrades from Valve, of which they’ve put out over 100 updates looking back at all the release notes. There's been some really big updates too like the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steamos-34-is-out-now-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4</a>. However, Valve has slowed down on stable Steam Deck updates, as they've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/we-may-get-a-steam-controller-2-plus-fun-updates-coming-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">moved over</a> to a monthly release schedule now for stable updates.</p>
<p>That's not even counting updates to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, their compatibility layer to run Windows games on Steam Deck that's used on Linux desktop too. Proton had tons of updates over the last year as well, as Valve keep chasing down issues in games and getting them fixed with various open source developers under contract to work on Proton, the graphics drivers and more. When you compare the compatibility on Steam Deck between now and when it launched, it's like a night and day difference, the improvements are simply astonishing. I'm sure desktop Linux gamers will understand this point too, the amount of games we have access to across the whole of Linux now is just awesome.</p>
<p>When it comes to Valve's updates it's not just the usual notes you might see from other hardware vendors, and their typical patch notes stating things like "improved stability". Valve always like to tell you exactly what they've done and they've repeatedly improved the interface on the Steam Deck too, like how they added proper multi-tasking and ensured recently switching between different apps and closing them all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhtK92WNJZs" target="_blank">worked nicely</a>.</p>
<p>With the Deck Verified system, Valve has seen plenty of things to be happy about there. Deck Verified is their official compatibility rating split between Verified, Playable for titles that have some issues and Unsupported with over 7,300 titles rated at least Playable (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-hits-over-7000-games-playable/" target="_blank">7,000 was hit towards the end of 2022</a>). You can continue to try and play anything of course, this is only what Valve has officially tested.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest and most played games around can be played on Steam Deck like: Elden Ring, Spider-Man Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, Warframe, No Man's Sky, Apex Legends, Valheim and the list just keeps going on.</p>
<p>Deck Verified is far from perfect though, you can’t really go anywhere without someone complaining about a rating on some game not being right. From Verified games that don’t actually work, to unsupported games that actually work perfectly. It’s an ongoing area of improvement that I hope the second year Valve really nails down, although the ratings are largely correct when you look at the bigger picture. It’s just a few random titles that slip through the net.</p>
<p>It can get quite annoying though, to have a Verified game that clearly shouldn't be Verified. A <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1617238571659972609" target="_blank">recent example</a> I can pull up is God of War, which has a confirmed issue and has been a problem for months, where the RAM use will shoot up to about 14.2GB and then the game will slow to zero FPS and eventually reboot the Steam Deck. While asking for perfection on any platform is ridiculous and impossible, it does show that Valve need to be a more reactive to change ratings, regardless of games being AAA or indie. It would also be nice for Valve to be more open on <em>how</em> they are reviewing titles to improve trust in it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has sat in the top 5 of the top sellers list (<a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) for something around 40 weeks, and the majority of that time has been at number 1 or number 2 when a few super hits came along to knock it down like Elden Ring or Modern Warfare 2 but it's quite rare to see it knocked down to the number 2 spot even a year later. The Steam Deck has some very clear staying power. It has only just launched in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-now-shipping-across-asia-plus-a-new-steam-deck-stable-client-update/" target="_blank">few select regions of Asia</a> too, so it should continue to sell quite well for some time.</p>
<p>So while the Steam Deck is going great, it still has some mountains to climb as well. A sore point continues to be anti-cheat, a constant problem with some of the biggest games not working like Destiny 2, PUBG, Dead by Daylight, Rust, Modern Warfare 2, Lost Ark, FIFA 23 and so on. There's not exactly a huge amount Valve can do about this though, as they worked with Epic Games on Easy Anti-Cheat support and the same for BattlEye, we just need more people using the Steam Deck for developers to care to make sure it's supported. That of course is an ongoing problem, but one that might eventually solve <em>itself</em> if the Steam Deck continues to be a success. Massive publishers will only chase the big monies. Then again, Ubisoft surprised us recently by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">fixing The Division 2</a>, which I am still surprised by.</p>
<p>It's repeatedly a marvel that you can play so many games on a portable like this, or hooked up to a TV or a monitor with either the official Valve dock or one of the great many USB-C docks available elsewhere. Previously PlayStation or Microsoft exclusive titles running on it is just amazing.</p>
<p>We've repeatedly seen publishers talk about their own excitement on it too, even Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/xbox-game-studios-talk-more-of-their-titles-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">repeatedly</a> made announcements to showcase their published games compatibility. Microsoft also even went as far as to create their own guide for Xbox Cloud Gaming on Steam Deck. See my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/microsoft-upgrades-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-linux-and-chromeos/" target="_blank">full guide on Xbox Cloud in this linked article</a>, you don't need Edge. The surprises through the last year just kept on coming.</p>
<p>The community around the Steam Deck building up has been fun to watch too. People learning how Linux works, because it's powered by SteamOS and not Windows. We've seen the Heroic Games Launcher and others repeatedly improve to help with getting other stores working on Steam Deck like GOG and Epic Games. Then there's the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/decky-loader-makes-steam-deck-plugins-even-easier-with-new-installer/" target="_blank">Decky Loader plugin system</a> I've covered a few times, that can really help add in some essential extras Valve has yet to add into the system or has no plans to add, the possibilities with the Steam Deck just feel endless because of Valve's support of it being such an open platform and I think this is what will keep it being so popular because so many people are really appreciating that there’s no walled garden locking you in.</p>
<p>It's not just the software community though, the hardware community is incredible too. So many people still coming up with new and clever ways to attach things to the Steam Deck, like my favourite being the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">Deckmate attachment system</a> that lets you slot anything onto the back of the Steam Deck. We’ve had a few gaffs like dbrand with their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/project-killswitch-sales-suspended-as-the-kickstand-messed-with-the-steam-deck-fan/" target="_blank">problematic magnets</a> (that some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/stop-mixing-magnets-with-the-steam-deck-or-face-fan-and-temperature-troubles/" target="_blank">haven't learned from</a>), but it’s all still fun to see companies try things for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9558120521674484630gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9558120521674484630gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: the Deckmate.</em></p>
<p>Plenty more companies have jumped in too like JSAUX with various docks like one with an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-jsaux-m2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-is-a-great-choice/" target="_blank">M.2 SSD slot</a>, there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler too</a> and the list of companies doing Steam Deck docks goes on and on. Many of them beating Valve to the punch on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">Official Docking Station</a>. JSAUX are even doing transparent Steam Deck backplates now too (and <a href="https://youtu.be/PI6GgNU1Z54" target="_blank">JSAUX are trying to improve</a>).</p>
<p>Faced with an increasing amount of competition now from GPD, AYANEO, OneXPlayer and more, who are putting out more and more devices with newer chips in them, but often much higher prices, it will be fun to see how it all continues to build up. Valve opened the flood gates (flood valve?!) for handheld PC gaming and we still haven’t even seen the public release of SteamOS 3 yet, for more vendors to use it and for potentially people to make their own steam machines with it.</p>
<p>Even with the competition noted above, Valve will still clearly come out on top. It's not enough to keep producing these new shiny handhelds with more powerful internals, if the price is a lot higher and with a lack of support as each company swiftly moves onto their next upgraded model. Something that I hope, perhaps, a SteamOS 3 launch might help with, because support could improve there across many devices over time.</p>
<p>We do know a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2</a> is at least planned too, so clearly this is not going to be a one time thing for Valve, something people were a bit worried about prior to release. Given the success, it would be weird if they didn't continue it.</p>
<p>My Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist</a> mostly still applies too, like the shader cache problem — when I went to load up God of War last night, it needed to deal with the shaders for a good 30 minutes before the game loaded.</p>
<p>That's pretty much the state of things Steam Deck as they are now nearly a year on. There's a lot to look forward to from games coming out to continued Steam Deck upgrades, I'll be here covering all of it.</p>

      <title>Valve marks some EA games Playable on Steam Deck again like Sims 4, Jedi: Fallen Order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA recently sent Origin to the graveyard and replaced it with the EA App, which caused numerous problems on Linux desktop and Steam Deck but it looks like the biggest problems are over on that.</p>
<p>The problem is that these extra external launchers can cause a number of issues for the Proton compatibility layer. This is because Valve (and their open source contractors who work on Proton) need time to catch-up on the compatibility side. The switchover <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/ea-begins-swapping-out-origin-for-ea-app-on-steam/" target="_blank">came with problems</a>, which Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/valve-fix-new-ea-app-in-proton-experimental-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">partially solved</a> a week later but it still had issues leading me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/how-to-fix-the-ea-app-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">to do a guide</a> on getting it working again. Another few weeks later, Valve put a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/proton-experimental-upgraded-to-fix-the-ea-app-failing-to-update-on-steam-deck-a-linux/" target="_blank">proper fix in</a> to stop the EA App failing to update.</p>
<p>With that all done and the dust settled, Valve has now gone back through multiple problematic EA published titles to re-review them for Steam Deck compatibility.</p>
<p>Titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 1.</li>
<li>Jedi Fallen Order.</li>
<li>Sims 4.</li>
<li>Titanfall 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>All officially noted to be playable again, with Valve setting them to use Proton Experimental by default.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see Valve do go back over certain titles to check them again, although they really need to do that for God of War that <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1617238571659972609" target="_blank">has a bug</a> that can reboot your Steam Deck.</em></p>

      <title>Rocket League is getting additional anti-cheat functionality</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a move that could cause issues for Linux desktop and Steam Deck gamers, Rocket League is going to introduce new anti-cheat measures. <em>Something people argued with me on Twitter some time ago that wouldn't happen — I was right again.</em></p>
<p>Rocket League originally had Native Linux support and the development studio Psyonix was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/05/psyonix-creator-of-rocket-league-is-joining-epic-games/" target="_blank">acquired by Epic Games</a> back in 2019. Then in early 2020 they ended support for Linux and macOS, and later that year it became an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC. Thanks to how far Wine and Proton have come though as Windows compatibility layers, it actually continued running nicely on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. That might change though.</p>
<p>The problem is that Rocket League has recently seen a surge of AI bots being put into online games, so that people can cheat. An issue highlighted by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cheaters-hacked-an-ai-bot-and-beat-the-rocket-league-elite/" target="_blank">Wired</a>, where high-level players were seeing odd behaviour with players that had seemingly "superhuman skill". It's a growing problem, that developer Psyonix is now addressing.</p>
<p>In a statement on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/10g5ods/update_on_bots_in_online_matches/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the last several weeks, the introduction of third-party bots to online matches – in Competitive Playlists, especially – has understandably been a very active topic among the Rocket League community.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we took action against a number of accounts running bots in Rocket League. This banwave should cover the vast majority of accounts that have used bots since they first appeared in online matches towards the end of 2022, and we will continue to monitor for bots and take appropriate action against any players/accounts using them. Furthermore, to help us address bots in future matches, we have added a “Cheating” report reason back into the game. You can find this in game on the report reason list in the Report/Block menu.</p>
<p>Finally, we are taking steps to introduce additional anti-cheat functionality into Rocket League. This is in progress with the engineering teams, and we’ll share more on this once we’re closer to implementation.</p>
<p>While we have been quiet on the subject during this time, we have been actively investigating these bots since they first appeared late last year. We strive to be active participants when it comes to community conversations about our game, but we are always going to be more deliberate on issues related to game security and competitive integrity, withholding comments until we are ready to take action.</p>
<p>There is a zero tolerance policy when it comes to using bots in online play. This is considered both cheating and matchmaking abuse, and it violates the Rocket League <u><strong>Terms of Use</strong></u> as well as the <u><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></u>. Also, if you are interested in working with Psyonix directly on anything bot-related, you can reach out to us here on Reddit, on Discord, or Twitter. Thanks, everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anti-cheat is a repeating problem for Linux desktop and Steam Deck gamers, often blocking out games entirely from working. Hopefully this won't be a repeat of previous issues but it's worth highlighting for any readers who enjoy playing Rocket League.</p>

      <title>Turn-based city-builder set on Mars, Farlanders has launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farlanders is a turn-based city-builder from Andriy Bychkovskyi and publisher Crytivo that has you colonize and attempt to terraform the red planet. It's available now with Native Linux support, but no Steam Deck rating as of yet.</p>
<p>"Lead the charge in establishing a colony on Mars in this turn-based strategy game with a nostalgic look but fresh gameplay. Use specialized tools to terraform the planet, build residential areas for your colonizers, and construct resource-producing factories in an effort to become a self-sustaining society."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="omF4BR5AWe8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d485f48ef9e901b82b6790254a110fd7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/omF4BR5AWe8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7 campaign missions with narrative tied to the Farlanders: Prologue.</li>
<li>Competitive freeplay game mode with 3 scenarios.</li>
<li>Build your own colony on (and below) the Martian surface using more than 50 different structures.</li>
<li>Terraform the planet using a variety of tools.</li>
<li>No 2 maps are ever the same with procedural map generation.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather changes and anomalies.</li>
<li>Research tree with 19 technologies.</li>
<li>Trade with other colonies that will reflect fluctuating market prices and demands.</li>
<li>Uncover alien artifacts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I sadly simply haven't had time to personally play through this one, however I did enjoy the demo and the Prologue as it has some interesting mechanics. The Prologue had a good user review score too, as does the full game with them both being "Very Positive" on Steam. Nice to see more developers continue Native Linux support, and provide a free Prologue for people to actually see if they like it first, I do miss the days of easy to find demos but glad to see them come back in a new form.</p>
<p>You can buy it now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318740/Farlanders/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/farlanders" target="_blank">GOG</a> but not clear when.</p>
<p>On top of that you can try the free Prologue on <a href="https://andriy-bychkovskyi.itch.io/farlanders-prologue" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/farlanders_prologue" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1460540/Farlanders_Prologue/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to see if it's something you might like.</p>

      <title>Free open source RPG &#39;FreedroidRPG&#39; arrives on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not going to win any awards on style but some of you may want to know that the classic free and open source RPG FreedroidRPG is now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1979930/FreedroidRPG/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <em>A name some older readers might not have seen for a while…</em></p>
<p>This is a game I remember reading about and following along back in the early days, way before Steam came to Linux and when Wine couldn't exactly run a whole lot. It might not be up to modern standards in many ways but fun to see it continue on. Linux has obviously come a very long way as a gaming platform with so many games available to play either Native or through Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-bUiKnrkKDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89016736834752ca9e56b4e25d2f21c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-bUiKnrkKDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I have to admit a penguin slapping robots is quite amusing.</em></p>
<p>More about it from the developers: "Freedroid aims to provide a popular reference game in the open-source world. Our goal is to do so through the implementation of an immersive world with distinctive dialog and graphical styles in a format that is friendly to all ages while providing a fair amount of choice to the player. In view of this, we rely on high quality literary content to provide entertainment and emotional investment as well as educational benefits."</p>
