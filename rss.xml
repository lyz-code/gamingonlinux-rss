      <title>Paradox and C Prompt team up for Millennia and it looks very Civilization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Civilization is that you? No wait it's Millennia, a new 4x strategy game announced today by Paradox Interactive who have teamed up with C Prompt Games and it does look quite interesting but it's going to get heavy Civ comparisons.</p>
<p>C Prompt Games includes people who have worked on games like Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology and Starcraft II, as well as Orcs Must Die helmed by veteran strategy game developers Rob Fermier, Ian Fischer and Brian Sousa. The first announcement teaser is below but it doesn't really give you much:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vx0NBKcVlH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a02cc8d761cdffe148b62c8988b9fbc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vx0NBKcVlH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features of Millennia include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>History and Alternate History: Lead your people through ten historical ages, steer your timeline into the uncharted alternate history of a Variant Age or the danger and opportunity of a Crisis Age. Each Age involves unique rules, units, buildings, goods, and challenges, which can alter the path of history.</li>
<li>National Spirits: Decide what your Nation is famous for by selecting National Spirits and using the bonuses they provide to achieve your goals.  Combine multiple National Spirits as you progress through history to craft a unique civilization in every game.</li>
<li>Domains: Invest in six different Domains that influence the focus of your Nation – Exploration, Government, Warfare, Diplomacy, Engineering, and Arts.  The better you provide for each, the more your Nation can make use of unique Domain Powers.  Everything from claiming territory, to adopting new governments, to spreading religion, to reinforcing Armies flows from mastery of the Domains.</li>
<li>Deep Economy: Design your economy to support your strategy.  Gather raw materials, then build Improvements to refine basic Goods like logs or iron into lumber, paper, books, ingots, tools, or weapons – specialized products that allow you to improve and adjust your economic engine to suit whatever history sends your way.</li>
<li>Army Based Combat: Customize your approach to war by combining individual Units into powerful Armies.  Each Unit influences the capabilities of its Army, allowing you to employ a vast number of varied strategies.  Once in conflict, watch the action unfold through the Combat Viewer, where battles play out and provide details on how different Armies perform.</li>
<li>And more: discover natural landmarks, build the Pyramids, compete in the space race, finance expeditions, survive plagues, use diplomacy to your advantage, defeat barbarians, unleash innovations, deal with alien visitors, govern underwater cities, manage air combat, and master a host of other historical-themed content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The screenshots on Steam give a better look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15871724921695325820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15871724921695325820gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20649867231695325822gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20649867231695325822gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No word on system support yet other than "PC". Generally games outside of Paradox Development Studios directly don't do Native Linux support, so it's likely one to run with Proton.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper gets a mod SDK and mod.io support + Shimmering Frontier update due October 4th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The wonderful mining, exploration and crafting game Core Keeper just got a big upgrade adding in modding support via mod.io, there's a new modding SDK and next month a new free expansion launches.</p>
<p>For the modding support that's out now they went with <a href="https://mod.io/g/corekeeper" target="_blank">mod.io</a>, a cross-platform solution for modding from the Mod DB crew and it's integrated into the game directly, so you can browse and install mods directly (on top of viewing via the website). As for the SDK, it's built on Unity.</p>
<p>As for the upcoming free expansion it was previously known as the Crystal Biome, but the new name is Shimmering Frontier that will arrive on October 4th. It looks like a rather blue and shiny area that will come with the new Solarite Ore to let you craft new armour, tools and equipment to expand your adventuring. There's also going to be new enemies and a whole bunch of content sprinkled throughout the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9JUQYpWrbDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e27e251dab80d8971f671c4b71437f91.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9JUQYpWrbDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Developing the Shimmering Frontier has been an amazing journey for us at Pugstorm. You might remember this one as the ‘Crystal Update’ that we announced all the way back in our first Early Access roadmap, and we know that this is the one you’ve all been waiting for. This update went through plenty of designs and iterations, carefully balancing community-requested features, heaps of new content, and references to the game’s lore until we felt like it was just right!<br/>
” - Sven Thole, Pugstorm COO.</p>
<p>Core Keeper is available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Squad-tactics heist RPG &#39;Cyber Knights: Flashpoint&#39; launches October 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trese Brothers have now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TreseBrothers/111103591020803596" target="_blank">announced</a> that their cyberpunk Squad-tactics heist RPG Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is going to launch on October 17th. This follows multiple impressive demos shown off during recent Steam festivals, where they were repeatedly improving it based on feedback so hopefully the full release is looking good.</p>
<p>Most recent trailer (few months old, but gives a good enough look at it) is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Zhuy_W3cAmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fff425f315fc1414a5fe08987225a7d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Zhuy_W3cAmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd Person Turn-based Squad Tactics</strong>: The best of modern tactical RPGs—gridless movement, cover &amp; overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Outsmart enemy security with creative stealth &amp; hacking or go loud with powerful weapons &amp; abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Cyberpunk Stories</strong>: Contacts, squad members, and world events will weave together in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1021210/announcements/detail/1701735458164171772" target="_blank">stories reminiscent of the pen and paper cyberpunk RPGs</a> we played for years while building the lore of this world.</li>
<li><strong>Thrill of the Heist</strong>: Choose your jobs &amp; work your network for advantages to pull this off. Get the crew you’ll need &amp; gear them up. Finally, look for ways to score a little more—what’s the worst that could happen?</li>
<li><strong>Power-Player Strategy</strong>: Balance factions, favors, reputation and more. Rivals, fixers, arms dealers and corporate big shots... who you work for, who you fail or betray, all of it can open and close opportunities for you. Watch your heat, and try to make sure more people owe you than the other way around.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Builds</strong>: Experiment with endless combinations of talents, multi-classing, cyberware, weapons and gear to build the perfect team.</li>
<li><strong>Safehouse Base Building</strong>: Build out your safehouse and upgrade rooms such as weapon shop, hund kennel and medical bay.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Characters</strong>: The jobs you take have consequences for both your crew and connections. Loyalty, traits, cybernetics and escapes—you might get offworld in the end, but will any of you be the same?</li>
</ul>

      <title>MonoGame plan to create a non-profit foundation to support development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The fallout from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">big Unity mess</a> continues, with the <a href="https://www.monogame.net/" target="_blank">MonoGame</a> team jumping in to present a new plan for the future of this open-source and cross-platform framework for game developers.</p>
<p>If you've not actually heard of MonoGame you've likely still played something originally created with it including the likes of Bastion, Streets of Rage 4, Chasm, FEZ, Axiom Verge, Stardew Valley, Tooth and Tail and a great many more (although some moved to <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>). That's just a few taking from their limited <a href="https://www.monogame.net/showcase/" target="_blank">showcase</a> page.</p>
<p>As for what they're planning: a lot! They're going to create a non-profit foundation, to ensure it remains open-source and free for all users. Their <a href="https://community.monogame.net/t/update-on-monogames-status/19457" target="_blank">statement</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the light of the recent news in the game industry and to reassure the community about our commitment, the MonoGame Team would like to share its future plans. The team wishes the MonoGame Framework to become future-proof, both from a technical and governance perspective.</p>
<p>This new era of the open-source project will see the creation of a non-profit foundation to which all rights and properties will be transferred to, with the aim of ensuring MonoGame remains open-source, and free for all and any scenario, including on consoles.</p>
<p>This foundation will allow the adoption of a more sustainable model and will open MonoGame to be supported by more patrons. A new board will be created within this organization with the task to define which projects to undertake, and how they may be funded, transparently.</p>
<p>We will discuss the roadmap at a later time, but we can already state that MonoGame’s goals will be set with regard to the quality of developer onboarding for the framework, its stability and console support of the current version, and the start of a new iteration to further expand MonoGame’s reach and capabilities.</p>
<p>We will communicate the progress of this transition based on developments in future announcements.</p>
<p>We look forward to everyone joining us on this new and exciting chapter.</p>
<p>The MonoGame Team.</p>

      <title>We may see Counter-Strike 2 release next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you ready for the next generation competitive FPS from Valve? Well, next week you might be able to jump into Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>On X (Twitter), the official Counter-Strike account <a href="https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1704541038633959492" target="_blank">posted</a> "What are you doing next Wednesday?" (September 27th), teasing that something is coming and it's not really hard to guess what that will be.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9850484111695311434gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Likely either an open Beta of Counter-Strike 2 for anyone to jump in, or a proper release if they think it's ready enough. <em>Hopefully Valve will also properly put up the Linux version too!</em></p>
<p>Valve said originally that CS2 would release in the Summer, but they've only done a Limited Test gradually inviting more players in so far. At release CS2 will be a free upgrade and replacement for Global Offensive, which is over 10 years old at this point so no doubt many are keen to see all the improvements.</p>
<p>Recently Valve also announced CS Rating — a precise display of your skill in Counter-Strike 2:</p>

      <title>GNOME 45 released with dynamic workspace indicator, camera indicator and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 45 has just been released and overall it looks like a rather nice release for this desktop environment, so here's a short run over what's new.</p>
<p>One of the major changes is the replacement of the Activities corner button on the top bar with a dynamic workspace indicator. It's a small change but looks pretty sleek to give you an idea of where you are at a glance in your workspaces. They also improved search performance across a range of apps like Software, Characters, Clocks, Files, and Calculator. Another great addition is an indicator for when a camera is in use, so no more sneaky camera activations as it should be clearer when one is being used but it's only available for apps using the latest camera tech like <a href="https://pipewire.org/" target="_blank">Pipewire</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="47aZgF6xmS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19415940e9ebc6b86f48993a8256fb73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/47aZgF6xmS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other enhancements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyboard backlight quick setting</strong>: the quick settings menu now includes a button for controlling keyboard backlights.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient video playback and recording</strong>: when possible, GNOME will now use hardware resources when playing videos and creating screen recordings. This is faster and uses less power.</li>
<li><strong>New quick settings keyboard shortcut</strong>: you can now use the new <em>Super+S</em> key combination to open and close the quick settings menu.</li>
<li><strong>Updated pointer visuals</strong>: GNOME’s pointers (also known as cursors) have a great new look for GNOME 45.</li>
<li><strong>Light system style</strong>: GNOME has a new option to give the system a light interface style, as opposed to the default dark look. This can be enabled using <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6198/light-style/" target="_blank">an extension</a> or from the command line with:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme prefer-light</code><br/>
Further integration is being investigated for future releases.</li>
<li><strong>New wallpapers</strong>: two beautiful new images were added to GNOME’s collection of backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Wayland support for <a href="https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap" target="_blank">Input Leap</a></strong>: this provides a software implementation of KVM-switch like functionality, allowing multiple computers to be controlled from a single keyboard and mouse. GNOME 45 allows this software to be used with modern Wayland sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Smoother pointer movement</strong>: performance improvements mean that the pointer will move smoothly even when the computer is busy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That last one above may sound familiar, as it's something the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/plasma-6-optimized-for-wayland-gaming-plus-compositor-crash-recovery/" target="_blank">KDE team also focused on recently</a>. Having a smooth desktop under load is quite essential!</p>
<p>Of course there's plenty more — check it out on their <a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>When you get it all depends on what distribution you're on, as they all have different release schedules.</p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection multiplayer seems broken on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1704979565318418783" target="_blank">X</a>, the Halo Support account mentioned they're looking into it - "The #HaloMCC team is investigating reports that players on Steam Deck are experiencing Easy Anti-Cheat error messages after Tuesday's update. Stay tuned for updates on this bug investigation."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12843613521695335386gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12843613521695335386gol1.png"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>After a recent update Halo: The Master Chief Collection seems to have broken online play support for Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>If you remember, back in April they did <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1643688636091863040" target="_blank">announce</a> Steam Deck support for online play and put up a <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14589112499348" target="_blank">support article</a> for it. This came with a few minor issues, like needing to pick the Steam launch option that actually says it's <em>off</em> (the options were backwards). Since the update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/976730/view/6739129688073805114" target="_blank">September 19th</a>, it just doesn't work with Easy Anti-Cheat errors.</p>
<p>When you go to launch multiplayer from the main menu with the option that has anti-cheat turned on you'll see an error like this when you try to go into multiplayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11659869531695236516gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11659869531695236516gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And when picking the Steam launch option with anti-cheat off, which going by their support article is still the option to actually use to have it enabled as it's backwards, you're met with this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11933832251695236516gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11933832251695236516gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by the error messages, it seems like they may have put the Steam options actually the right way around now but broke it in the process. I've tested this myself across both Proton 8 and Proton Experimental and neither works. Restarting it doesn't change anything, rebooting the Steam Deck doesn't help either.</p>
<p>Lots of people on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/16nh6ai/why_did_mcc_suddenly_break/?sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have noticed it and report the same issue (but a few note oddly it still works for them?), so hopefully Microsoft / 343 will fix whatever they did soon. I've reached out to their teams to see what's going on - will update if I get any reply.</p>

      <title>Robot Gentleman dev of 60 Seconds! blasts Unity, switches to Godot and increases funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The fallout from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">Unity's recent ridiculous pricing changes</a> and terrible communication continues, with developer Robot Gentleman now waving goodbye to Unity and joining up with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Robot Gentleman created the popular 60! series like 60 Seconds!, 60 Parsecs! and 60 Seconds! Reatomized.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/robotgentleman/status/1704495631010816030" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on X (Twitter) they said (copied into text, as it's an image):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent Unity runtime fee license change and the way it was introduced has been a shocking development for all of us at Robot Gentleman. The predatory nature of this misguided decision poses a significant threat to the work and independence of many game developers, including ourselves. We do not accept this, and we cannot simply stand by, watching this outrageous violation of trust.</p>
<p>We are bidding adieu to Unity. For good.</p>
<p>Our next project, which has been in development for 4 years, will be migrated to the Godot Game Engine. Furthermore, all our released games from the 60! series will be ported away from Unity as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But there is more. We have been supporting Godot financially since July 2022. We have now decided to increase our support to 1500$/month, effectively redirecting the value of our Unity licenses to Godot. Our engineers will also contribute to the development of the engine, as we pursue our next and future projects in Godot.</p>
<p>The chosen direction is challenging, but in the face of Unity's conduct this was the only decision to be made. This change is likely to introduce a few twists and turns and cause delays in our ongoing projects. However, once we navigate this transition, we believe we will find ourselves in a much better space to continue our independent journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of developers looking at alternative game engines and tech now to move away from Unity. This seems to have been a wake-up call for many on how the rug can be pulled from them when relying on proprietary software. Like how Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic just donated $100K to Godot + FNA</a> and will continue funding monthly.</p>
<p>Expect more of this to come. Even if Unity change their tune — the damage is done.</p>

      <title>Story focused point-and-click horror adventure Somnipathy is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battle against Sleep Paralysis, Restless Leg Syndrome and Night Terrors in the story focused point-and-click horror adventure Somnipathy. Certainly sounds like a rather unusual setting, although that makes it all the more intriguing. </p>
<p>"Each night point-and-click Aggy through Somnipathy - a creepy and surreal dungeon crawling thriller -while utilizing each day to prepare. If you fail, there’s always tomorrow… right?"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2069260/Somnipathy/" target="_blank">pick it up on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and there's also a demo available, with the developer explaining they expect a full first run to take between 10-15 hours.</p>
<p><em>It was also made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> so good to see more games release with it!</em></p>

      <title>Mortal Kombat 1 released and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mortal Kombat 1 from NetherRealm Studios, QLOC and Warner Bros. Games has now released and it has been rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve being able to do some early verification for another big game release. Interestingly, 6 days ago it was only rated as Playable. However Valve re-tested it yesterday and decided to bump it up to Verified with the currently unreleased <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/proton-80-4-is-now-in-testing-with-a-release-candidate/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-4 that's now in testing</a>. Reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1971870?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for desktop Linux are also quite favourable on it! So it's nice to see another release doing well for all types of Linux gamers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MYa7L4jp11E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/725a778ea6c3364799cc9a59533da7f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MYa7L4jp11E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you've picked it up for desktop or Steam Deck, feel free to comment your experiences with it. Not one I'm personally interested in, fighting games like this just aren't my cuppa. Amplified by the ridiculous pricing. It's £59.99 at a minimum and that doesn't even include all the characters, it's actually £84.99 for the Premium Edition if you want more, or there's various DLC (included in Premium) adding up to £67.95 to buy separately. Two of the DLC are just single characters, each at £6.49 — it feels overly greedy.</p>
<p>So far it has gained a <em>Mostly Positive</em> rating from over two thousand user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/mortal-kombat-1?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/mortal-kombat-1?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton 8.0-4 is now in testing with a Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve snuck out a Release Candidate build for Proton 8.0-4 last week, which brings with it many improvements to the main stable version of the Windows compatibility layer for Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>It's in the RC stage, as Valve are looking for feedback on any issues that weren't present in 8.0-3. Currently there's not many comments, so perhaps it needs a few more eyes to test your favourite games and report back any new problems. To access it select Proton 8 in your Steam Library, go into Properties -&gt; Betas and select the "release-candidate" option.</p>
<p>Here's everything changed in it (which may be different when fully released):</p>

<li>Added support for Steamworks SDK 1.58.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7095" target="_blank">RC on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There's no set date for Proton 8.0-4 to release for everyone. When Valve did the RC for Proton 8.0-3, it took over a month to release in full. And looking back, some previous RCs took even longer <em>but</em> then there's been other times where it was only a week. So basically "when it's ready".</p>

      <title>Terraria dev Re-Logic donates $100K to Godot Engine and FNA, plus ongoing funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a firm stand against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">what Unity have been doing</a>, Terraria developer Re-Logic announced today they've begun funding <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> with a big donation to each <em>and</em> ongoing funding.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1704227519027651016" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (Twitter), it reads as follows (copied into text, as it was an image statement):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The team at Re-Logic has been watching the recent events surrounding Unity with both interest and sadness. The loss of a formerly-leading and user-friendly game engine to the darker forces that negatively impact so much of the gaming industry has left us dismayed to put it mildly. While we do not personally use Unity (outside of a few elements on our console/mobile platforms), we feel like we cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget.</p>
<p>We do not feel that a simple public statement is sufficient. Even if Unity were to recant their policies and statements, the destruction of trust is not so easily repaired. We strongly feel that it is now equally important to get behind some of the other up and-coming open source game engines. Lighting some candles in an otherwise dark moment.</p>
<p>To that end, we are donating $100,000 to each of the open source engines listed below. Additionally, we are sponsoring each of these projects with $1,000/month each moving forward. All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17879634681695157671gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Re-Logic has always been supportive of game developers and indie studios that do things the right way. We feel that our actions in this moment are the best way to carry that mission forward - by accelerating and strengthening competing open source game engines, we hope to empower and assist studios that are struggling with how best to proceed given these recent events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's amazing to see so many people in the industry come together like this. Looking across X (Twitter), there's been a big wave of developers trying out and attempting ports to game engines like Godot so even more backing for it and other open source projects is fantastic. Hopefully this continues to be a wake up call for the industry to rely a little less on proprietary software.</p>
<p>Since the initial uproar over Unity, we've seen the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine funding</a> go from around €25K per month to €44K, which is a change from around 438 members to 1,119 members.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Beacon Patrol based on the popular board game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a planned full release in 2024, developers BrutalHack and Shapes and Dreams have put up a demo for Beacon Patrol - a relaxing game all about exploring the ocean. It's actually a digital adaption of the board game of the same name, one that's quite highly rated too.</p>
<p>You play as the captain of the Coast Guard, as you navigate the North Sea to secure its beacon buoys, lighthouses and waterways. You do so by placing down tiles to gradually expand the map to explore. Each turn you place up to three tiles, connecting to the tile your ship is currently on and then move across, with the game ending once all tiles have been played and you score points for each tile that is connected to other tiles on all four sides.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fdgT5c7BCuI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f767adcdd0ac6c285ee8ee47be8f7f9f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fdgT5c7BCuI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Beacon Patrol Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the North Sea, one tile at a time.</li>
<li>Experience the digital adaptation of the Beacon Patrol board game.</li>
<li>Team up with friends for a cooperative adventure at sea (Steam Remote Play Together supported).</li>
<li>Relaxing turn-based strategy meets calm maritime ambiance.</li>
</ul>
<p>I gave the demo a test today on my desktop and it worked great, seems like a lovely game overall to spend a little time with so be sure to give it a go.</p>
<p>At release it will have full Native Linux support and a demo is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273850/Beacon_Patrol/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>. The developer mentioned it's planned to be priced at $11.99.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group continues cuts with Beamdog shedding 26 people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is no studio safe from cuts? Embracer Group continues trying to reduce costs and now the latest we've seen has affected Beamdog. This news was confirmed via LinkedIn with multiple staffers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109542735073738754/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109561841374175232/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109588123667369984/" target="_blank">#3</a>) noting they had been laid off and multiple sources noting that a total of 26 people were given the boot.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Beamdog they worked on the likes of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition, Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition, Axis &amp; Allies 1942 Online and they just recently released MythForce.</p>
<p>This is all part of the immense cost-cutting that Embracer Group are doing after swallowing up absolutely loads of publishers and developers and then having a big funding deal <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">fail to go through</a>. Recent other reports include a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/embracers-troubles-continue-as-they-may-sell-off-borderlands-dev-gearbox/" target="_blank">possible sell-off of Gearbox</a> and they also completely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/embracer-closes-volition-developer-of-freespace-red-faction-saints-row/" target="_blank">shut down Volition</a>.</p>
<p>What studio will be in the firing line next?</p>
<p>Once again, this massive consolidation in the gaming industry causing problems. Bigger companies keep acquiring, and then eventually getting rid of them when they're not hitting some ridiculous goals. Hopefully all of this will cause more companies to think "do we really want to do this?".</p>

      <title>Comedy point and click The Will of Arthur Flabbington releases November 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Will of Arthur Flabbington is an upcoming comedy retro-styled point and click adventure, and now it has a confirmed release date for November 10th. Looks like it could be a good one for you gamers that appreciate the classic games.</p>
<p>In this game you're desperately trying to find your uncle's lost treasure with the help of a reluctant sidekick. Will you be able to set aside your differences and collaborate towards your common goal? The most recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wt9quYrNVbk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fd4afab621ae9af7101e8a3b6d1d3170.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wt9quYrNVbk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Bad news: your uncle died, and left you nothing in his will.<br/>
Good news: the will mentions a mysterious treasure.<br/>
Bad news: only two people can recover the treasure, and you're not one of them.<br/>
Good news: these two people don't want to recover it.<br/>
Bad news: they hate each other and won't collaborate.<br/>
It seems like you have to move on and forget about the inheritance. Unless you're Jack Flabbington, and resort to a psychic to contact your uncle's spirit. It will be easy, right? It's not like you'll end up bound to a random ghost until you find the treasure yourself, right?"</p>
<p>Features:</p>

<li>Puzzles!</li>
<li>A modern look-first-then-interact interface so you won't miss any juicy hints!</li>

      <title>Microsoft leak shows Fallout 3 and Oblivion Remasters, DOOM Year Zero and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems a whole bunch of gamers may be quite happy over the next few years, with a fresh leak from the ongoing saga of FTC v. Microsoft showing off a bunch of games coming. Spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, the list is actually from 2020 so it is a bit outdated and no doubt the plans have changed since ZeniMax Media was acquired by Microsoft in 2021.</p>
<p>Named Titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallout 3 Remaster</li>
<li>Oblivion Remaster</li>
<li>DOOM Year Zero</li>
<li>Ghostwire Tokyo Sequel</li>
<li>Dishonored 3</li>
<li>Indiana Jones</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's a few unnamed secret titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Hibiki</li>
<li>Project Kestrel</li>
<li>Project Platinum</li>
<li>Licensed IP Game</li>
</ul>
<p>Have to admit, the idea of a Fallout 3 Remaster has me quite excited, as possibly my favourite entry in the series. Hopefully at least some of this is still planned!</p>

      <title>Portal 2 VR mod gets an early release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still one of the best puzzle games ever made, Valve's Portal 2 now has a community-made VR mod available in the early stages that's already quite impressive. The mod works, although it's certainly a little rough around the edges with various bits not quite hooked up yet. Even so, it's impressive what modders are able to do with bringing games into the VR space.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr" target="_blank">mod GitHub</a> it notes that single-player, 6DoF VR view, motion controls for the portal gun, grabbing objects and Workshop content work. And since the most recent update, the in-game menu now works too. They haven't hooked up the full UI yet though but it's playable enough to have a bit of fun with.</p>
<p>I decided to check it out and captured some footage of me fooling around in it. Using Proton, since I couldn't get it to work with Valve's original Native Linux build, along with my Valve Index headset:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iM-ooCtjbl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0209d525e537eec037a7048e8fbc6ca5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iM-ooCtjbl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really impressive and they're working on it regularly, so it should just keep getting better.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank">Portal 2 on Steam</a> and see the <a href="https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr" target="_blank">VR Mod on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Unity Considers Tentative Changes To Controversial Policies</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you'll recall from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">previous coverage</a>, Unity Software last week came out with a plan to change runtime policies into what could be mistaken for a suicide note. That plan involved game developers paying a fee of up to $0.20 for every game install after the 200,000 lifetime mark and $200,000 a year in revenue. This change would be retroactive as well, for games already released. It was a plan that left devs both asking questions as to the feasibility of tracking every install and being enraged at what would be a death blow to their operations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">backlash</a> to this scheme was immediate and painful. Indie devs announced they would either be <a href="https://twitter.com/cultofthelamb/status/1701715971663425897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1701715971663425897%7Ctwgr%5E9a847cfa91ed7cc9692f1da1b25e7dc9cb0c1038%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fcult-of-the-lamb-developer-threatens-to-delete-game-on-jan-1-amid-unity-backlash" target="_blank">pulling their games</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/TafferKing451/status/1701722515910127745" target="_blank">swapping to a new engine</a>. CEO John Riccitiello got put back on the radar as everyone's CEO to hate after he had done so well to avoid the spotlight since ruining EA. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23873727/unity-credible-death-threat-offices-closed-pricing-change" target="_blank">Death threats were sent in</a> which forced an office closure. And Unity's stock price plunged in the following days as <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/09/18/3-red-flags-for-unity-softwares-future/" target="_blank">doubts over the company's future were cast</a>.</p>
<p>In response, Unity sent out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-apologises-for-the-new-runtime-fee-say-they-will-make-changes/" target="_blank">feckless apology</a> last night and promised changes. However, they kept hush about what those changes would be, which only served to open them up to more mockery and hate. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1703815783216709995" target="_blank">as reported by Jason Schreier of Bloomberg</a>, Unity has laid out a tentative plan to try and repair its reputation while still wringing money out of devs.</p>
<p>Unity will now limit fees to 4% of revenue, it will only apply to games making over $1 million and that reaching the install threshold will no longer be retroactive. On top of this, instead of using tracking software, devs will now simply self-report how many installs of a game were made. CEO John Riccitiello also emphasized that this would only affect the top 10% of users, though whether that's true or not remains to be seen.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is better good news for devs. The problem, at least on Unity's end, is that they've shattered developer trust. How can people trust them to not try and bring those disastrous policies back when no one is looking?</p>
<p>The idea of taking a small share of revenue was something devs had proposed as a potential monetization idea for Unity. If Unity had done that in the first place it would have avoided this whole embarrassing mess it finds itself in. More embarrassingly for Unity, one could assume that the swap to an install reporting scheme seems to be admitting the install tracking was either unfeasible or a bad idea entirely. Which it is a bad idea, and we should all be glad they're dropping it. But simply put, the whole thing has turned into a gigantic mess that could have been avoided if Unity had simply talked with it's users first about these changes to monetization.</p>
<p>As these plans are tentative however, it remains to be seen whether this is the path Unity goes down or not. Regardless, I think it's safe to say that Unity's days as the game engine of choice for many devs are over.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 optimized for Wayland gaming, plus compositor crash recovery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE developer Nate Graham has two quite interesting updates in regards to the upcoming Plasma 6 desktop release, including some fun optimizations landing. The KDE team are pushing hard for Wayland right now, so it's no surprise to see a focus on improving performance.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/09/15/this-week-in-kde-more-plasma-6-dev/" target="_blank">update</a> posted a few days ago Graham mentions how work was done to improve cursor responsiveness for Plasma Wayland so it's "really very responsive now". The initial bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=472663" target="_blank">report</a> noted how "When the kwin_wayland compositing can't keep up, it doesn't just make the desktop stutter, it also makes the cursor stutter" so this has now been improved. Graham mentioned that work "also substantially improved latency in general, especially for games" which linked to another <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431707" target="_blank">bug report</a> on how certain latency options on Plasma would cause frame drops when gaming so they've improved that too.</p>
<p>Various other improvements are coming like Discover having release data for SteamOS system updates displayed in a "prettier and more comprehensible way", plus the About page in Discover has been refreshed to look better.</p>
<p>They also changed the Activity Switcher shortcut to Meta+A as Meta+Tab is going to be used for something else that's "coming soon".</p>
<p>Lots more fixes came in recently too like Spectacle now properly taking Rectangular Region screenshots correctly when you're using any screen scale factors less than 100%, fixed a rare case where KWin would crash in the Plasma Wayland session when waking from sleep, while updating a lot of Flatpak apps at the same time, discover can no longer exhaust the system’s set of available file handles and then fail and more.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/09/17/so-lets-talk-about-this-wayland-thing/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Graham also goes over what's really going on with Wayland, that's worth a read, giving a bit of a quick history lesson and going into where things stand right now including some issues it has noting that KDE, Valve and Blue Systems have been funding work to improve various areas.</p>
<p>On the subject of Wayland and Qt that you might also find interesting is that developer David Edmundson showed off seriously impressive work in a <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/qt6_wayland_robustness/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and videos "to make Qt clients more robust and seemlessly migrate between compositors, providing resistance against compositor crashes and more". In one video Edmundson showed killing off Kwin and having it properly recover everything that was open:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u4HnwqidYFo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef429e13151e4e033e2d7b0f27fefe30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u4HnwqidYFo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just as exciting is the ability to switch the entire desktop environment, while keeping everything open. In the below video Edmundson starts off on KDE Plasma with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive open and starts just jumping through other desktops with it. Very cool!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JYfzAuRmBjo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/012b56396256772e3cad87e9dc3b8633.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JYfzAuRmBjo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some seriously good stuff going on for Linux and Wayland right now, great to see!</p>

      <title>Gamescope added support for ReShade shaders on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>, the microcompositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck that can also be used on desktop Linux, just got a major upgrade.</p>
<p>What exactly does Gamescope do? Think of it like a piece of software that handles display output. So for the Steam Deck, it's what actually displays your games in Gaming Mode. For desktop Linux you can use it to run games directly to force resolution, AMD FSR, NVIDIA Image Scaling, border-less window, full-screen window and more.</p>
<p>Developer Joshua Ashton has been hacking away on HDR support, some of which has shipped in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 Preview</a> but another fun addition recently is work on support for ReShade. The documentation for Gamescope has now been updated to note it supports a "subset of Reshade effects/shaders" and so this provides an easy way to layer "shader effects (ie. CRT shader, film grain, debugging HDR with histograms, etc) on top of whatever is being displayed in Gamescope without having to hook into the underlying process".</p>
<p>On their Fediverse social media page, they <a href="https://idtech.space/notice/AZkig3bhAe2XaRkgoy" target="_blank">mentioned</a> with some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got Reshade shaders working under Gamescope/SteamOS today!</p>
<p>Which means we can get Lilium/EndlesslyFlowering's amazing HDR Analysis shaders to work on all HDR games on SteamOS.</p>
<p>This will be super useful for users and developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Credit - Joshua Ashton</em></p>
<p>Some other notes from the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is currently no way to set the value of uniforms/options, they will just be their initializer values currently.</p>
<p>Using Reshade effects will increase latency as there will be work performed on the general gfx + compute queue as opposed to only using the realtime async compute queue which can run in tandem with the game's gfx work.</p>
<p>Using Reshade effects is <strong>highly discouraged</strong> for doing simple transformations which can be achieved with LUTs/CTMs which are possible to do in the DC (Display Core) on AMDGPU at scanout time, or with the current regular async compute composite path. The looks system where you can specify your own 3D LUTs would be a better alternative for such transformations.</p>
<p>Pull requests for improving Reshade compatibility support are appreciated.</p>

      <title>Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra adds Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nintendo 3DS emulation is about to get a whole lot better, as Citra <a href="https://citra-emu.org/entry/citra-vulkan-announcement/" target="_blank">now has Vulkan</a> support bringing better performance for players. This follows on from the devs teasing Vulkan back in an <a href="https://citra-emu.org/entry/citra-progress-report-2023-q1/#surprise-announcement" target="_blank">earlier</a> progress report in March.</p>
<p>Joining many other emulators in modernising their rendering systems like Dolphin, Ryujinx, RPCS3 and yuzu. In the announcement they showed the difference with an Intel Core i3-1005G1 going from 75FPS to 115FPS. It's currently in their <a href="https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly/releases" target="_blank">nightly</a> releases and will eventually be in their main downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11969395441695041616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11969395441695041616gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Super Mario 3D Land</em></p>
<p>This brings with it improved Android support, support on macOS once again thanks to translation to Metal via MoltenVK, users on older AMD GPUs and more.</p>
<p>Since it's still early days though, it won't be anywhere close to perfect so you should expect to see issues. They have a few noted things to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do not expect Vulkan to fix old emulation bugs that are not related to graphics or rendering.</li>
<li>Do not expect Vulkan to render games correctly that our OpenGL backend does not render correctly. Aside from OpenGL or Vulkan driver bugs, switching between the APIs shouldn’t show any visual difference. If that is the case for you, please report this to us!</li>
<li>Do not expect Vulkan to be an improvement over OpenGL in every aspect, on every device. Whilst Vulkan provides better performance than OpenGL in most cases, that is not always the case.</li>
<li>As of writing, Vulkan does not have full feature parity with our OpenGL backend. We will list some of the missing features below.</li>
<li>Whilst Vulkan currently has a disk pipeline cache, as well as runtime shader caching, an actual Disk Shader Cache for it is not yet implemented. As such, you may still experience some shader stutter at the start of each session until that is properly implemented.</li>
<li>Recording your gameplay using Video Dumping is not yet implemented.</li>
<li>Texture Filtering and Post-Processing Shaders are not yet implemented.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more projects pick up Vulkan support, should keep it running nicely into the future. Especially when they add in all the features, the performance should be great.</p>

      <title>Unity apologises for the new runtime fee, say they will make changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After leaving developers furious for nearly a whole week after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">recent announcement</a> of making developers pay for game installs, Unity put up a fresh statement. I really do suggest you read that previous link for context, where I went over various issues.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1703547752205218265" target="_blank">statement</a> from Unity posted on X is as follows: "We have heard you. We apologize for the confusion and angst the runtime fee policy we announced on Tuesday caused. We are listening, talking to our team members, community, customers, and partners, and will be making changes to the policy. We will share an update in a couple of days. Thank you for your honest and critical feedback."</p>
<p>So right now game developers have to wait and see what changes Unity come up with. For some, nothing short of entirely reversing it will do. Plenty of developers are already quite unhappy with the latest statement since it has nothing of actual substance after waiting nearly a week.</p>
<p>The problem is, as said by many developers, the trust has been <em>broken</em>. They've shown a total disregard for game developers since they're willing to change the terms on them at any point. Even if they put in protections against that, as shown before, they could just remove them again. How can a company rebuild trust when it has been so badly broken? It certainly will be interesting to see what they actually do.</p>
<p>Looks like we're in for an interesting week ahead for the industry…</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh <strong>1.0.8</strong> version of the Heroes of Might and Magic 2 game engine has been<a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.8" target="_blank"><strong> </strong>released</a> recently and here're some tips about what's new in the <strong>fheroes2 project</strong>.</p>
<p>The most noticeable change every player will notice, is the enhanced look of the <strong>Save/Load file window</strong>. This window was expanded to support much longer filenames and not to be so compressed in size.</p>

<p>The <strong>AI</strong> in this release became smarter during battles and will <strong>kite</strong> their <strong>shooters</strong> if necessary instead of waiting to get hit. On the other hand, on <u>lower difficulties</u> the AI's use of "<em>Dimension door</em>" spell has been given <strong>restrictions</strong>, making these modes easier.<br/>
<br/>
The team spent a lot of time improving multiple aspects of the UI, including <strong>expanding</strong> existing <strong>translations</strong>, adding missing <strong>letters in fonts</strong>, and making more elements <u>translatable</u>. One of the examples of this work is translated <strong>vertical buttons</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176869411694881912gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176869411694881912gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The work on the <strong>Editor</strong> continues. In this release, we completed <strong>terrain connections</strong> logic to make smooth transitions between terrain types. An interesting fact is that the team is working on the translation part for the Editor in parallel. At the time when we make it accessible to the public, you will be able to use the Editor in a language of your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979833711694881930gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979833711694881930gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Besides these major changes, this release contains a lot of small changes to polish the game engine and make the game play even better. Adding High Score for multiplayer game, fixing rendering issues in the Kingdom Overview dialog, speeding up file loading and many more such things are included in this release. All major translations have been updated bringing most of them to 100% coverage.<br/>
<br/>
More than <strong>50 bugs</strong> were fixed for this release.<br/>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.5 now in Preview with HDR, VRR and display colour settings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those who wish to test out the very latest improvements to the Steam Deck, Valve has put up Steam Deck OS 3.5 into Preview now. In the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3686804163591367815" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve go over a big list of new features and fixes, so here's some of what's included.</p>
<p>The most immediate change you'll notice is that Valve tweaked the default display colour settings, as they said it has been adjusted to "emulate the sRGB color gamut, resulting in a slightly warmer and more vibrant color appearance". This is adjustable, with the new display settings being added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native: The native display color appearance (the color rendering for Steam Deck prior to this update).</li>
<li>sRGB: Emulate the sRGB primaries, in a smooth manner that does not introduce gradient clipping.</li>
<li>Boosted: Emulate a wider-gamut display appearance, resulting in increased apparent vibrance. May result in gradient clipping.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/351668591694881214gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/351668591694881214gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that for external displays the Steam Deck now supports HDR, and you can also enable VRR if supported by the USB-C adaptor you're using. Valve also adjusted the Quick Access scaling options, separating them from the filters with added Stretch and Zoom scaling options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5157395231694881327gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5157395231694881327gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus there's some performance improvements with compositing being avoided in additional scenarios, which Valve say will reduce latency and stutter when you have multiple overlays. On top of that they even improved latency in some cases where games / apps render slower than the refresh rate.</p>
<p>There's so much more to it, with this likely being the biggest upgrade for the Steam Deck since release. There's an upgraded graphics driver that has lots of improvements like better performance for Starfield, fixed corruption in Amnesia: The Bunker, fixed launch failures for Immortals of Aveum and Kaiju-A-GoGo and no doubt lots of other fixes.</p>
<p>Some other quick picks from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved sleep resume speed.</li>
<li>Improved Bluetooth connection stability.</li>
<li>The performance overlay can be customized via configuration files.</li>
<li>An upgraded Arch Linux base for the operating system.</li>
<li>An upgrade to the KDE Plasma desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain workloads would exhibit severe CPU performance issues unless SMT was manually disabled.</li>
<li>External storage devices are now auto-mounted when connected to Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve also noted Firmware 116 was released bringing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added voltage offset settings.</li>
<li>Improved robustness of the Firmware Settings Reset chord (Volume Down + Quick-Access + Power) against some boot hang scenarios.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue that would set the processor TDP limit too low causing CPU and GPU frequencies to be stuck at 400 MHz and 200 MHz respectively.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when the charging light would turn back on when plugged in for a while after fully charged.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to get it? Press the STEAM button -&gt; go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; System Update Channel and pick Preview. It will then reboot, then hit Check For Updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12306241081694881103gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12306241081694881103gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16131353281694881104gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16131353281694881104gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's in Preview, it means it's ready enough for anyone to try it out and they will send it as a Stable update to all users once it's had more testing.</p>
<p>What's your favourite addition in this update?</p>

      <title>qomp2 is an artful reimagining of Pong that looks pretty wild</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sequel to the qomp, a minimilist and supremely clever reimagining of Pong was not on my bingo card but here we are. Atari and Graphite Lab recently revealed qomp2. The first game in the series qomp was short but a damn fine experience, and actually one of my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/qomp-is-a-brilliant-example-of-minimalist-mechanics-and-a-fantastic-idea/" target="_blank">indie highlights from 2021</a> because it really was fun. So a proper full expansive follow-up sounds great to me.</p>
<p>qomp2 captures the simplicity of Pong by giving players only two buttons to navigate a series of labyrinthine levels packed with “harder than they look” challenges. Stepping into the spherical body of the renegade runaway, players will ping-pong their way through the dangerous, minimalistic world of qomp2. With a variety of enemies and bosses helping to mark the journey, the escapee will adventure through 30 challenging levels across four distinct worlds.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tah154H6i1o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7123b6223d236c9124c0d19fceffe15b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tah154H6i1o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cerebral Puzzling: The simple, two-button controls belie complex and compelling gameplay. Use your reflexes to think ahead and master 30 tricky levels. Hidden collectibles on the map push you to explore every inch of the creatively rich minimalist environment.</li>
<li>Bounce Between Emotions: qomp2 is an enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly with simple animations, effects, and the game mechanics themselves — a surprising twist based on the classic Pong.</li>
<li>Surprises Galore: If the game’s premise doesn’t raise an eyebrow, just wait until you dive into the challenges, which get increasingly difficult as you master new aspects of gameplay. And don’t worry, death is not the end in this arcade-inspired world. Quick respawn makes sure you’re back in the action in seconds.</li>
<li>Bountiful Bosses: Four bosses block your escape at the end of each world. Use your newfound skills to master their attacks and defenses in order to move on. Much like a real game of Pong, you must be prepared to defend your position!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2243510/qomp2/" target="_blank">qomp2 on Steam</a>. It will release in 2024 with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Secret underwater Bees? The APICO 3.0 update sounds interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>APICO is a really sweet game about saving and breeding Bees, and the free 3.0 update is now set for flight on September 26th with plenty of fun sounding additions. Taking ideas from real-life with a bit of fantasy mixed in, APICO blends together beekeeping, gardening, crafting and exploration into a cute relaxing gem. A portion of the proceeds from sales also goes towards bee conservation.</p>
<p>Here's what they say will be in the 3.0 update:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets the 2.0 update on September 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED have now revealed the 2.0 update for Cyberpunk 2077 releases on September 21st, plus there's a new cinematic trailer for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC that releases September 26th.</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Verified, and works great on desktop Linux, but will that change with the huge upgrade and DLC? Only time will tell, hopefully there won't be many issues but I'll be taking a look at the update at release to see how it runs and let you know.</p>
<p>Some of what's coming to the 2.0 update includes an overhaul to the perk system, vehicle combat, an updated police system, various AI improvements, and much more. It's going to make it feel like a very different game. Check out the new 2.0 update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="odf7Q8Plcvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e531caab9eabfbe5c1221a7553bd6080.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/odf7Q8Plcvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the cinematic trailer for the Phantom Liberty DLC which adds in a whole new area with a new story, a new skill tree and much more:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sJbexcm4Trk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/412a17a72618044558531c908477c164.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sJbexcm4Trk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers also released a new <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/build-planner" target="_blank">build planner</a>, since it's such a big overhaul so you can plan ahead as you'll be given a one-time chance to redistribute all your points when you jump in after the 2.0 update lands.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to them both? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>You can pre-order the DLC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138330/Cyberpunk_2077_Phantom_Liberty/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store (GOG Key)</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/cyberpunk_2077_phantom_liberty?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> direct.</p>

      <title>Heretic&#39;s Fork is an unholy blending of deck-building and tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I think my love for Vampire Survivor like games has ended, and a new relationship has been made with Heretic's Fork because it's simply brilliant. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Merging together a deck-builder with a tower defense game isn't that unusual, but what it does with it is fantastic. Your job as Hell's Manager is to punish sinners. You do so through their weird computer system, the Heretic's Fork, which has you go through a tower defense game where you place down towers and buildings that spawn units, while continually upgrading them as it constantly ramps up the difficulty. You only get the middle of the map, with enemies constantly swarming in around you and it's chaos.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13518015911694703783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13518015911694703783gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19959801151694703785gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19959801151694703785gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictured to enlarge them.</em></p>
<p>It's sort-of turn based because as your towers and creatures take down enemies, the bar on the right fills up to then start a new "turn". This is where you will pick your cards to place down towers, units, upgrades, combine cards to upgrade them, banish useless cards so they don't come back during a run and more. However, as you're doing all this, time is only slowed down — so you can't take your sweet time, you need to get going as it's all still going on in the background just a lot slower.</p>
<p>Thankfully there <em>is</em> a pause button if you need a breather, and you can also speed it up if you find the initial speed a little too slow, although I would like to see another additional speed to breeze through the start.</p>
<p>Outside of the tower defense, there's plenty of meta features going on with the computer system. You have card upgrades, character unlocks, a hellish version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant" target="_blank">clippy</a> constantly telling you things and more. It's delightfully devilish in giving you that burning feeling of needing not just one more run, but ten more runs. It will absolutely suck you in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I692_iRf6SY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c653a139d13bdd8c27a3edea9a4ccfb0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I692_iRf6SY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You'll want to unlock that second character as soon as you can too, having more tower slots unlocked from the start is incredibly useful to get further into a run to earn more money to then use to buy more things in the meta computer desktop section. Oh, and the second character can lock a card each turn if you have the energy for it too - very useful.</p>
<p>I'm no stranger to tower defense games, with my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/send-help-as-i-have-discovered-bloons-td-6/" target="_blank">previous favourite being Bloons TD 6</a> but this is like if Bloons had a serious nightmare that made it wake up sweating and screaming. It's just as deliciously addictive, if not more. It can take a little while to properly get into it, especially as the game sprinkles in the extra meta features as you play through and learning about the different upgrades and combinations takes a while. But as you play more, you get a lot more out of it, as you start to see the different stages and different types of enemies as you come up with ways to take them down.</p>
<p>Once you start getting quite a few runs in, and build up some monies, the game will continue to expand. There's a shop where you can buy more cards and trust me, you'll want to as some of them are quite powerful and you'll also start gaining new types of towers here too — but you won't know what they are until you buy them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5842239541694713106gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5842239541694713106gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This feels like the first time discovering <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/loop-hero-is-out-now-and-im-going-to-need-help-to-tear-myself-away-from-it/" target="_blank">Loop Hero</a> all over again, another game where plenty of it puts you in the backseat as you watch it all unfold. This is why I love indie developers, they make some of the coolest most unique experiences around that won't make your wallet bleed. Oh, and the music absolutely slaps too.</p>
<p>During a run you're not only dealing with your cards though. At the end of a section, you also get to pick a special upgrade like a big boost to HP regeneration, another tower slot, a big boost to tower attack power and much more. Additionally, some cards will give you active abilities like adding to your HP, placing down an area to curse enemies and more and these abilities can be set to auto-fire when ready if you wish. There's just so many little bits that add up to a really entertaining time.</p>
<p>Heretic's Fork also has leaderboards to let you see how you stack up against your friends. So GamingOnLinux contributor Scaine doesn't know it yet, but we're now officially locked in a battle for who can punish the most sinners. Even if it takes me all night, I will take the crown.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2819363291694715370gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2819363291694715370gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On Linux desktop it works without any issues with Proton Experimental. Perfect performance, and no problems through any part as far as I can tell. For Steam Deck, it doesn't have controller support, but that's actually not a problem at all since the controls are just simply moving a mouse around a little bit so it also works pretty much to perfection on Steam Deck too. Some of the text on Steam Deck is a little small but not a big problem here.</p>
<p>I find the more I play, the more it tickles my brain in a similar way the Vampire Survivors once did. I need to play more, I need to find some ridiculous tower combinations and upgrade them to become as powerful as the devil himself.</p>
<p>There's not many times in the history of this website where I will tell you so crystal clearly to just go and buy the damn game but here we are: go and buy Heretic's Fork. It's awesome. My new favourite game to kill time with and ignore emails over.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2181610/Heretics_Fork/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. For under £10 this is an absolute gem.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Valve puts the Steam Deck and Dock on sale again, get up to 20% off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Joining the Steam 20 year celebration, the Steam Deck and Docking Station are now discounted across all three models when buying brand new from Valve.</p>
<p>This is only the third time they've ever been on sale, and stock tends to run out quite quickly whenever there's a discount so if you've been sitting on the fence now would be a good time to pick one up. It's an incredibly versatile Linux machine and my favourite gaming device.</p>
<ul>
<li>64GB - 10% off (£314.10 / $359)</li>
<li>256GB - 15% off (£390.15 / $450)</li>
<li>512GB - 20% off (£455.20 / $519)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Docking Station also 20% off at £63.20 / $71.20.</p>
<p>A good time for another reason, as last month Deck Verified hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/over-11000-games-now-rated-steam-deck-playable/" target="_blank">over 11,000 titles playable</a>. That's only what Valve has directly tested though, plenty more will run just fine. From some of the latest AAA games, indie games to classics from many years ago - a lot is possible to run on it. Even some great emulators too with the help of projects like <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> and <a href="https://retrodeck.net/" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a>.</p>
<p>Buy the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Dock here</a>. Additionally the Steam Deck is also on sale in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">via Komodo</a>.</p>
<p>The sale lasts until September 21st while stock lasts.</p>

      <title>Unity attempt to clarify new install fees as developers revolt</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The saga with the Unity game engine continues, after their completely botched announcement of a new fee system game developers will need to pay.</p>
<p>Just to briefly bring you up to speed from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">the previous article</a>: once developers hit <em>both</em> a revenue and install threshold for their games, they will then need to pay Unity for <em>each</em> install after the threshold is met. For example: based on their "standard rate" on Unity Personal if developers made at least $200K in the last 12 months, and had at least 200,000 total game installs, each install after would cost them $0.20 per new install but it's less on Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise (and less again on each when install milestones are hit).</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that Unity <em>very</em> badly explained it, although the whole idea just doesn't seem to be very good. One big issue is that this change is <em>retroactive</em> for <em>existing</em> released games. So any game currently on the market that uses Unity will need to begin paying for each time a new player installs their game, if they're over those thresholds after January 1st, 2024.</p>
<p>It didn't help that when Unity tried to clarify these details, initially they said that re-installs of games will count towards the installs <em>and</em> that would include installs on new hardware. They've since clarified <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/" target="_blank">again</a> to say it's only for the "first install and we have no desire to charge for the same person doing ongoing installs".</p>
<p>In another clarification <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1702077049425596900" target="_blank">post</a> on social network X, Unity mentioned "more than 90% of our customers will not be affected by this change", which means at least 90% of Unity users <em>don't</em> make $200K a year and have fewer than 200K installs total at a minimum. <em>Not exactly the best advert for their game engine.</em> They also clarified these details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How we define and count installs: Assuming the install and revenue thresholds are met, we will only count net new installs on any device starting Jan 1, 2024. Additionally, developers are not responsible for paying a runtime fee on:<br/>
- Re-install charges - we are not going to charge a fee for re-installs.<br/>
- Fraudulent installs charges - we are not going to charge a fee for fraudulent installs. We will work directly with you on cases where fraud or botnets are suspected of malicious intent.<br/>
- Trials, partial play demos, and automation installs (devops) charges - we are not going to count these toward your install count. Early access games are not considered demos.<br/>
- Web and streaming games - we are not going to count web and streaming games toward your install count either.<br/>
- Charity-related installs - the pricing change and install count will not be applied to your charity bundles/initiatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and their updated <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">FAQ</a> <em>still</em> claims that different devices are a different install so they will count again. So if you switch between a PC, a laptop, a Steam Deck, ROG Ally - or other devices, developers will have to pay each time. I don't need to explain why that's ridiculous do I? Why should a game developer pay their game engine multiple times just because a user who purchased their game installed it in more than one place. Absolute idiocy.</p>
<p>The big problem is: how are they tracking these installs? Well, they <em>won't</em> actually tell anyone. They just <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1701689241456021607" target="_blank">claim</a> "We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won’t go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of the number of times the runtime is distributed for a given project." — so you have to trust them.</p>
<p>According to Facepunch developer Alistair McFarlane on <a href="https://twitter.com/Alistair_McF/status/1701997285167489522" target="_blank">X</a>, "The Rust cheat community already has a working reinstall script for Rust with a unique HW spoofer on each install". No doubt there will be more like it. Detecting and accounting for spoofed installs is going to be a nightmare for developers by the looks of it.</p>
<p>Even with the clarifications, and even if Unity eventually did a big u-turn on all this, it doesn't change that the trust is broken to just spring such a complete overhaul to their fee system including making it retroactive. Compounding that issue is how Unity previously said in <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform" target="_blank">2019</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.</p>
<p>In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will host TOS changes on Github to give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when. The link is https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That GitHub was taken down but hey, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220716084623/https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService" target="_blank">Wayback Machine archive</a> exists. However, it was also made clear in their <a href="https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/software-legacy" target="_blank">legacy TOS</a> as well when you read "if the Updated Terms adversely impact your rights, you may elect to continue to use any current-year versions of the Unity Software (e.g., 2018.x and 2018.y and any Long Term Supported (LTS) versions for that current-year release) according to the terms that applied just prior to the Updated Terms" but this TOS was <em>replaced</em> in October 13, 2022 with a <a href="https://unity.com/legal/editor-terms-of-service/software" target="_blank">new TOS</a> that entirely <em>removes</em> this protection for developers. <em>Nice bait and switch there Unity.</em></p>
<p>Developers certainly aren't pleased, <em>pissed-off</em> would be an massive understatement, with many putting out statements calling for Unity to reverse the whole thing, some even mentioning they will remove their games. Lots of developers are now looking at Godot, Unreal, Game Maker and other engines to see if they can switch for their next or existing projects too.</p>
<p>Some choice picks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega Crit, developer of Slay the Spire, with their statement on X <a href="https://twitter.com/MegaCrit/status/1702077576209207611" target="_blank">noting</a> that they will switch game engine unless it's entirely reversed and that "We have never made a public statement before. That is how badly you fucked up.".</li>
<li>Cult of the Lamb developers <a href="https://twitter.com/cultofthelamb/status/1701715971663425897" target="_blank">say</a> they will delete the game on January 1st.</li>
<li>Publisher Devolver Digital now <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1701685282129539485" target="_blank">say</a> to "Definitely include what engine you’re using in game pitches.", as no doubt this install fee will heavily complicate the developer-publisher relationship with tracking it accurately across so many places.</li>
<li>Developer Rami Ismail <a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1701656537352028373" target="_blank">mentions</a> an important bit in a thread on X, on how "Hey but seriously, if you're a marginalized dev at risk of hate brigading and your Unity game is available on any DRM-free platform, basically you're utterly fucked at this point unless this gets reversed. There's a moral imperative to tell Unity leadership to get fucked here.".<br/>
<em>Given how, noted above, Rust cheaters already have a hardware spoofer it's not looking good.</em></li>
<li>Garry Newman of Facepunch said "Unity can get fucked" in a <a href="https://garry.net/posts/unity-can-get-fucked" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Innersloth, developer of Among Us, <a href="https://twitter.com/InnerslothDevs/status/1701731398498013575" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they would "delay content and features our players actually want to port our game elsewhere".</li>
<li>Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft Games wrote a blog post titled "<a href="https://insertcredit.com/opinion/unity/" target="_blank">The death of unity</a>" that mentions "But now I can say, unequivocally, if you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. If you started a project 4 months ago, it's worth switching to something else. Unity is quite simply not a company to be trusted."</li>
</ul>
<p>I could pull out hundreds more, but you get the idea. It's not small names being annoyed by this, it seems like one of the few times almost the entire industry has rallied around something like this. Even Geoff Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1701791508285063587" target="_blank">replied</a> to Unity on X to say "What a joke.".</p>
<p>Worse still, is that developers at Unity did reportedly give <a href="https://twitter.com/georgebsocial/status/1701678249086992478" target="_blank">their concerns</a> about the announcement which were ignored.</p>
<p>The reality is that install tracking will be a nightmare. It's something that might sound good in theory, but it has so many problems it just seems like it wasn't really properly thought-through.</p>

      <title>VKDoom is a ZDoom-based source port with a focus on Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is pretty fun to see! The ZDoom / GZDoom family is expanding with VKDoom, a new source-port that has a focus on expanded Vulkan support and modern rendering. Now it's worth noting that GZDoom already supports Vulkan, but VKDoom has a focus on making the Vulkan support much more modern with advanced rendering features for modern GPUs.</p>
<p>Currently the official site doesn't go into a lot of detail about it since it's quite new. What we do know is that VKDoom is being synced with the main GZDoom as they work on it, so all the GZDoom modding and editing features should work out of the box.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18661676511694628893gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18661676511694628893gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113270/DISDAIN/" target="_blank">DISDAIN</a> an upcoming fast-paced, visceral retro-styled first person shooter built on VKDoom by the people making VKDoom. It's launching sometime "soon" with Linux support.</p>
<p>Some features it has from their <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/VKDoom" target="_blank">Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All features from latest version of mainline GZDoom (<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ACS" target="_blank">ACS</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZScript" target="_blank">ZScript</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=ZMusic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank">ZMusic</a> etc)</li>
<li>Vulkan based renderer:
<ul>
<li>Raytraced baked lightmaps (produced from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZDRay" target="_blank">ZDRay</a>)</li>
<li>Raytraced dynamic shadows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DEHEXTRA" target="_blank">DEHEXTRA</a> standard</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_1" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 1</a> style light coronas</li>
<li>Modified defaults as per community feedback (like None - Linear texture filtering and more optimized defaults to better represent the IWAD games - full list here <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/VkDoom/commit/896102c1793e565cb9832d4b2ecc5edf0e41a5c6" target="_blank">https://github.com/dpjudas/VkDoom/commit/896102c1793e565cb9832d4b2ecc5edf0e41a5c6</a>)</li>
<li>Hitbox rendering with r_showhitbox</li>
<li>Alternate mouse cursors for the IWAD games</li>
<li><a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZScript" target="_blank">ZScript</a> extensions related to save games and automap access</li>
<li>New <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MAPINFO" target="_blank">MAPINFO</a> property NoAutoSaveOnEnter, and a CHANGELEVEL_NOAUTOSAVE flag for ChangeLevel (both ZScript and ACS) - that disables the hardcoded saves when entering a map</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said they will also continue to push code back to GZDoom so "eventually GZDoom will inherit much of the technology on display in VKDoom". For now, it seems it was easier to get all the advanced features done in a fork.</p>
<p>In regards to a question about Linux builds being available or needing to be built manually the official VKDoom account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/VKDoomEngine/status/1701577696529289456" target="_blank">replied</a>: "There will be, eventually. There's still lots of work to be done on other parts of the engine currently, so we can't spare enough manpower to take care of Linux and Mac yet. Stay tuned!"</p>

      <title>Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 &#39;Faye&#39; enters Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who want a stable Linux distribution with the Cinnamon desktop, Linux Mint Debian Edition seems like a nice choice and the latest release is <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4562" target="_blank">now in Beta</a>. It should be much the same as the normal Linux Mint distribution, but directly based on Debian instead of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Their goal with it is to ensure Linux Mint could carry on, in the event of something problematic happening with Ubuntu, they say it's "also one of our development targets, to guarantee the software we develop is compatible outside of Ubuntu".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17961074521694620422gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17961074521694620422gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - LMDE 6 "Faye"</p>
<p>Based upon Debian 12 "Bookworm", it should be a nice upgrade for anyone who was still using LMDE 5. The Mint team don't really go into any detail on what exactly has changed yet, and the <a href="https://linuxmint.com/rel_faye.php" target="_blank">release notes</a> are simply going over some known issues. It should be largely the same as the most recent main Linux Mint release like Cinnamon 5.8 desktop, updated apps, an improved look and feel, full support for HEIF and AVIF image files, a resizable main menu, multi-threaded thumbnails for the Nemo file manager and more.</p>
<p>Do you use LMDE? Let us know why in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck not picking up your SD Card? Check for the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Valve recently launched a stable Steam Client update for desktop and Steam Deck, along with the recent SteamOS 3.4.10 release - SD Cards became a bit problematic.</p>
<p>For some reason, SD Cards just wouldn't appear. Sometimes you could pull it out and put it back in and it would appear, other times you might need a reboot. Quite a nuisance, especially when this would happen every time you turned on your Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve just <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3687940304703787199?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">released</a> another Steam Deck update that notes they "Fixed a failure to recognize the microSD card after a system reboot.". So if you've been having issues make sure you press the STEAM button -&gt; Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Check For Updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1837265021694602933gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1837265021694602933gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to quickly respond to such annoying issues. Now where's SteamOS 3.5 huh?</p>

      <title>Steam goes green as Valve celebrate 20 years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we already marked the anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/happy-birthday-to-steam-as-it-turned-20-today/" target="_blank">Steam turning 20 in a previous article</a>, Valve has now done their own announcement along with turning a bit green.</p>
<p>Valve has playfully updated the Steam store to match the original colour scheme of Steam when it launched, and it all looks a bit retro. Plus there's a fun <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam20?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank">timeline of events</a>, which goes over various points in Steam's history along with the top games each year.</p>
<p>Almost all Valve games are now on sale too (there's a couple that aren't right now like Half-Life: Alyx - but it may just be a bit delayed). No big announcements so far, but Valve did say on the timeline that Counter-Strike 2 will be launching "soon". On top of that there's some additions to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/event/sale_steam20" target="_blank">Points Shop</a> and a quick little thank you video below:</p>

      <title>The open source Godot Engine has a new Godot Development Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The same day that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">Unity confused all their developers</a> with a new pay per user install revenue model, the team behind the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/" target="_blank">Godot Engine just announced</a> their new <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Development Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Godot Engine is free, open source and has no revenue sharing because you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. However, they still need to fund developers working on it. So now they're officially properly launching a direct way where anyone can contribute to Godot Engine financially.</p>
<p>According to their website at time of writing they have €25,591 per month coming in from this fund. They do also get £9,587 a month from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine" target="_blank">Patreon</a> but they're hoping to move over to their direct funding. There's also less fees for their direct funding platform compared to the likes of Patreon, so more of the money will go directly into Godot development.</p>
<p>As stated in their announcement: "By relying more on recurring user-funded contributions and company sponsorships, we reduce our dependence on large one-time grants from corporations. This financial independence empowers us to prioritize the needs and interests of our community and the open source principles at the core of our projects. Your help ensures that we can create our own journey, uphold our core values, and continue to evolve the engine in ways that truly benefit you, the users."</p>

      <title>Western Digital announce the SN770M NVMe for handhelds like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a storage upgrade for your Steam Deck, ROG Ally or other handheld? Western Digital are the latest to enter the game with their new WD_BLACK SN770M NVMe SSD.</p>
<p>Available in 512GB, 1TB and 2TB it seems like a great upgrade to get more space. While their actual press release didn't mention the Steam Deck, and focused more on the ROG Ally, their actual <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-black-sn770m-nvme-ssd#WDBDNH5000ABK-WRSN" target="_blank">store page</a> clearly mentions the compatibility with the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>From the press release: "With game sizes continually becoming larger, it's easy for handheld game consoles to fill up over time with new games and regular updates," said Eric Spanneut, vice president of client SSDs for Western Digital. "The new WD_BLACK SN770M NVMe SSD boosts available storage up to 2TB and is specifically designed to handle the peak performance of demanding games for handheld gaming PCs."</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">The drives come with a 5 year limited warranty with the 512GB model available directly through WD and other retailers, the 1TB is only available direct from WD and for now the 2TB model is exclusive to Best Buy. The specs also vary across the models with differing read and write performance.</span></p>
<p>Not just for handheld gaming though, there's a number of other devices out there with a M.2 2230 slot which is becoming steadily more popular for the size of it which really does give us some tiny cards to slot in.</p>
<p>A few other companies have also been stocking a few different M.2 2230 models that I've covered in the past including SCAN UK with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/scan-uk-to-offer-ssd-upgrades-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">multiple</a><small>(1)</small> <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/scan-uk-now-selling-a-wd-1tb-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">models</a><small>(2)</small>, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/framework-begin-offering-2tb-ssd-upgrades-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Framework</a>.</p>

      <title>Unity introduces new fees for game devs based on revenue and game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unity Technologies have announced an overhaul to their fees for game developers, which now includes tracking game installs and revenue. <em>Update notes: future updates will be at the bottom of the article.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates" target="_blank">announcement</a> they call it the Unity Runtime Fee, which is based upon a qualifying game being downloaded by users. They said they chose it because they believe "an initial install-based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement, unlike a revenue share". Given that it's a flat-fee though, this will likely sting game devs who sell games at a lower cost since this fee will be on top of all their other fees (like Steam's 30% cut for example).</p>
<p>What games will be hit? As they explained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Personal </strong> and <strong>Unity Plus: </strong>Those that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong> and <strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan comes into place on January 1st, 2024 and they gave this breakdown of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10657751081694524453gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10657751081694524453gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Note: Unity said it won't be applied retroactively when you hit the cap, the install fee is charged after the threshholds have been met for additional installs. However, it <em>will</em> apply to games already on the market. However, games that do not hit the thresholds or aren't monetised at all will <em>not</em> be required to pay the fees.</p>
<p>This is on top of the Unity subscription developers already pay, although Unity will be removing the annual revenue limit on the Unity Personal plan when this launches. For anyone on Unity Pro though, for example, the above is on top of the subscription cost which is $2,040 per year or $185 a month per-person.</p>
<p>One of the concerns with this is from a privacy standpoint: how exactly will they be tracking this? Since they will be invoicing developers directly based on their install tracking. They don't really make that clear. There's various other problems that Unity need to make clear. As just one example - what about keys for a game in a charity bundle, how are they going to be counted if the game is paid but they're given away? What about if there's a pirated version, how are they tracking legit paid installs? There's probably numerous other examples where it may cause problems.</p>
<p>Another change buried in the FAQ is that people on the Unity Personal plan need internet access to continue to use Unity. If you lose internet, you can only continue using it for 3 days while offline. </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: since there's been a huge uproar from Unity developers, especially on their official Unity forum, one of their team has <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/page-2#post-9289318" target="_blank">clarified</a> some details about the monthly rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ya, sorry, I get how this wording is confusing. So, let's say you have your 1,000,001th install, officially pushing you over the cap. You will have a fee of 15 cents. You will not pay that 15cents every month. Just a single time. The monthly thing is to indicate a monthly assessment to see where your installs are and revenue is to see if you had more installs or dropped below the cap. Does that help?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another post, they also <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/page-9#post-9290938" target="_blank">clarified</a> it's "Per game / project".</p>
<p><strong>Update #2</strong>: On social network X, Unity put up this <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1701650081403842851" target="_blank">statement</a> I've copied below in case you can't access X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we announced a change to our business model which includes new additions to our subscription plans, and the introduction of a Runtime fee. We wanted to provide clarifying answers to the top questions most of you are asking.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a price increase and it will only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users.</p>
<p>Today, a large majority of Unity Editor users are currently not paying anything and will not be affected by this change. The Unity Runtime fee will not impact the majority of our developers.</p>
<p>The developers who will be impacted are generally those who have successful games and are generating revenue way above the thresholds we outlined in our blog. This means that developers who are still building their business and growing the audience of their games will not pay a fee. The program was designed specifically this way to ensure developers could find success before the install fee takes effect.</p>
<p>We want to be clear that the counter for Unity Runtime fee installs starts on January 1, 2024 - it is not retroactive or perpetual. We will charge once for a new install; not an ongoing perpetual license royalty, like revenue share.</p>
<p>We looked for ways to lessen the impact on developers, and provide ways to bring the Runtime fee to zero. If you’re using any of our ad products, Unity Gaming Services or cloud services, etc. please contact us to discuss discounts.</p>
<p>We are actively listening to and following your questions closely. Please review our FAQ (<a href="https://on.unity.com/3PAiqHH" target="_blank">https://on.unity.com/3PAiqHH</a>) on today’s announcement. We also invite you to continue to discuss these changes with us on our forums: <a href="https://on.unity.com/3RmyLRx" target="_blank">https://on.unity.com/3RmyLRx</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update #3 13/09/2023</strong>: Unity have now compiled a list of common questions and answers in their <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/" target="_blank">official forum post</a>, which doesn't seem to have made things any better. In fact, it only confirmed some of the worst fears from developers. Like this for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If a user reinstalls/redownloads a game / changes their hardware, will that count as multiple installs?<br/>
A: Yes. The creator will need to pay for all future installs. The reason is that Unity doesn’t receive end-player information, just aggregate data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at the current time with their plan, developers need to pay each time you uninstall and re-install. And each time you install on a different device. As they briefly explained there, they have no way to tell the actual difference on reinstalls since it's just aggregate data.</p>
<p>Then there's this too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If a game that's made enough money to be over the threshold has a demo of the same game, do installs of the demo also induce a charge?<br/>
A: If it's early access, Beta, or a demo of the full game then yes. If you can get from the demo to a full game then yes. If it's not, like a single level that can't upgrade then no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that if developers have a demo for their game, and this game is over both the install and revenue threshold, if the demo progress carries over into the full game the demo itself is classed as another install that will cost developers money (even if the demo player doesn't buy the game).</p>
<p>As for how Unity are tracking installs, especially for things like pirated installs and people having a grudge against a developer to spin up lots of reinstalls (it will happen…), Unity basically tell you to trust their black-box proprietary tech on that (from their FAQ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do already have fraud detection practices in our Ads technology which is solving a similar problem, so we will leverage that know-how as a starting point. We recognize that users will have concerns about this and we will make available a process for them to submit their concerns to our fraud compliance team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from their <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1701689241456021607" target="_blank">replies</a> on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won’t go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of the number of times the runtime is distributed for a given project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So it's just a "trust me bro" situation here for developers.</em></p>
<p>A lot of developers are absolutely furious at Unity. Not just because it has been communicated so badly, and because even just based on that one answer above the cost to developers will be ridiculous, but because Unity just pulled the rug from under developers with entirely new terms even for existing games. Even if they reverse course, it shows that Unity are willing to change anything at any time which is incredibly risky for developers embarking on multi-year game development. <a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1701864575031775516" target="_blank">This thread</a> on X from respected developer Rami Ismail highlights things quite well.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps it's time to take a look at the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>?</em></p>

      <title>Happy Birthday to Steam as it turned 20 today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where has all that time gone? It's pretty hard to believe that it was 20 years ago that Steam arrived, and with it that glorious green interface.</p>
<p>They weren't even close to being the first digital store to provide games, but requiring Steam to run Half-Life 2 regardless of digital purchase or a boxed copy was likely the defining moment that helped push it to success for Valve. This was likely my own introduction to Steam as well, back in the day where my PC could only <em>just</em> about run Half-Life 2 when you had long loading screens between sections. How time flies huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10139832541694519337gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10139832541694519337gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Steam homepage back in 2004 after Half-Life 2 released</em></p>
<p>Valve has a long colourful history of expanding Steam from a basic launcher to a full store and later adding in the Steam Workshop, Early Access, Greenlight, Steam Direct, User Reviews, Virtual Reality, Steam Machines, Steam Deck, Remote Play, Points Shop, Movies and TV, Soundtracks and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Not everything Valve has tried went well like the original Steam Machines, and killing off their ambitions for non-gaming video content but they keep on trying and expanding and it seems there's really no stopping it. It grows every year with Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-had-83000-new-customers-every-day-in-2022/" target="_blank">2022 overview</a> noting they had seen 83,000 new first-time purchasers every day of the year.</p>
<p>Naturally, without Steam and Valve, Linux gaming wouldn't be where it is today so we're doubly thankful for its existence. Just look at how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/5-years-ago-valve-released-proton-forever-changing-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Valve's Proton has changed things</a> in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>Whatever will they announce next — more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/more-teasers-appear-for-upcoming-valve-hardware/" target="_blank">new hardware perhaps</a>?</p>
<p><em>Do you have any especially fond memories of Steam over the years? Share them in the comments.</em></p>

      <title>Embracer&#39;s troubles continue as they may sell off Borderlands dev Gearbox </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group got a little too big it seems, and there's no such thing as too big to fail. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/embracer-closes-volition-developer-of-freespace-red-faction-saints-row/" target="_blank">shutting down Volition</a>, it appears Embracer may be about to sell off Borderlands developer Gearbox.</p>
<p>Originally reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/swedens-embracer-weighs-options-borderlands-maker-gearbox-entertainment-sources-2023-09-11/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which has now been backed up by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/embracer-group-looks-to-sell-video-game-studio-gearbox" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> who have seen an internal Gearbox email talking about it. It doesn't seem like they've settled on anything right now though, they're exploring what options they have.</p>
<p>This is all after Embracer Group <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">announced</a> a big restructuring program after a previous $2 billion deal they were clearly banking on didn't happen. Turns out that deal was with the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group, as reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" target="_blank">Axios</a>.</p>

<p>That's not all, as Rainbow Studios developer of the MX vs ATV series has also been hit by layoffs as Embracer continue cutting costs as confirmed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomasctobin_its-definitely-been-a-wild-year-so-far-activity-7103385035537326082-ceQB/" target="_blank">by</a><small>(1)</small> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mollycuddihy_molly-cuddihy-activity-7104258552172609536-sXgi/" target="_blank">multiple</a><small>(2)</small> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zac-bogner-2520a0a3_hi-all-i-am-looking-for-a-new-role-after-activity-7104856675362209792-K8db/" target="_blank">staffers</a><small>(3)</small> on their LinkedIn pages.</p>
<p>This is part of the problem with the massive consolidation of the games industry. These big funding groups buy up various developers and publishers which often control numerous other developers and publishers. So when there's a problem at the top, any studio below can be on the chopping block.</p>

      <title>Stellaris 3.9 &#39;Caelum&#39; free update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have released the latest free update to Stellaris with 3.9 "Caelum". It's a pretty big one too, with a rather long list of changes. Easily one of my favourite space strategy games.</p>
<p>Some of the highlight new features includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Habitats (needs Utopia or Federations) - Habitats have been limited to one per system, but a variety of orbitals can now be constructed around planetary bodies to expand the liveable space and resources available to the Habitat Central Complex.</li>
<li>Softer Leader Cap - Leader Experience Gain while over Leader Cap now follows a nonlinear curve that will never reach 0% Experience Gain.</li>
<li>Traders, Not Traitors! - Reworked Trade Jobs, adding a new Specialist Trader Job, which takes the place of the Merchant Ruler job in most places. Clerks now produce slightly more amenities, and slightly less trade value, rebalanced Trade Buildings, and many traditions that affected Trade.</li>
<li>Beep Boop More Origins - Machine Intelligences and Hiveminds can now choose more Origins than ever before, with the ability to choose the Common Ground, Hegemony, Lost Colony, or Void Dwellers Origins (Hive-Minds only).</li>
<li>The Kaleidoscope - A powerful energy parasite that may infect your power grid. Will you indulge this creature, or destroy it?</li>
<li>And More - New Story Events, Bug Fixes, Performance, Al, and Modding Improvements, and more!</li>
</ul>

<p>The full update notes can be <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/dev-team-3-9-caelum-released-checksum-629c.1598541/" target="_blank">viewed here</a>. They're really quite long! There's also a bunch of new addition for the various Species Packs as well, as Paradox continue adding content and features to the base game as well as the various DLC.</p>
<p>Seems like it's a good time to start up a fresh game of Stellaris, see you in another 100 hours.</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton v2.10 brings various game fixes, DirectStorage additions and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VKD3D-Proton, the tool that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for Steam Play Proton, has a brand new release out with version 2.10 and it's an exciting one. And hey, I'm actually on time with this news unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/dxvk-2-3-has-game-fixes-for-the-sims-2-tomb-raider-anniversary-far-cry-2/" target="_blank">DXVK v2.3</a>…</p>
<p>There's some pretty great stuff included in this release including DirectStorage MetaCommands, which brings support for GPU accelerated GDeflate compression, which they said has been shown to work in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</p>
<p>Also hooked up is NV_device_generated_commands_compute, that helps with Starfield since its use of ExecuteIndirect "hammers multi-dispatch COMPUTE + root parameter changes", previously they were using a "very slow" workaround. So Starfield should work better with this, although it's only enabled on AMD RADV right now due to driver issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3986140631694442461gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3986140631694442461gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Starfield on Kubuntu Linux with Proton Experimental</em></p>
<p>Also included is in this release is Enhanced Barriers, but there's no games shipping with it so it's not well tested yet.</p>
<p>There's plenty of fixes and workarounds for games and game engines too including issues solved for: Star Wars Battlefront II, Ashes of the Singularity, fixed mesh shaders in Unreal Engine 5, fixes for some Xenia bugs (xbox 360 emulator), Armored Core VI, Age of Wonders 4, Starfield, Halo Infinite, Street Fighter 6, Resident Evil 4, Monster Hunter Rise and others.</p>
<p>Some of the other stuff included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Root Signature version 1.2</li>
<li>Implement Shader Model 6.7
<ul>
<li>Includes all SM 6.7 features like AdvancedTextureOps, WaveOpsIncludeHelperLanes</li>
<li>Caveat: Technically not Vulkan spec compliant implementation, but works fine on at least NV and RADV. Currently implemented as an opt-in option for now in case some game relies on it to work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement CreateSampler2</li>
<li>Expose inverted viewport / height feature</li>
<li>Implement RelaxedFormatCasting feature from Enhanced Barriers</li>
<li>Implement support for adjacency topologies</li>
<li>Support A8_UNORM format properly by using <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance5</code>, allowing A8_UNORM UAVs to work correctly</li>
<li>Handle range checked index buffers correctly with <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance5</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New extension use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VK_EXT_dynamic_rendering_unused_attachments</li>
<li>VK_KHR_maintenance5</li>
<li>VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Batch acceleration structure builds. Massively improves build performance on at least RADV.</li>
<li>Massively improve ExecuteIndirect performance when using COMPUTE + root parameter changes when <code class="inline-code">VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute</code> is enabled.</li>

      <title>Toaplan Arcade Shoot &#39;Em Up Collection Vol.2 definitely delivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a fan of retro games and you love your shoot 'em ups, you should check out Toaplan Arcade Shoot 'Em Up Collection Vol.2.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it's the second in a set of revivals from classic Toaplan games as they work with Bitwave Games to get them on Steam. They all come with various enhancements thanks to emulation along with Linux and Steam Deck support. If you played Volume 1, you will know what to expect as it's more of the same goodness here.</p>
<p>The games included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hellfire: Toaplan's first side-scrolling shooter, known for its blazing graphics and strategic gameplay. Save the galaxy by burning aliens to ashes with the ultimate firepower!</li>
<li>Slap Fight (AKA Alcon): A brain-melting vertical shooter with gauge-based power-ups that'll get your blood pumping!</li>
<li>Fire Shark: Set the skies ablaze and endure white-knuckle shmup action in this no-nonsense aerial trial! Fly solo or play in co-op.</li>
<li>Flying Shark (AKA Sky Shark): A military shmup adventure with destructive power-ups, stunning graphics, and evil enemy forces to destroy!</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes these great, is that they haven't just slapped on a nice menu with an emulated game. They went the full mile to ensure they work well on modern systems with all sorts of enhancements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Experience the game in Mirror Mode.</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra-customizable practice mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to a key to each being sent over by Embracer Freemode, I've been attempting to play them through. Key word here is attempting, because wow — they're certainly difficult. I don't know if my reaction time has just gotten slower, or if game design has just changed a lot but I really struggled with these. They can be quite fast, and the limited space really adds to the challenge. Thankfully, the ability to slow down time at any point (or speed it up) at the touch of a button is a really useful feature.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8806255841694439045gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8806255841694439045gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Pictured - Fire Shark on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Being able to rewind whenever you want is also my absolute favourite feature, and something I made great use of. Every time you think you're doing well, and you're having a good run, there's just that one stray bullet that comes along to annihilate you. However, they do include various accessibility assist options too that you can enable whenever you feel like it including auto fire that you can tweak in "button presses per second", the ability to auto dodge fire and enemies, give yourself health so it's not instant death, make your hitbox smaller and showing your hitbox on-screen.</p>
<p>I've not encountered any issues, they all work beautifully and they feel perfectly at home on Steam Deck too. Performance is perfect, and the controls feel great too. I've no doubt they will get Steam Deck Verified sometime soon because of how great they run. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19574332751694440280gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19574332751694440280gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Pictured - Hellfire on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>While I didn't get quite the nostalgia hit as I did from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-zero-wing-and-other-classics-hit-steam/" target="_blank">Volume 1</a>, which included my favourite Zero Wing, these are all still great shoot 'em ups to pick up. The detail in the artwork in these games is still often unmatched by newer generation shoot 'em ups, they just don't often have the same kind of charm.</p>
<p>The attention to detail to not only bring these games back to life, but to make them more playable and accessible than ever is to be truly commended here. This is how you do it! I hope to see a lot more developers go back through their older games like this, as too many end up getting lost with no easy way to get them so Toaplan and Bitwave are doing some truly great work here for game preservation.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.3 has game fixes for The Sims 2, Tomb Raider Anniversary, Far Cry 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Somehow, I missed that <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.3" target="_blank">DXVK 2.3</a> went out last week. So here's a run over what's new for this Vulkan-based translation layer that converts Direct3D 9/10/11 for Wine and Proton.</p>
<p>One of the headline improvements here is presentation improvements. If you have support for the <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_present_wait</code> extension, and have  vertical synchronization is enabled, you might end up seeing reduced input latency in some games. However, on some platforms and compositors frame latency may be higher than expected.</p>
<p>On top of that if you have the extension <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1</code> supported, turning VSync on / off may no longer need to recreate the Vulkan swap chain working around severe performance issues in some games. Currently that is only supported on Gamescope when <code class="inline-code">ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1</code> is set.</p>
<p>There's also some configuration changes with <code class="inline-code">dxgi.nvapiHack</code> deprecated in favour of <code class="inline-code">dxgi.hideNvidiaGpu</code>, along with similar options for AMD and Intel GPUs that allows them to put in targeted application workarounds for issues. On top of that <code class="inline-code">dxgi.tearFree</code> and <code class="inline-code">d3d9.tearFree</code> were merged into <code class="inline-code">dxvk.tearFree</code>.</p>
<p>Lots more improvements and fixes including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Configuration options can now be specified via an environment variable, <code class="inline-code">DXVK_CONFIG</code>. See the README for details (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3581" target="_blank">#3581</a>).</li>
<li>If <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_depth_bias_control</code> is supported, depth bias scaling will now be correct in most situations. This fixes shadow rendering artifacts in various D3D9 games and is especially important on GPUs that do not support 24-bit depth formats. This affects games such as F.E.A.R. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/1461" target="_blank">#1461</a>), Far Cry 2 (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2941" target="_blank">#2941</a>) and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2642" target="_blank">#2642</a>).</li>
<li>If <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_line_rasterization</code> and its relevant features are supported, smooth or rectangular lines will now be used if requested by the application. This functionality is generally not used by games, but may be useful for applications such as level editors.</li>
<li>If <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance5</code> is supported, <code class="inline-code">DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM</code> images will now use the corresponding Vulkan format.</li>
<li>D3D9 command submission now works the same way as it does for D3D11, which will lead to more submissions but generally reduces resource readback latency. This may improve performance in games that frequently synchronize with the GPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor issue with D3D9 feedback loop tracking.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor issue with D3D11 stream output (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3634" target="_blank">#3634</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug and performance issues with the implementation of D3D11 tiled resources.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues with reporting HDR metadata.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when compiling D3D9 shaders generated by the vkd3d HLSL compiler. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3616" target="_blank">#3616</a>)</li>
<li>Implemented keyed mutex synchronization on top of newly added winevulkan functionality (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3601" target="_blank">#3601</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3635" target="_blank">#3635</a>).<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This will only work with recent Proton builds.</li>
<li>Added stubs for various D3D9On12 interop interfaces. This is needed for <strong>Train Simulator Classic</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3445" target="_blank">#3445</a>).</li>
<li>Added an interface to allow external libraries, such as NVAPI, to enable HDR in various D3D11 games as well as Elden Ring (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3625" target="_blank">#3625</a>).<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This will only work in combination with <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/commit/c3a1c48eebdef1d0f9f030ebd57e2c40625dc542" target="_blank">jp7677/dxvk-nvapi@<tt>c3a1c48</tt></a> or newer. This will <strong>not</strong> work on Windows.</li>
<li><strong>A Total War Saga: TROY</strong>: Fixed trees not rendering when MSAA is enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Far Cry 2:</strong> Fixed crash when using D3D10.</li>
<li><strong>Halo Online</strong>: Fixed water rendering. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3594" target="_blank">#3594</a>, PR: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3627" target="_blank">#3627</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</strong>: Fixed deadlock when using Exclusive Fullscreen (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3458" target="_blank">#3458</a>).</li>
<li><strong>RaceRoom Racing Experience</strong>: Fixed a crash when starting a race. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3386" target="_blank">#3386</a>, PR: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3389" target="_blank">#3389</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Spider Man: Shattered Dimensions</strong>: Fixed a regression that caused blocky shadows. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3593" target="_blank">#3593</a>, PR: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3624" target="_blank">#3624</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Test Drive Unlimited 2</strong>: Fixed shadows on grass. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3469" target="_blank">#3469</a>, PR: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3471" target="_blank">#3471</a>)</li>
<li><strong>The Sims 2</strong>: Fixed a regression in DXVK 2.2 that affected terrain rendering. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3474" target="_blank">#3474</a>, PR: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3476" target="_blank">#3476</a>)</li>

      <title>Deckbuilding RPG &#39;Gordian Quest&#39; gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some more deckbuilding? Gordian Quest looks great and it recently became Steam Deck Verified, with the developer talking about the work involved in it. Nice to see more developers improving their older games like this!</p>
<p>What is it? Gordian Quest is an epic deckbuilding RPG inspired by old-school classics like Ultima and D&amp;D, using modern gaming concepts like roguelite elements and turn-based strategic combat. You will form parties of heroes whom you will have to lead and manage on grueling missions. Help them forge bonds and discover new skills among them. Be fearless and unwavering as you work to unravel the curses laid upon the lands and defeat the ultimate evil at the heart of it all.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NLJ3PsbwGAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d1bdf92f0386597cd7b3d46f6d3c2de.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NLJ3PsbwGAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what they said about Steam Deck support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Challenges in our Journey</p>
<br/>
Adapting a game primarily designed for keyboard and mouse to the Steam Deck was no small feat. The main hurdle? Completely rethinking our controls and UI flow. Ensuring that the game felt intuitive and fluid with a controller was paramount, but we also encountered other technical challenges:<br/>
 
<ul>
<li>Button Mapping: Making sure each action, from navigating the menu to selecting a card, felt natural on a controller.</li>
<li>Visual Feedback: Optimizing the graphics for a smaller screen</li>
<li>Performance Optimization: Tweaking the game's performance to ensure it runs smoothly on the Steam Deck's hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
Yet, each challenge was a learning curve and that's also part of what makes game development such an adventure. We're truly grateful for your continued support, patience, and feedback during this process. It has paved the way for us to explore bringing Gordian Quest to more consoles like the Switch or PS5 in the future, reaching out to even more fans of the genre.<br/>
<br/>
If you're a Steam Deck user, we hope you could try Gordian Quest on your handheld and let us know how it runs!</p>

      <title>PSP emulator PPSSPP adds RetroAchievements support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PPSSPP is a free and open source emulator for the Sony PSP, with release 1.16 out now adding in support for the popular RetroAchievements project.</p>
<p>RetroAchievements, as the name suggests, adds in support for an achievements system much like you might see on Steam or games consoles. Currently 202 games are supported with it but they said that in some cases only one or two regions of a game are supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19249558301694428327gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19249558301694428327gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Soulcalibur PSP</em></p>
<p>Some of what else is new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people on Android 13 devices ended up in a situation where the choose-a-folder dialog during set up didn't work correctly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Multiple input event handling fixes, should help with external joysticks</li>
<li>Perf improvements on lower end devices by disabling ubershaders</li>
<li>Multiple fixes for glitches like flicker in WWE vs Smackdown 2006, shadows in Motorstorm, etc.</li>
<li>Lots of additional performance improvements and fixes</li>
<li>Multiple bugfixes around texture replacement, fixing Tactics Ogre fonts among other things</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also added new IR-based JIT compiler backends, which should have long-term performance benefits in addition to compatibility with more CPU architectures. Plus more work towards reverse engineering "some of the more obscure math instructions of the PSP's VFPU, a custom little SIMD coprocessor".</p>
<p>See the release <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/blog/1-16-release-announcement/" target="_blank">announcement here</a>. The Linux version can be grabbed from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.ppsspp.PPSSPP" target="_blank">Flathub</a> but it's not yet at time of article publishing updated to the 1.16 release.</p>

      <title>DXVK-NVAPI 0.6.4 out now expanding HDR support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK-NVAPI is an alternative NVAPI (NVIDIA API) implementation used with DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for running Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck through Proton.</p>
<p>The latest release went out on September 9th with <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.6.4" target="_blank">version 0.6.4</a>. Here's the full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Update NVAPI headers to R535.</li>
<li>Update NVML headers to R535.</li>
<li>Implement HDR support by forwarding the relevant calls into DXVK. This needs DXVK version <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.3" target="_blank">DXVK 2.3</a> or newer. Note that the same requirements for HDR on DXVK apply to DXVK-NVAPI. Thus HDR is currently not possible on Linux with an NVIDIA GPU, but requires a.o. an AMD GPU, kernel patches, Gamescope and DXVK-NVAPI configured to initialize for other drivers.</li>
<li>Initialize NVAPI when <code class="inline-code">DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI=1</code> is set, regardless of the reported PCI vendor ID. This still needs <code class="inline-code">DXVK_NVAPI_ALLOW_OTHER_DRIVERS=1</code> when not running on the NVIDIA proprietary driver.</li>
<li>Restore logging output on the console which was lost in certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Closer match Windows behavior when reporting CUDA capabilities, this fixes a crash in Call of Duty: Ghosts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting and clarifying here for those confused: the HDR support noted is only for legacy NVAPI, as <a href="https://twitter.com/phys_ballsocket/status/1700533163565441294" target="_blank">mentioned</a> by developer Joshua-Ashton (who works on DXVK and VKD3D-Proton) on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FWIW this is only for games that use the legacy NVAPI for HDR, I implemented the same for the AMDAGS path. Eg. Sekiro, Elden Ring, Armoured Core use this. Modern games should really use the DXGI path which I implemented earlier this year.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Alpha Centauri gets an in-development open source remake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like another classic is getting revived with the power of open source. Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri from 1999 has a remake in progress called GLSMAC. All unofficial, like most open source reimplementations and it's early days for the project but it's showing a lot of promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10104957661694424054gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10104957661694424054gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Their plan is to use the original data files, just like other open source remakes (OpenMW for Morrowind for example), while it's a full rework of the graphics engine, networking and pretty much everything else. So plenty will be a bit different like the random map generation, AI and so on while they try to keep it similar to the original logic they are creating the code from scratch.</p>
<p>According to their roadmap they're at stage v0.2+ so they still have quite some ways to go:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>v0.1: fundamental engine functions, such as: rendering, UI, netcode, sound system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.2: basic map functions, such as: tiles, mapgen, creating/saving/loading games, map rendering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.3: basic multiplayer: ability to host and join games, lobby, save/load games with same players. multiplayer support will be maintained during further steps from now on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.4: game processing, such as: game turns, units (only scout patrols, formers and colony pods), buildings (only recycling tanks), technologies (only centauri ecology), building of bases (only land bases), terraforming (only farms, mines and solar arrays), unit combat, victory by conquest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.5: all remaining SMAC units, buildings, terraformings, technologies, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.6: all remaining victory types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.7: AI (computer opponents, cities automation, units automation, etc) and diplomacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.8: alien lifeforms, ecology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.9: all remaining in-game UI, including game settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.10: non-crucial things like movies, interludes, dynamic music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v0.11: final polishing and bugfixing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to watching this one grow, Alpha Centauri was absolutely one of my favourites. I remember spending so many hours playing it through.</p>
<p>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri can be picked up with the Alien Crossfire expansion <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri" target="_blank">on GOG.com</a>. You can follow the remake <a href="https://github.com/afwbkbc/glsmac" target="_blank">project on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 reimplementation OpenRCT2 gets a new title theme</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team and community behind OpenRCT2, the open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 have a brand new update out which includes some fun changes like a whole new title theme.</p>
<p>For this update they commissioned Allister Brimble, who worked on the original soundtrack, to compose a new official piece for OpenRCT2. To go along with that, the developers held a contest to include a bunch of new parks in the background of the menu to spruce it up a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7497278911694423377gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7497278911694423377gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the main additions in OpenRCT2 0.4.6 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feature: [<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/discussions/15660" target="_blank">#15660</a>] Ability to show window buttons on the left.</li>
<li>Feature: [<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/20680" target="_blank">#20680</a>] New title sequences (<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/title-sequences/releases/tag/v0.4.6" target="_blank">https://github.com/OpenRCT2/title-sequences/releases/tag/v0.4.6</a>).</li>
<li>Feature: [OpenMusic#41] Official Title Theme by Allister Brimble.</li>
<li>Improved: [<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/20119" target="_blank">#20119</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/20243" target="_blank">#20243</a>] Add new colour presets to several roller coasters (using the new colours).</li>
<li>Improved: [<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/20393" target="_blank">#20393</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/20410" target="_blank">#20410</a>] Add Cyrillic characters Ґґ, Ѕѕ, Єє, Іі, Її, and Јј to the sprite font.</li>
<li>Change: [<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/19785" target="_blank">#19785</a>] OpenMusic is now selected by default when opening SC4/SC6 - or creating new - scenarios.</li>
<li>Change: [<a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/20110" target="_blank">#20110</a>] Fix a few RCT1 build height parity discrepancies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus the usual assorted bug fixes. Like the Camera and UI are no longer locked at 40 Hz, providing a smoother experience which is actually quite a big change for it and really should make it feel a lot better. And for those of you who appreciate the screams of your guests, they're no longer cut off on steep diagonal drops.</p>
<p>The developers also mentioned to me over email that "OpenRCT2 had RISC-V port for 6 years now, well before any hardware was available" and that with "real CPUs becoming available, some people have started trying it" which you can see on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V02yYMsVIY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>You need the data files to actually play it. You can buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. See more on the <a href="https://openrct2.org/" target="_blank">OpenRCT2 website</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. Just run it, and then it will ask you to point it to where you installed the original and that's all you need to do! Nice and easy.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get PAYDAY 3 Beta to work on Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAYDAY 3 has a technical Beta currently live, as they're testing out their servers ready for the full release on September 21st. Getting it running on Steam Deck and desktop Linux needs a little fix to work so here's how.</p>
<p>It's quite simple but does require a few steps and just a little patience.</p>
<p>First of all, I would suggest signing up for their <a href="https://nebula.starbreeze.com/" target="_blank">Nebula account</a> system and then doing the Steam account linking. This will then allow the game to just auto log in. This third-party account is necessary right now. </p>
<p>Now, when you try to launch the game you'll be greeted by an error that will look a bit like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5732671451694243437gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5732671451694243437gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully it's easy to get around but here is where you need a little patience, as some parts can take a little while to load. You'll need to install <em>Protontricks</em>, which is available as a Flatpak from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks" target="_blank">Flathub</a> (via Discover on Steam Deck in desktop mode). You <em>may</em> need to give Protontricks permissions to read the drive PAYDAY 3 is installed on, like an SD Card for Steam Deck or a different Steam Library drive on desktop. Run these in terminal:</p>
<p>For Desktop Linux:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --filesystem=/mnt/MySSD/SteamLibrary com.github.Matoking.protontricks</code></p>
<p>Steam Deck SD Cards:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --filesystem=/run/media/mmcblk0p1 com.github.Matoking.protontricks</code></p>
<p>After that, reload Protontricks.</p>
<p>Next you'll need to scroll to select PAYDAY 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16344433851694244059gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16344433851694244059gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then you'll need to go through a few different screens to select the default wineprefix:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6766787161694244060gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6766787161694244060gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Next up is select the top option to install a Windows DLL or component:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5313593341694244060gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5313593341694244060gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then scroll down to find <em>vcrun2019</em> or <em>vcrun2022</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3789849101694244061gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3789849101694244061gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Oddly, vcrun2022 showed up on Steam Deck for me but not desktop Linux but regardless both 2019 and 2022 work.</em></p>
<p>Then you'll see a few installer screens for vcrun like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15765998051694244061gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15765998051694244061gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Just go through these, there's at least two and once finished it will bring back the Protontricks screen and you're then good to go. PAYDAY 3 will now run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13142836351694244465gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13142836351694244465gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>More teasers appear for upcoming Valve hardware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently I wrote about potential new hardware coming from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Valve related to "Galileo" and "Sephiroth"</a> that could be a Steam Deck refresh or new VR kit. Now we have basic initial details on a device being certified in South Korea.</p>
<p><em>We still have no idea what it will be, so this is all pure speculation as usual until Valve actually announce something.</em></p>
<p>This next one comes from Brad Lynch <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1699836012900544823" target="_blank">on X</a>, who found it. The <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202317210000256753" target="_blank">certification</a> (translated) dated August 28th reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific low-power wireless devices (wireless devices for wireless access systems including wireless LAN (5150-5350 MHz, 5470-5850 MHz frequency band))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really much at all to go on, except whatever this is it will have 5GHz WiFi. Many devices have WiFi capabilities including the Steam Deck, so it's still not much.</p>
<p>Doesn't really point either way to it being a Steam Deck refresh or the long leaked Deckard VR headset. However, from patents, we did see previously the Deckard VR kit will have a standalone mode so perhaps this is related to that? On top of that, we've seen Valve begin to improve SteamVR for Linux again recently so I am definitely leaning more into this all being work towards the successor to the Index.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lynch also <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1699901595469918620" target="_blank">noticed</a> that there's actually a Valve Galilieo-specific mirror of Steam OS that's password protected. </p>
<p>Clearly, Valve are up to something. What do you think it will end up being?</p>

      <title>Amnesia: The Dark Descent Redux mod adds Vulkan and DirectX 12 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite fun to see. Amnesia: The Dark Descent has gained a Redux mod that rebuilds the graphics engine behind the game to provide Vulkan on Linux and DirectX 12 on Windows. It's not just adding it for the heck of it though, the developer said it will also correct some graphics issues in the original game while adding in new graphics options like HBAO+.</p>
<p>This is possible because Frictional Games opened up the source code for multiple of their games (<a href="https://github.com/FrictionalGames" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). This particular Redux mod reworks the graphics using <a href="https://theforge.dev/" target="_blank">The Forge</a>, a cross-platform rendering framework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14781223371694176301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14781223371694176301gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Amnesia: The Dark Descent Redux on Kubuntu, credit: me.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect perfection from the Redux mod just yet, as the developer said you can play it through but you may encounter some issues while they continue to improve it.</p>
<p>This is why open source is great. Anyone can come along and improve older games, give them a graphical boost and ensure they keep working long into the future.</p>
<p>Find the mod on <a href="https://mpollind.itch.io/amnesia-the-dark-descent-redux" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OSS-Cosmic/AmnesiaTheDarkDescent" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You need to own a copy of the game to use it.</p>

      <title>Fully-voiced surreal horror visual novel Slay the Princess launches October 20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from the developers of the excellent Scarlet Hollow, their next game Slay the Princess is set to launch on October 20 with full Native Linux support and it looks great. Save the princess? How about no. You're supposed to <em>slay</em> her apparently. Well this is a bit different isn't it.</p>
<p>Facilitate fate in an evolving drama drenched in monochromatic hand-penciled art from Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard (The Crossroads at Midnight, The Last Halloween). Experience déjà vu like never before in a branching meta-narrative that unfolds its story in warped, hilarious, and unpredictable ways. Slay or be slain (or find a third option?) as each loop contorts to reflect each decision, forming a story with new twists and turns each playthrough. Begin the quest anew, joined by new personalities attempting to guide your actions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IY07Vh7MEbg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c6addbaca318b09f6425f3a87d79b55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IY07Vh7MEbg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully voice-acted</strong> by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
<li><strong>Hand-penciled art</strong> - every background and sprite is drawn traditionally with pencil and paper by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</li>
<li><strong>A princess.</strong> She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li><strong>No, the Princess isn't a cosmic horror.</strong> She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li><strong>Don't even think about trying to romance her.</strong> It won't end well for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hopefully you won't die.</strong> But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>Time loops <strong>No time loops.</strong> Don't be ridiculous. Time is a strictly linear concept and it certainly doesn't "loop," whatever that's supposed to mean.</li>
<li><strong>A branching narrative</strong> where what you say and what you believe determines both who you are and how the story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“It starts out simple,” says Tony Howard-Arias, Lead Writer at Black Tabby Games. “And, ultimately, it stays simple — the premise never changes. You’re here to slay the Princess, and you need to slay her to save the entire world. But trust is a fragile thing, and the context around the goal changes dramatically the more decisions you make and the more you develop your relationship with the characters and the world. We’re really excited to see how everyone navigates these surreal gray waters.”</p>
<p>The previous game, Scarlet Hollow, also had full Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. So I expect Slay the Princess will also be Steam Deck Verified at some point since it also has full controller support.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Projekt Z: Beyond Order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Projekt Z: Beyond Order is an upcoming atmospheric first-person zombie co-op shooter set in WW2, in development by 314 Arts and a new trailer is live. They also mentioned late last year they have gained Modus Games as a publishing partner. It was also originally just called Projekt Z with it being renamed to Projekt Z: Beyond Order recently.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see they continued even after their Kickstarter failed.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Projekt Z: Beyond Order is a first-person shooter set in a WW2 Zombie scenario on a secret German island. The game focuses on the threat of 'Projekt Z', a clandestine program run by the Nazis to turn Zombies, which have been discovered on the island earlier, into weapons to help turn the tide of the war in Nazi Germany's favor. On the Island, you will discover various other secret Nazi projects related and unrelated to 'Projekt Z'."</p>
<p>Check out the new teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dn93k37MUwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80b6b56eb04fb9fce741178c2001202c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dn93k37MUwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email, when asking about their plans for full Linux support they gave a resounding "Yes! :)" answer so expect Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>Quite keen to see how this one evolves, especially as it's not another straight-shooter, with elements outside of the exploration and survival with a hideout that you continually build up, which they say will be a little like Fallout 4's settlement building. However, there will also be a full story with multiple arcs to go through.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/763310/Projekt_Z_Beyond_Order/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 to launch in February 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>They've finally set a date! The big release of the KDE Plasma 6 desktop is now set to launch in February 2024.</p>
<p>Confirming the plans in another recent developer overview <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/09/06/september-plasma-6-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, KDE dev Nate Graham mentioned there's no specific day yet but they've at least marked down the month and they are "feeling quite confident that the release will be in excellent shape by then" and another few months should make it solid.</p>
<p>Plasma 6 is now in Stage 4 of their original roadmap that Graham posted earlier in this year that went through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it compile.</li>
<li>Make it livable.</li>
<li>Clean up the code.</li>
<li>Implement planned features and changes.</li>
<li>QA it and fix the bugs.</li>
</ol>
<p>And some of the work done includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom ordering for KRunner search results.</li>
<li>Printers KCM rewritten in QML.</li>
<li>Double-click by default.</li>
<li>Tap-to-click by default.</li>
<li>Icons throughout Plasma itself now exclusively come from the systemwide icon theme.</li>
<li>Support for automatic bug reporting in DrKonqi and improved reporting flow in general.</li>
<li>Autostart KCM shows details about entries.</li>
<li>Distros can now customize the first page in Welcome Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to it. With Plasma being my desktop environment of choice on my Linux desktop (Kubuntu) and it's what's included on Steam Deck with SteamOS too. So hopefully before too long we will see Valve give it an upgrade in SteamOS too.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Infinite from Paradox releases October 12</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive along with Nimble Giant Entertainment have announced that Star Trek: Infinite will be releasing on October 12th. Unlike titles from their in-house first-party development teams, this one will <em>not</em> have Native Linux support. It's built on the foundation of Stellaris, and pretty much looks like Star Trek Stellaris.</p>
<p>Even on the Steam page Paradox touch on this noting that "Star Trek: Infinite is built upon the core systems of Stellaris, leveraging the deep and complex system and making them its own. Aspects of these systems have been streamlined and simplified to better resonate with the Star Trek franchise." — so they're expanding the audience, while making elements of it simpler.</p>
<p>"Beginning decades before the Star Trek: The Next Generation era, Star Trek: Infinite grants players the power to shape the galaxy’s destiny as a faction of their choice. The immersive grand strategy game puts players in the captain’s chair to lead one of four unique Quadrant Powers: The United Federation of Planets, Romulan Star Empire, Cardassian Union, or Klingon Empire. While remaining faithful to Star Trek lore, Star Trek: Infinite introduces fresh avenues for adventure as players can explore the Alpha and Beta quadrants, govern empire dynamics, handle economic intricacies, and engage with undiscovered civilizations."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3gS_nMkKl84"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca93162a0f92eacfadab981bfc63a67c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3gS_nMkKl84" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622900/Star_Trek_Infinite/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for pre-purchase and you get certain rewards if you grab it before release including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Star Trek: </em><em>Lower Decks</em> uniform options</li>
<li>The <em>U</em><em>.</em><em>S</em><em>.</em><em>S</em><em>.</em><em> Cerritos</em>, a science ship with special options for minor nations (Second Contact)</li>
<li>A Klingon advisor voice line, “Qapla”</li>
</ul>
<p>In a preview that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23862814/star-trek-infinite-release-date-strategy-game-paradox" target="_blank">Polygon</a> had, they're keen to note it's not just a Star Trek skin on Stellaris. A quote from producer Mats Holm: "We split off from the <em>Stellaris</em> main branch quite a while ago," says Holm. "The <em>Stellaris</em> team is completely focused on making every possible sci-fi theme that you can imagine, put into one game. On <em>Star Trek: Infinite</em>, we want to make the ultimate Star Trek fantasy. We want it to be very bespoke."</p>
<p>I'm something of a Trekkie myself, so I'm hopeful it's a good one and hopeful it works well with Proton.</p>

      <title>Chaotic furniture-building co-op game KallaX only gives one player instructions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KallaX sounds like it could be quite hilarious. With co-op play of between 2-6 players, you will need to build some furniture but the problem is, only one of you has been given the instructions.</p>
<p>The developers, studio Unexpected, previously worked on games like As Far As The Eye and Antioch: Scarlet Bay and they say this game may very well "destroy your friendships forever". If it's anything as truly chaotic as Overcooked, it's certainly going to test your communication.</p>
<p>The trailer is well-made too and does make it look quite silly and fun:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dt1Ztkh8DSQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5bad2411d3da895a443de4a6bdc70fad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dt1Ztkh8DSQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You'll be building all sorts from an ironing board to a complicated furniture in futuristic space environments. The good news is that if one of your friends annoys you enough you can "throw them out the window and let them drift away into the infinity of space" — lovely. This really does sound like a lot of fun, cute graphics too.</p>
<p>Launching September 18th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818280/KallaX/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with Native Linux support. It also has full controller support, so could be a good one for Steam Deck fans too.</p>

      <title>Tactical turn-based stealth game Spirited Thief releases September 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spirited Thief looks pretty sweet. A tactical turn-based stealth game with a twist, where you take your time to scout ahead and plan your heist as your ghostly friend, then use your knowledge to break in and break out with pricey loot.</p>
<p>More about it: "Another job gone wrong... Elaj - unlucky thief with a few magic tricks upon his sleeves - and Trin - his partner-in-crime who happens to be an intangible spirit - are on the verge of being kicked out of the ruthless Thieves Guild! Determined to prove themselves to the guild, and make some sweet steals in the process, Elaj and Trin must work together to infiltrate heavily protected vaults, mysterious crypts, and more. With the occasional help of allies, what secrets, treasures, and troubles will the pair get their hands on?"</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed that it will launch on September 19th, along with Native Linux support and there's a brand new trailer to show off too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8_e391Dmp0k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01b2c3647a25ae7e23d950bddee35dd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8_e391Dmp0k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steal as Elaj, the thief. Loot as much as you can without giving the guards time to react.</li>
<li>Outsmart enemies, sneak through locked doors, and break down magical barriers. No door can stop you.</li>
<li>With turn-based gameplay, get in and get out before the guards become aware of your presence. You’ve only got so long, so use your turns wisely.</li>
<li>Infiltrate wealthy castles, dark dungeons, and occult lairs under the guidance of the infamous thieves' guild.</li>
<li>Upgrade your skills with new and exciting abilities in exchange for your ill-gotten gains.</li>
<li>Study your briefings so you know what you’re getting into and what to look out for. Will you take it slow and steady to find all the secrets, or is a smash-and-grab more up your street?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Should hopefully be nice on Steam Deck at release as well as desktop Linux, as the developer showed off work previously to make it with nicely with gamepads.</p>

      <title>Titanfall 2 has a player surge with a huge sale, great on Steam Deck &amp; desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available really cheap until September 18th, Titanfall 2 has one of the best FPS campaigns around and some great multiplayer with the <a href="https://northstar.tf/" target="_blank">Northstar</a> mod too. </p>
<p>It's rated Steam Deck Playable and does work just great on desktop Linux. If you want to use Northstar, it may be best to use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/ge-proton-8-14-released-deprecated-workarounds-removed/" target="_blank">latest GE-Proton</a>, as one of the recent updates to GE-Proton added some helpers for Northstar. What exactly is it though? Northstar is a modding framework client that allows users to host their own Titanfall 2 servers using custom scripts and assets to create custom content, as well as being able to host vanilla content. Once again, modding keeping a game alive after the original developer moves on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6520003351694090926gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6520003351694090926gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The Ultimate Edition is currently 90% off making it only £2.49, which is a ridiculously good price for such a great game. So many hours of fun can be had for that.</p>
<p>It turns out I hadn't actually done a Steam Deck video of the game yet, although I did previously do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDdhiC18KrM" target="_blank">footage on desktop Linux</a> back in 2020 where even then it was running exceptionally well. So here's some footage running on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental, followed by a guide to set up Northstar on Steam Deck because this was a good excuse to play some more:</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart gets FSR 2.2 and Ray Tracing for AMD GPUs on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software showing how good PC support is done with Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, with another free upgrade out now. It's good news for Steam Deck and desktop Linux players too.</p>
<p>Really great to see, and once again they're doing improvements for Linux systems showing again you don't need Native Linux build to ensure it's supported and runs well. Support is what we want, to make sure we get what we pay for! This isn't the first time they've improved the game for Linux either, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-update-includes-a-fix-for-linux-gamers/" target="_blank">a previous update</a> fixing up issues for NVIDIA GPUs on Linux.</p>
<p>Here's all that's in patch 1.831.0.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stability improvements for AMD Radeon RX 7000 GPUs.</li>
<li>Improved frame pacing on GPUs with 8GB VRAM or less when hitting certain surfaces with large amounts of bullets.</li>
<li>Updated AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution to version 2.2.</li>
<li>Ray-tracing options are now available on AMD GPUs in Linux.</li>
<li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling can now be used in combination with Intel XeSS.</li>
<li>Added water deforming animation when the player character swims.</li>
<li>Hover Boots acceleration now works correctly at frame rates above 60 FPS.</li>
<li>Phantom Dash animation is no longer affected by the frame rate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Phantom Dash effect to remain visible when toggled off.</li>
<li>Various user interface bugfixes.</li>
<li>Adjusted the launcher to fit on screens with low resolutions or high DPI scaling settings.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note, the current build graphics options text still says it's FSR 2.1 and <em>not</em> FSR 2.2, I've made the developer aware and they <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1699759142510985576" target="_blank">told me</a> they will fix the text in the next update.</p>
<p>Some Steam Deck footage for the news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nYZoxg8RpAU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e430c2f4dabd56ca6298c86ccc922ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nYZoxg8RpAU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking pretty good overall on Steam Deck! Some expected slowdowns and dips when loading between portal worlds, and when the action is ridiculously over the top but the normal gameplay is almost a solid 30FPS. It feels really good on the Steam Deck and looks fantastic on the 7 inch screen.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/ratchet-clank-rift-apart?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895880/Ratchet__Clank_Rift_Apart/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>These custom Steam Deck buttons look awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to mod your Steam Deck to make it a little bit more fancy? Deck Buttons from Colored Controllers look awesome but they're selling out fast.</p>
<p>Made by one person in the USA, these custom resin buttons come in various different colours and styles and can replace your Steam / Quick Settings, Start / Select, the Dpad and ABXY. The colours really do look awesome too and seem like quite a fun way to spice up how your Steam Deck looks from the same creator as the TouchProtect covers for the Steam Deck trackpads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3396050841694090150gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3396050841694090150gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>This does of course mean you would need to open up your Steam Deck but a mod that's nowhere near as intense as changing the entire cover or the screen. Actually changing the buttons over is one of the simpler mods you can do, a good one for a beginner.</p>
<p>And who wouldn't want to use some of these?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17858187591694090222gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17858187591694090222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Available in Party Black and Party Purple, shown above. Plus Holographic (the gif above) and Neon Blue, Neon Pink, Neon Yellow, Red and Atomic Purple.</p>
<p>Stock is selling fast with multiple already sold out but writing on X the creator mentioned they will be "  Ramping up mold making to be able to bring more buttons to you guys." so expect more stock to come once they can get through all the current orders.</p>
<p>Check them out on the <a href="https://deckbuttons.com/" target="_blank">Deck Buttons website</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM Eternal removed Denuvo and it plays great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With all the new amazing games coming out basically every month, lets not forget some slightly older games worth playing. Like DOOM Eternal, that just removed Denuvo Anti-Tamper.</p>
<p>Finally, right? They already removed Denuvo Anti-Cheat back in 2020 but now Denuvo is entirely gone as of the update released September 5th, 2023. So it should work better than ever, although it already did work quite brilliantly before because it was a very optimised game.</p>
<p>Any form of DRM is bad for consumers, so it's nice to see DOOM Eternal set free of the Denuvo curse.</p>
<p>Want to see how it can run on Steam Deck? Here's a quick chatty video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zr17uJaxKxI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71f43424f3a1ac1c8a51ee893d00aedd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zr17uJaxKxI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seriously, the performance on Steam Deck is really impressive. Probably one of the best looking <em>and</em> performing shooters available to play with Proton on Steam Deck by far.</p>
<p>You can buy yourself a copy on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/doom-eternal?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux continues rising above 3% desktop user share on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another month, another set of stats showing that Linux desktop seems to be doing better than ever. According to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide" target="_blank">Statcounter</a>, the Linux share has risen once again. A great sign for the health of the platform with more people using it.</p>
<p>While over on Steam the Linux numbers <em>did</em> dip over the last month, it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-user-share-remains-above-macos-in-the-latest-steam-survey/" target="_blank">still remaining above macOS</a> which is interesting from a gaming standpoint but general desktop use is quite different.</p>
<p>The latest from Statcounter shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li>July - 3.12%</li>
<li><strong>August - 3.18%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Windows share only dropped slightly this month, with the macOS share also dropping. However, ChromeOS, which is also technically a Linux distribution, rose from 3.24% to 3.34%. So if we included that Linux would actually be on around 6.52%.</p>

      <title>DREAMM emulator for classic LucasArts games v2.1 out with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DREAMM is another project focused on keeping classic games alive, designed originally for preserving classic DOS, Windows, and FM-Towns LucasArts games.

<p>Nice to see another crowdfunded title get to a full release, along with the Native Linux support included as well. No Steam Deck rating for the game yet though.</p>

      <title>Steam will soon show better controller support details like for PlayStation controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced to developers that they're going to be rolling out better ways to show off controller support for games on Steam.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3684558162504860651" target="_blank">announcement</a>, they highlighted the additional checks they will be putting in for PlayStation DualShock and DualSense controllers. Giving developers the ability to go through a controller-support questionnaire in Steamworks, to indicate if their games play well with controllers like the DualShock or DualSense.</p>
<p>Valve said that starting in October, they will be rolling out new ways to show this controller support to Steam users. One way may look a bit like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3907467081694007554gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The updates to how Steam will display new controller support will include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updates to store page area that displays controller support to also specify the level of PlayStation controller usage.</li>
<li>Updates to some browse pages to make it easier for players to find new games that support their controller device well.</li>
<li>Updates to the Steam Desktop client to indicate a game in your library has PlayStation controller support.</li>
<li>Updates to the Steam Desktop client to make it more clear when a game requires use of a controller to play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for why Valve are doing this they said that it has become much more common for PC players to use a controller, noting that since 2017 Steam has "seen over 87 Million users play at least once using a controller" and about 67% of them use a form of Xbox controller, with the rest being "PlayStation controllers, Switch Pro Controllers, and hundreds of other devices". However recently they've seen the most growth with PlayStation controllers noting that in 2018 they were only "about 11%" but they now see "27%" use PlayStation controllers.</p>
<p>Clearly using a controller on PC is popular, so it's good to see Valve are helping developers to better advertise what their games support.</p>
<p>With the Steam Deck out, and many other handhelds coming along, hopefully we will also see even more developers actually hook up some proper full controller support with a good UI for it.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor more playable on Steam Deck with Patch 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor just had Patch 7 released, and Respawn noted it includes some performance improvements. So what does this mean for the Steam Deck? Here's what.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux, it worked pretty great overall already. On the Steam Deck though, it was pretty problematic. Even just the intro section failed to hit a solid 20FPS. After Patch 7 though? It's like a night and day difference, I'm very surprised at just how big the difference is often a 10FPS improvements over what it was before. We're looking at a much closer 30FPS experience, which is where we would expect such AAA games to be on a handheld like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's some fresh footage showing the improvement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aiRlVGZGmYg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05757b7eaf96c12c89cbc85b7344b435.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aiRlVGZGmYg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you can see, apart from some blips, we're really looking at a more playable experience there now. Good news for anyone who wanted to take STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor on the go. Some parts <em>will</em> still drop below 30FPS a fair bit, and some cut-scenes still have problems but either way — it is a big improvement over the initial release.</p>
<p>However, like with a few other titles, as mentioned in the video I did still see the RAM spike up to 14GB and crash the Steam Deck completely. It's a really random issue that not everyone sees, but very annoying for those that do. You might be able to get around that with the <a href="https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities" target="_blank">CryoUtilities</a> tool.</p>
<p>Now compare the above footage with how it was <em>originally</em>:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="poYcwyybW8I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4253bc83e5aab08c43e51979a932c87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/poYcwyybW8I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That's quite a difference.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1774580/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Survivor/" target="_blank">STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>In other Steam Deck news, an update to the Linux kernel teased <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Valve 'Galileo' and 'Sephiroth'</a> hardware. Potentially a refreshed Steam Deck, a new VR device or something else (or <em>nothing</em>).</p>

      <title>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars getting remastered, plus a whole new adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revolution Software recently announced two huge bits of news for adventure game fans! Not only will there be a whole new game with Broken Sword - Parzival's Stone but Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged is coming too.</p>
<p><em>Yes I totally missed the original announcements.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Y_s5p_rBIjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdfd93e6d5e39b86bd7d50d401a36bdf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Y_s5p_rBIjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“This is the start of what we’re calling the ‘Broken Sword Renaissance’,” says Charles Cecil, Founder and CEO of Revolution Software. “With both Parzival’s Stone and Shadow of the Templars: Reforged, we’re making a big, bold, and broad offer both to those who have walked in the shoes of George &amp; Nico before and hunger for a new adventure, and also just as crucially people who have never even heard of the franchise. As with all Broken Sword games, both titles exist as independent adventures with no prior knowledge required, though naturally for those invested in the world we’ve created, there’s a lot to tap into under the surface.”</p>
<p>One thing to note, is that Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23842925/broken-sword-6-bs1-remaster-charles-cecil" target="_blank">making use of AI Art</a> to help it along. Speaking to Polygon the founder of Revolution, Charles Cecil, mentioned they simply couldn't afford to remake it without the help of an AI trained using their own sprites. This did result in some backlash, with Cecil <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/broken-sword-designer-charles-cecil-says-criticism-of-bespoke-ai-tool-is-frankly-ludicrous-" target="_blank">speaking to Game Developer</a> to try and clear it up noting they own <em>all</em> the data, it's trained with their own work, and it saves time on tedious tasks to let their artists then add the human touch after for "facial expressions, correct animations, and finesse the details" and so on.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fuss over AI art, especially because plenty of it is trained by using artwork from others, but in this case it simply sounds like a useful time-saving tool for their artists.</p>
<p>Both games are due out next year, and according to the Steam pages for each they will have Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Linux updates tease Valve &#39;Galileo&#39; and &#39;Sephiroth&#39; - Steam Deck refresh? Or new VR?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something that could be exciting but also could be a whole lot of nothing. So keep expectations firmly in check, but work submitted for Linux kernel 6.6 show something interesting from Valve. Potentially a Steam Deck refresh or their new VR headset perhaps?</p>
<p>The note comes from <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-Sound" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, who as usual goes over basically every little thing Linux kernel related. They found work <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87msy8hicb.wl-tiwai@suse.de/" target="_blank">being pulled in</a> for Linux kernel 6.6 sound updates, that includes additions for AMD Van Gogh, the chip used in the Steam Deck. However, when you look into the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git/commit/?id=692f5510159c79bfa312a4e27a15e266232bfb4c" target="_blank">full updates</a> and scroll down for a while there's this interesting little bit:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4266316911693918404gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4266316911693918404gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So here we have <em>Galileo</em> and <em>Sephiroth</em> being added for Valve - the question is <em>what</em> are they? They're being added under "Valve Jupiter device", with Jupiter being one of the names Valve seems to use for SteamOS. Considering the current SoC in the Steam Deck is named Aerith, a refresh of Sephiroth would continue their fun Final Fantasy inspired naming.</p>
<p>They <em>could</em> point to a lot of things: a Steam Deck refresh, the new VR headset we know they're working on, some developer boards they use in-house or anything really. We really have no idea but it's always fun to wonder about what it could turn out to be.</p>

      <title>Half-Life Alyx NoVR mod to get a huge upgrade in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work going into the Half-Life Alyx NoVR mod is quite amazing, and while it was already very playable the next major update coming in October is going to really expand it.</p>
<p>Even in the version available now, you can complete Half-Life: Alyx with it but it's still not quite the best experience. Well, the best experience is obviously with a VR kit but you know what I mean. It's going to get much better for those without.</p>
<p>Here's what to expect in the upcoming update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alyx’s arms and hands fully modelled and animated.</li>
<li>Weapon firing animations for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Weapon idle animations for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Reload &amp; draw animations for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Upgrades for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Visually see each upgrade as you add each one.</li>
<li>Updated HUD.</li>
<li>Bug fixes and other updated game wide.</li>
<li>Multi-tool (maybe…this may not make the cut for this update).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also included a teaser of the animation update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gXIIr3cAq_g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6777537f3e9afd7a82887e258060572.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gXIIr3cAq_g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No exact date other than October for the update but we can expect another update post and another trailer on it to come in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Considering Alyx is one of my all-time favourite gaming experiences, I really can't wait for more people to be able to experience it like this. The mod team really has been putting in some serious effort to make it enjoyable for the masses of people who don't have or can't use VR. </p>
<p>See more on their <a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/half-life-alyx" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a>. Half-Life: Alyx is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Zoom Platform adds Syberia and Syberia II powered by ScummVM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's now easier than ever to play the classic adventures Syberia and Syberia II from Microids, as the Zoom Platform has added them with cross-platform support. For those who don't know, Zoom Platform is a DRM-free store dedicated to keeping classics and modern games alive and they support Linux too.</p>
<p>Now you can grab <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/syberia-1" target="_blank">Syberia</a> and <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/syberia-2" target="_blank">Syberia II</a>, with Linux support, thanks to their team up with <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> to play them with modern game engines. Nice to see another store working to ensure older games are preserved like this, especially since ScummVM do some really impressive work - so why not use it.</p>
<p>About Syberia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kate Walker, a young ambitious lawyer from New York, is handed what seems a fairly straight forward assignment - a quick stopover to handle the sale of an old automaton factory hidden in the alpine valleys, then straight back home to the US. Little did she imagine when embarking on this task that her life would be turned upside down. On her expedition across Europe, traveling from Western Europe to the far reaches of Eastern Russia, she encounters a host of incredible characters and locations in her attempt to track down Hans, the genius inventor - the final key to unlock the mystery of Syberia. Her voyage across land and time throws all she values into question, while the deal she sets out to sign turns into a pact with destiny. </p>

      <title>Game porter Ethan Lee offers services to maintain old games for developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ethan Lee, otherwise known as flibitijibibo (really rolls off the tongue huh), who created <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> and has ported a <a href="https://flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Ports" target="_blank">ton of games</a> to Linux, macOS and more has announced a <a href="https://flibitijibibo.com/maintenance.html" target="_blank">new game maintenance service</a> for developers.</p>
<p>Lee worked on ports like FEZ, Rogue Legacy 2, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, Streets of Rage 4, Celeste, Thirty Flights of Loving and Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap just to name a few.</p>
<p>Now though, Lee is offering up a service to game developers to keep their games updated and working great on modern systems. As said in the announcement: "I am now available for hire to maintain games that have released and may no longer be in development! I believe that I can help bring your back catalog back to life, and can do so quickly and effectively with minimal costs to your business."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The platforms for maintenance and porting include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Xbox (One, Series X|S)</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>macOS (currently x86_64 only, not Apple Silicon)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what Lee has focused on recently includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Verified certification</li>
<li>Migrating from UWP to GDK</li>
<li>Migrating XNA titles to FNA (so yes, your old XBLIG game qualifies!)</li>
<li>Public source code releases (<em>not</em> a requirement though)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one extra little catch though, Lee said that the only requirement (apart from obviously being paid) is that there "must be a native Linux version available to customers" and if developers don't have one Lee will make one for them.</p>
<p>Sounds like a nice service for game preservation. No doubt many developers are over-worked, with plenty of indie teams having a growing list of titles they no longer worked on directly that could benefit from a little TLC. This service offers a full free assessment.</p>

      <title>Valve goes for the smurfs banning 90,000 people in Dota 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the rather exciting launch of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/new-update-for-dota-2-might-pull-me-back-in-with-new-reporting-and-matchmaking/" target="_blank">the Summer Update</a> bringing with it new matchmaking and tools to get rid of bad experiences, Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/570/view/3692442542242977036" target="_blank">goes for the smurfs</a> next.</p>
<p>What are smurfs? They're alternate accounts people use to go into a rank of matchmaking they shouldn't be in, to cause problems, to cheat, to grief other players and generally be toxic. They easily ruin games and so Valve pulled out the great bin ban-hammer and got rid of 90,000 of them this month.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16426574721693911554gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve said they also traced all the smurf accounts to the main account of each player. Going forward, Valve say, a person's main account found to be matched with a smurf could result in "a wide range of punishments, from temporary adjustments to behavior scores to permanent account bans".</p>
<p>Hopefully this threat will make more people think twice before going into an alternate account to screw up matches for others. Cheating and smurfing is a constant problem in online games, so it's good to see Valve put in serious effort to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Have you been playing Dota 2 since the Summer Update? Let me know how you've been getting on in the comments.</p>
<p>Additionally, an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/570/view/3675554676965379462" target="_blank">update</a> to Dota 2 released recently should solve these problems for Linux players:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some over-bright rendering in Vulkan when color-correction post-processing was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the Vulkan renderer on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux GPUs with low memory.</li>
<li>Fixed fullscreen flickering on multi-monitor Linux systems.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 32: Two Steps Forward, One Step Back</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-31-the-fear-of-loss/" target="_blank">Part 31: The Fear of Loss</a></strong></p>
<p>Over the past few months I have been making a number of upgrades and changes to Dianoga, and the time has come to lay them all out. The first upgrade I purchased at the start of the year was a simple one, and is one I have already made an allusion to in passing. German peripheral manufacturer Perixx still makes optical mice sporting a PS/2 connector, letting me experience the best of both worlds with their PERIMICE-209 WP model.</p>
<p>A cranky old ball mouse would indeed be more period accurate, but there are still some limits to what I am willing to go through for the sake of nostalgia. The only problem I encountered was not having the scroll wheel work on Linux, but this was resolved by using the mouseconfig utility and identifying the mouse as an MS Intellimouse, which is actually suggested in the official Red Hat Linux 7.3 documentation. Besides, my next upgrade would bring Dianoga more in line with the late 1990s.</p>
<p>While perusing the wares at the Barrhead Thrift Shoppe on 46th Street my brother found an AcerView 34T UVGA 13" CRT monitor selling for just $2 Canadian Dollars, allowing me to retire the LEN L151p LCD I had been using. As well as not being in keeping with the aesthetic, the LCD also had the annoying habit of showing a warning about being out of range on top of what otherwise looked to be a workable display, especially when playing games that utilized SVGAlib for graphics.</p>
<p>I could get around this by launching certain more pliant SVGAlib games such as the final build of <em>LinCity</em> before starting up the offending applications, as for whatever reason this would seem to soothe the nerves of the display, but I was more than happy to leave those headaches behind. Things were not all clear sailing with the AcerView CRT, however; Windows 98 would always default to shifting the image to the far right, beyond the bounds of the screen.</p>
<p>Compensating for this in the ATI control panel helped somewhat, but it was never perfect, and would not stay persistent upon changing screen resolutions. Linux under XFree86 also showed similar problems, but by using the xvidtune application I was able to produce workable modelines I could then add to my XF86Config-4 file to keep them preserved. I resolved that fiddling with the sizing knobs was just part of the experience, but a solution would come after something else went wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7528814021693852457gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7528814021693852457gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2290804621693852458gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2290804621693852458gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>It was then that the inevitable happened, and the Fujitsu 10.25 GB IDE hard drive the computer came with started to show disk failures in ScanDisk. While the Hitachi 6.01 GB 9.5MM PATA hard drive I had installed Red Hat Linux 7.3 on was still working, albiet with a few quirks of its own, it was becoming clear that I was reaching the end of the road with my older platter media, and would need to go with either an SD or Compact Flash solution instead.</p>
<p>I already had in my possession a Syba 2.5" IDE to Dual Compact Flash Drive intended for use in laptops, and since I already had a PATA to IDE converter in place for the Hitachi, this proved to be no barrier to using it in Dianoga. I also had a set of two cheap Onefavor 8 GB compact flash cards on hand. Before installing Windows 98 I found I had to first format the card as fat32 with the LBA file system flag set, but it otherwise installed fine, and actually sorted my issues with the CRT display.</p>
<p>When moving on to installing Red Hat Linux 7.3 I would get a warning about the partition table being inconsistent if I had more than one compact flash card installed. The simplest solution was just to pull the other compact flash card for the install, which at least gives the benefit of ensuring Windows 98 would be unharmed while partitioning. While the performance was acceptable under Windows 98, the slow read speeds of the Onefavor card would cause the system to stall at times under Linux.</p>
<p>My QDI Advance 5/133 motherboard places a strict limit on the size of hard drive I can use, but I figured I would chance buying another cheap Cloudisk 16 GB 133x compact flash card in the hopes that I could at least make it work by flashing a later BIOS. This proved to be a mistake, but not because of the BIOS, which actually had no complaints. Red Hat Linux 7.3 literally took all night to install, and was crawling worse than it had with the Onefavor card, giving me a rude awakening.</p>
<p>In this case the problem was really on me, as the read and write speeds are displayed on the Cloudisk card label, showing off my lack of due diligence. In the end I bit the bullet and bought a more expensive but far faster Transcend 16 GB compact flash card running at 1066x speeds, which brought down the install time in Anaconda to just shy of half an hour. I now had more than doubled the amount of hard drive space Linux had available, and could enjoy more games with my CRT monitor.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that <strong>Starfield</strong> will be appearing near-top of the list for September 2023, which Valve will give out early next month. Even though <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/heres-how-starfield-runs-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">Starfield doesn't run particularly well on Steam Deck</a>, plenty of people will be brute-forcing their way through it without a doubt.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 535.43.09 and stable 535.104.05 drivers out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA recently released two fresh driver upgrades for Linux, although one of them we have no idea what they actually changed. Here's what's up.</p>
<p>Firstly, NVIDIA launched the stable driver update <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/210649/en-uk/" target="_blank">535.104.05</a> on August 22nd. However, for the second time recently, they seem to have copy-pasted the driver changelog from the previous release. This driver has the <em>same</em> changelog as 535.98, and when 535.98 released it had the same changelog as 535.86.05 but they later corrected it. I tried to contact NVIDIA this time but here we are nearly two weeks later and they haven't fixed it. So what did they change in 535.104.05? No idea.</p>
<p>On September 2nd they also released a fresh <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta</a> Driver 535.43.09 for developers with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_descriptor_pool_overallocation.html" target="_blank">VK_NV_descriptor_pool_overallocation</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes for <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute.html" target="_blank">VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute</a></li>
<li>Correctly clear fragment shading rate attachments with LOAD_OP_CLEAR</li>
<li>Fix potential device lost with vkCmdBlitImage when fragment shading rate is used</li>
<li>Correctly restore pipeline static state if previously overwritten by dynamic state set calls and pipeline is rebound</li>
<li>Fix dual-source blending when output is written to an array variable</li>
<li>Fix VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix bug with variable pointer shared memory CTS tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s how Starfield runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to know how <strong>Starfield</strong> runs on Steam Deck? Or desktop Linux? Well, I've given it a run to see what I think of it and here's some early info for you.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, Valve released <em>two</em> Steam Deck OS upgrades to solve some issues, so you'll want to make sure you check for system updates first to get Steam Deck OS 3.4.10 to fix a GPU driver crash and a black screen problem. Once you update, Starfield <em>will</em> run on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental but the performance <em>is</em> an issue. Additionally, weirdly, the Start / Select buttons on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental are swapped - but you can change them over in Steam Input (noted in video 2 below).</p>
<p>On the lowest possible details with FSR set ON, some sections are fine but when things heat up, and just being in certain areas, the performance will repeatedly drop hard below 30FPS. So right now, it's far less than <em>properly</em> playable.</p>
<p>Here's two Steam Deck videos of the early game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zPVzHbNwnN4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0d272858c248912c2871b81a836f894.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zPVzHbNwnN4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The next video showcases the performance issues you can see quite well, in the city of New Atlantis:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JznnRzCjGKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8352bad67f62c60ac66652060a6b1ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JznnRzCjGKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If Bethesda manage to do some performance patches, where we can get it to a stable 30FPS then it would be pretty great because the gameplay would hold up quite well on Steam Deck at a static 30. Or perhaps Valve have some boosts waiting in Proton and SteamOS upgrades to come, we can hope anyway. This screenshot sums up the experience when running around a city on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6113035261693828313gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6113035261693828313gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's already a number of performance mods out there, including one noted to be for Steam Deck, but in my own testing they don't work particularly well on Steam Deck and one in particular doing the rounds really breaks the lighting.</p>
<p>As for desktop Linux the situation is a little more complicated. As per what the developer of VKD3D-Proton (the Direct3D to Vulkan translation in Proton) <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/1678#issuecomment-1702489043" target="_blank">posted</a> on GitHub there's big issues for NVIDIA and slightly less so for AMD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NV 535 stable is clearly bugged here. 525.47.35 at least seems to work though ...</p>
<p>Performance on NV currently is known to be extremely poor due to being completely CPU bound. This is caused by lack of us enabling NV_device_generated_compute on NV due to a driver bug. <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/1639" target="_blank">#1639</a> for details. When the beta driver updates, it should start running much better.</p>
<p>On Mesa desktop, please ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're running kernels 5.15.121+, 6.1.40+ or 6.4.5+ to fix a kernel regression that affected Starfield. Without it, GPU will hang randomly.</li>
<li>You're running mesa from git to get VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute for optimal performance.</li>
<li>Proton Experimental</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been unable to use Mesa-git on Kubuntu in my testing, because the current build from <a href="https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers" target="_blank">Oibaf</a> seems to break Vulkan. So sticking with Kisak's <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kisak/+archive/ubuntu/kisak-mesa" target="_blank">fresh Mesa PPA</a> for 23.1.6 here's how it ran for me:</p>

      <title>Linux user share remains above macOS in the latest Steam Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the rather exciting development <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-overtakes-macos-users-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">in the last</a> Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey where Linux users overtook macOS for the first time, the latest survey shows Linux continues to be above macOS but with the numbers dipping down.</p>
<p>The latest results for August 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.61% + 0.40%</li>
<li>Linux 1.82% - 0.14%</li>
<li>OSX 1.57% - 0.27%</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7568046251693676435gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7568046251693676435gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When switching over to the Linux-only data here’s the most popular distributions for gaming on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 44.18% +2.11%</li>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 7.68% -0.26%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.03% +0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.10% -3.28%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.99% -0.30%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 3.41% +3.41%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.93% -0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 2.91% +2.91%</li>
<li>Other 24.78% -0.74%</li>
</ul>
<p>So we continue to see that the Steam Deck with SteamOS is what's really pushing Linux gaming right now with it growing again this month compared to other distributions.</p>
