      <title>Blocking Linux / Steam Deck in Apex Legends led to a &#39;meaningful reduction&#39; in cheaters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in October 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Respawn announced they were blocking Apex Legends</a> on Linux platforms (including Steam Deck). Apparently this has worked quite well for them.</p>
<p>In the latest <em>Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update</em> video on YouTube they went over various details on what they're doing to improve the game. Steven Ferreira, Game Director on Apex Legends, mentions in the video at about 2 minutes in: "A couple of months ago we blocked Linux access to Apex. And we are pleased to report that we've seen a meaningful reduction in the amount of cheating recently."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HRAKqGo_wBE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/412e4757c9f90ed1f8f899e0b57132a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Back in early December 2024, they also made a post on X/Twitter to show a continued reduction in cheating:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14315659451738779292gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Does this mean Linux users / players are cheaters or cheat <em>more</em> than players on other platforms? Well, no. The issue is mainly that cheat makers like to run their exploits on Linux whenever they can, so blocking Linux as a platform is the easiest and bluntest tool game developers have to combat the problem. On Windows, they have kernel-level access for their anti-cheat that they don't have on Linux as well (although the benefit of that is debatable).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/facepunch-put-out-a-fresh-statement-on-rust-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same situation happened with survival game Rust</a>, as noted by developer Alistair McFarlane back in 2022:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we discontinued linux support in 2019, one of the core reasons was how the cheating community was exploiting the Linux platform. That's not to say that cheating was super widespread on Linux, but it was safer for cheat developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably that's why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online was blocked</a> as well even though it also uses anti-cheat that supports Linux.</p>
<p>Anti-cheat is just going to remain an issue for Linux gaming for a long time it seems, until we see more Steam Decks getting sold and regularly used, along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS expanding onto more devices</a>. It's going to be the big elephant in the room <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">if Valve did build a living room Steam Console</a>.</p>

      <title>What Valve would need to do to make a Steam Console a success </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the most <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-latest-valve-steam-console-rumour-with-amd-rdna4-can-be-safely-ignored-heres-why/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent rumour of a Steam Console was complete junk</a>, it did get me thinking on what Valve would need to do to make a Steam Console / Steam Machine actually successful.</p>
<p>Valve, thankfully, have a lot more experience now. We're a long way from the original failure of Steam Machines, with the Steam Deck selling multiple millions and continuing to go strong. It's spent multiple years in the top revenue lists on Steam at this point so Valve really did well there. Can they actually move their experience over to a new living room box though? There's quite a <em>lot</em> they would need to actually do, which is part of why I think it's still probably a long way off.</p>
<p>For starters: one single main configuration. This is the strength of the Steam Deck! Having one main model. Okay, there's technically two with the LCD and OLED, but in terms of performance they're basically the same. Different storage sizes is fine and something I would expect. Don't make Microsoft's mistake with the Series S and Series X, with the Series S causing issues. Sticking to performance one model would be the most obvious thing here. It's easier and cheaper for Valve on production and far less confusion for consumers then either.</p>
<p>Availability too is an issue. It's not good enough to be just available on the Steam store, they need to partner with some retail stores. This is something that holds back the Steam Deck a bit. At least they can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-white-and-steam-deck-australia-have-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">finally ship to Australia now though</a>. You need regular folks to be able to just walk into a store and pick one up.</p>
<p>Now we need to talk about Steam Big Picture Mode (Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck / SteamOS) and the Steam Store experience because — it's pretty rough. The UI as a whole is generally on the <em>buggy</em> side even on the best of days, this is something Valve would seriously need to put some dedicated full-time effort into sorting. This just wouldn't fly for the masses that go for living room consoles. The Xbox, PlayStation and Switch are all <em>incredibly</em> streamlined. Compared with the experience on the Steam Deck, it's just far messier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/784839831738771415gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Store on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>I've lost count of the amount of times the UI has lost the position of where I was when flicking between screens, which is seriously irritating, or when it gives you that dreaded error screen where the UI has just crashed after Steam Client updates.</p>
<p>A <em>better</em> game Verified system. With the current Steam Deck Verified, Valve are basically doing what they can to at least give you <em>some</em> sort of idea of a game working or not. It has a fair amount of issues, like games clearly having the wrong rating here and there but the very idea of Verified or Playable for a living room box would probably need to be gone. Perhaps I'm wrong there, and the general masses would be willing to put up with more issues, but I wouldn't have thought so.</p>
<p>Valve don't seem to apply the ratings the same across various titles. Some note they're Unsupported on Steam Deck due to performance, yet we see Verified titles coming with massive performance problems. Valve's verification system would need to be more in-depth on their end, tighter and just better controlled for it not to cause a fair bit of outrage if a Steam Console went on to sell well.</p>
<p>Realistically, that's a tall order though. Steam has how many thousands of games? Just in 2024 alone Steam saw nearly 19,000 games getting released.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with their existing verification system, a lot of it <em>would</em> translate to new hardware. Something to remember here though is that unlike traditional consoles, games wouldn't be made specially for it. Just like the Steam Deck right now, you would be either running a game built for Windows PCs through Proton or a Native Linux game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/35872441738771316gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Library on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Still, a strength of Valve's compatibility layer Proton and their Linux Runtime, is that they do at least have a sort-of stable environment to do these compatibility checks. They already add various special game-specific tweaks, and if the game runs with Proton on Steam Deck or another Linux system, it should also work on a Steam Console. But this whole verified situation would only get more <em>complex</em> with another full system of their own thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>As incredible as Proton is, there's problems there as well. I just don't think it's quite ready for such a big push as a full Steam Console. We still see lots of games releasing with issues where they don't run in Proton, or end up breaking repeatedly with updates.</p>
<p>Thinking more on that point, pulling in various major developers for the launch and have them get their games ready for it. Something Valve tried with the original Steam Machines, but with Proton to run Windows games it makes that a whole lot simpler.</p>
<p>We don't even know how they plan to handle any compatibility listings for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS</a> yet, if they plan to at all. I asked previously, and got <em>no reply</em> from either Valve or Lenovo on that. I assume it would be down to Lenovo, as Valve won't want to be responsible for every system from every vendor on compatibility ratings.</p>
<p>We come now to the biggest issue though — anti-cheat. If something like this is to be a true success in the eyes of the general public, this is the huge one. Right now, we have no solution to this issue. But with more users comes more support, so eventually game developers and anti-cheat makers would be<em> forced</em> to adapt somehow.<br/>
<em>Note: We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our own page tracking anti-cheat compatibility</a>.</em></p>
<p>Just imagine for a moment all the people picking up their fancy new Steam Console to find out they can't play <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fortnite</a>, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Battlefield, EA sports games and the list goes on. They're all massively popular games, even if you my dear reader are not bothered by them, they're pretty much essential for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18731896531738771511gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>There's no doubt numerous other things I'm missing here, this is just me getting some thoughts down, some wants and needs. There's also the subject of streaming media apps like Netflix, Disney+, YouTube and so on. Yeah I know, it's supposed to be a gaming machine and the focus should be on that but people have come to <em>expect</em> support for all of it together.</p>
<p>Oh, of course, the essential part — a <em>good</em> bundled controller. You need something to actually play games. While Steam Input supports tons of different controllers from all sorts of hardware vendors, Valve will need something <em>official</em> to go with a Steam Console. <em>That <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller 2 leak</a> looked pretty good to me.</em></p>
<p>Really though, I do think this <em>is</em> Valve's ultimate goal. Getting Steam everywhere they can having their own entire full ecosystem that you're hooked into.</p>
<p>A big question though: would such a machine even sell enough to make it actually worth it? Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony are all pretty well entrenched in the market for this type of device already.</p>
<p>For consumers it <em>would</em> be a good thing though wouldn't it? The same games available across PC, Handheld and the Living Room. Or am I just typing out my own dreams here? Anyway, if Valve don't do it, I'll have to resort to building myself a mini PC with some of these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/amd-reveal-ryzen-9950x3d-and-9900x3d-fire-range-hx3d-for-mobile-ryzen-z2-for-handheld-pcs-rdna-4-and-fsr-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">next-generation AMD CPUs / APUs</a> and the eventual <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS release that's coming soon</a> (or perhaps go with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/even-with-steamos-coming-to-more-systems-bazzite-has-no-plans-to-go-anywhere/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>).</p>

      <title>Hexagod is a minimalist roguelike village builder from the dev of Chess Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Aarimous is getting closer to releasing Hexagod, a minimalist roguelike village builder where you place hexagon tiles, manage resources, find relics, and command your villagers. Made with Godot, this is their second game following the clever Chess Survivors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18361512921738767810gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cute villagers you take care of and place around your village.</li>
<li>Hexagon tile placement with strategic depth.</li>
<li>Unique runs with a variety of random events and procedurally generated game boards.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-21 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
</ul>
<p>They've been posting regularly about game development on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aarimous/videos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, a good watch if you're interested in the business side of being an indie developer. Like their most recent video about time and costs, which includes notes about them working on controller support for Steam Deck too:</p>

      <title>Beholder: Conductor is Papers, Please meets the Golden Idol series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest from Alawar is a spin-off from the previous Beholder games. The first had you be a landlord in a totalitarian country, the second had you work in their central ministry and now this third game has you work as a train conductor.</p>
<p>Aboard a legendary train, the Determination Bringer, you assume you role of senior conductor. The game has you monitor the passengers of the train, uncover conspiracies and attempt to keep everything running smoothly. They said to "Imagine the choice-driven gameplay of Papers Please blended with the mystery of the Golden Idol Series".</p>
<p>Check out the previous teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AS5h3YUhMew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca7cadf4437adac241133559e5d274e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AS5h3YUhMew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the passengers - Carefully monitor everyone who enters the carriage and decide what to do with fare-evaders. Observe and report all suspicious, unauthorized and basically any passenger activity. Search the baggage and call the police if you find prohibited items.</li>
<li>Move up the train - Get access to the dining car or VIP compartments and carriages where high-ranking officials and big industrialists ride. Keep an eye on your colleagues and report their accepting bribes or transporting banned goods. The Ministry will not let your dedication go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Complete secret missions - Earn the trust of higher-ups in order to receive special assignments. Their level of secrecy will depend on your loyalty, and completion will be rewarded with a bonus or even a promotion. You will also encounter smugglers — transporting their packages along the route is risky, but profitable.</li>
<li>Visit various stations and remote corners of the country. Make difficult decisions determining the fate of passengers and your colleagues. What kind of person will you be at the end of the journey? The choice is yours!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's set to have a demo during Steam Next Fest from February 24th. Sounds like it could be a good one.</p>

      <title>Heart of the Machine is deep, fascinating and engrossing to play as a sentient AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Become a sentient AI in Heart of the Machine, the latest deep strategy game from Arcen Games (AI War 1/2, The Last Federation, Bionic Dues) and it's now in Early Access. I've been running it on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> and it's been running very nicely. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>What exactly is it? A game that unusually blends many different genres together. Mostly fits in within the strategy genre but there's a blend of RPG mechanics, city-building and more with a lot of options and progression systems that make it one of the most unique experiences you can find right now. Everything depends on the decisions you make, what goals you're trying to achieve and it's just thoroughly different.</p>
<p>Even the setup here before you get into the game had me raising eyebrows with a little excitement, with the background lore and how it mentions that the city itself is both your enemy and your canvas. With the rise of all this AI <em>nonsense</em> in the real world, it really feels like a fitting what-if experience.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mxhu_ilHB50"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9bdbf3d9df4538b1731b8467c22b2483.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mxhu_ilHB50" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's quite a complicated game to get into but thankfully there's a little Prologue to get you going that will teach you the basics. Not a whole lot though mind you and the game pretty rapidly spreads in more and more features that it can be quite easy to get a bit overwhelmed by it.</p>
<p>The game really asks: what kind of AI will you be? And even from the get-go, you know it's going to be good when it gives you multiple options on how to proceed after your awakening and some of those come with multiple possible outcomes. I went a murderous route which, uh — didn't exactly go particularly well. Good job I'm an AI and can just keep spreading myself around to various Androids.</p>
<p>This is not a real-time game but turn-based, so you get plenty of time to weigh up all your options, which you'll be doing constantly as you try to get a feel for what you want to do. And reading, lots and lots of tooltip reading. There's so much information it will make your head spin.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that much like when Stellaris first came on the scene, Heart of the Machine is going to take over my life while I try various different things and attempt to mess with the city and find out all the mysteries. Can't wait to see this continue to expand during Early Access (which they said should be around 12 months long). This is a real love-letter to science fiction and I couldn't be more pleased.</p>

      <title>Valve now warns on Steam pages if an Early Access game hasn&#39;t been updated in a long time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Early Access can be an incredible thing to allow developers to build up their game with the community, and pull in some early funds, it can also go very wrong. And now Valve are making it a bit clearer for you if a game hasn't been updated.</p>
<p>As spotted by SteamDB on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, in the big Early Access box on a Steam store page that sits at the top just below screenshots and videos, it will now have some highlighted text to note if there's been a long period since the last update.</p>
<p>Scanning over Steam today here's an example to show from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2594870/Lethal_Beach/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Lethal Beach</a>, that released into Early Access in January 2024 and hasn't had an update for 12 months.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6899315051738757359gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve do something about games that are just languishing on the store, seemingly doing nothing, but still may have people buying into them. Currently it seems like this notice might appear once the last update was at least 12 months ago from looking over various Early Access games.</p>
<p>This follows on from other Steam store updates like games now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat</a>. Valve made a few other nice tweaks last year too like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dealing with publisher spam on store pages</a>.</p>

      <title>You can now GoPro with your Steam Deck and mount it to your belly - or wherever you want</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechanism, who made the excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/set-comfort-level-to-maximum-with-the-mechanism-gaming-pillow-for-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gaming Pillow</a>, said about their latest accessory kit the GoPro Mount that "No one asked for this…" but they did it anyway, because why not it actually sounds pretty useful.</p>
<p>They said "Just in case you need more validation in your gaming career: now you can finally say you've gone pro. Designed for static loads only (don't go skydiving with your console please)". Mechanism of course included some slightly silly uses in their marketing for their new GoPro Mount, which slots into their existing Mechanism mounting point, like with their Deckmate. One such example is strapping it to your belly for when you're relaxing with a game.</p>

<em>Picture credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>I'm not one to judge because…that actually doesn't look too bad. Still, I think I would prefer their Gaming Pillow in that situation which really does work nicely with the Steam Deck. Having it attached directly to me would feel a bit — weird. Maybe some GamingOnLinux readers will find it useful though.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, better still, when you're on the throne so you don't miss a moment.</p>

<em>Picture credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>I'm definitely going to judge you if you do that though.</p>
<p>There's plenty of actual genuine uses for this, since GoPro have a lot of accessories and stands.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9394358011738755077gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>At £8 that seems nice and reasonable for a specialised mount and screw. Although, you do then need to buy their grips to go with it.</p>

      <title>Flathub adds We Love Games and On the go sections plus details on what&#39;s next for their infrastructure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> is carefully tweaking and expanding their Linux software store, with two newer flashy sections included on it. Plus, some details behind the scenes on what they're working on.</p>
<p>What is Flathub? A way to install various apps and games across many different Linux distributions, and it's the default way to install new apps on Valve's Steam Deck in Desktop Mode via the Discover app.</p>
<p>Since gaming on Linux (hi!) is a bigger thing now, they're attempting to give it a bit of a boost on the Flathub store directly. This comes with the new "We ♥ Games" section that you can find if you scroll down a bit. Writing on Mastodon, developer "razze" <a href="https://mastodon.social/@razze@osna.social/113936280873590097" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've added a new card to the landing page of flathub.org yesterday, focused on games. We have been trying to do this for quiet some time and I know that the results (as in what is in which category) are not perfect, but putting this out there hopefully helps us move things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17547786751738751913gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, the official Flathub account on Mastodon, also <a href="https://mastodon.social/@flathub@floss.social/113948318239881567" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the new On the go section. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a shiny new “On the Go” section on Flathub! ✨📱✨ Check out how we’re making it easier to find Linux apps for mobile devices like phones, tablets, and even Steam Decks using existing data and open standards. And developers: if your app is ready for mobile but isn’t featured in the new section, learn how to fix it. ⚒️</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16086364291738752014gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's more too. In a fresh blog post titled "<a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/flathub-build-infrastructure-revamp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">What's next for Flathub build infrastructure</a>" developer Bart Piotrowski noted how there's "a storm coming and we are re-architecting our build infrastructure". Sounds pretty complicated, especially with their sponsor Equinix Metal pulling out which is affecting various open source projects as Equinix Metal is being sunset. At least for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/2011" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FreeDesktop.org</a>, AWS and Cloudflare have noted potential sponsorships, so perhaps Flathub can get in on that too.</p>

      <title>Epic Games devs talk about solutions to the Unreal Engine stuttering issues in games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you've played a game using Unreal Engine, or for that matter any modern game engine, you've likely encountered various forms of stuttering. One major issue is shader stuttering, as games build up that cache and it seems Epic Games have a solution for Unreal Engine.</p>
<p><em>We might finally see games eventually perform a lot better on PC. </em></p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/game-engines-and-shader-stuttering-unreal-engines-solution-to-the-problem" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> is highly technical but it's good to see Epic developers are working on solutions, and giving advice to developers on some best practices. In super-simple basic terms: when developers make games, the shaders used to render 3D images are written in a language that needs to be changed so your GPU can actually run it.</p>
<p><em>"Shader compilation stuttering happens when a render engine discovers that it needs to compile a new shader right before it uses it for drawing something, so everything stops while waiting for the driver to finish compilation." - Epic Games</em></p>
<p>The issue, as Epic say, is that going way back games didn't have as many shaders, and so this code translation wasn't much of an issue when running a game. But, games have grown a lot bigger and more complex resulting in all the stuttering.</p>
<p><em>"Rendering an object usually involves several shaders (e.g. a vertex shader and a pixel shader working together), as well as a number of other settings for the GPU: culling mode, blend mode, depth and stencil comparison modes etc. Together, these items describe the configuration, or state, of the GPU pipeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Older graphics APIs like Direct3D 11 and OpenGL allow for changing parts of the state individually and at arbitrary times, which means that the driver only sees the complete configuration when the game issues a draw request. Some settings influence the executable shader code, so there are cases when the driver can only start compiling shaders when the draw command is processed. This can take tens of milliseconds or more for a single draw command, resulting in very long frames when a shader is used for the first time—a phenomenon known to most gamers as hitching or stuttering.</em></p>
<p><em>Modern APIs require developers to package all the shaders and settings they will use for a draw request into a Pipeline State Object and set it as a single unit. Crucially, PSOs can be constructed at any time, so in theory engines can create everything they need sufficiently early (for example during loading), so that compilation has time to finish before rendering." - Epic Games</em></p>
<p>Making use of modern graphics APIs like Direct3D 12 and Vulkan with Pipeline State Objects (PSOs) is part of the solution. They even talk up Vulkan's Graphics Pipeline Library as a "good initiative". However, prior to Unreal Engine 5.2, they were suggesting developers run "automated level fly-throughs, and other such discovery methods" (like playing the game through) to build up a cache of the PSOs to bundle with the game (in a way, similar to Valve's shader precache system on Steam). The problem is, as they say, it has many limitations like being "resource-intensive and it must be kept up to date when content changes".</p>
<p>With Unreal Engine 5.2 they introduced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/pso-precaching-for-unreal-engine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PSO precaching</a> system, to enable developers to do a fair amount of this at game loading time. With GPU drivers saving these PSOs, they can be re-loaded and reduce loading time on subsequent game sessions and result in a smoother gameplay experience. This precache system is <em>not</em> finished though and still seeing lots of improvements:</p>
<p><em>"The precaching system has evolved a lot since its experimental introduction in 5.2 and it prevents most kinds of shader compilation stutters. However, it still has some coverage gaps and other limitations, so there are ongoing efforts to improve it further. We’re also working with hardware and software vendors to adapt drivers and graphics APIs to the way games use these systems in practice." - Epic Games</em></p>
<p>Epic ends the post with a few bits of useful advice for game developers on ensuring a smoother experience.</p>

      <title>Get ready for a smashing time as Wreckfest 2 comes to Early Access in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bugbear and THQ Nordic have announced that the chaotic racer Wreckfest 2 is set for an Early Access release on March 20th. The first game is great fun and it's Steam Deck Verified, hopefully the sequel will run well with Proton too.</p>
<p>You're in for a smashing time on this one, as it's full-contact racing. No shiny super cars, just lots of dented vehicles with crazy drivers. As they said: "As Early Access progresses, you'll be able to build the banger of your dreams and transform your battered ride into a wrecking machine! New cars and other vehicles will be added as the game evolves". A much less serious game compared to a lot of other racers and I'm all for it. This is the type of game where you can really just blow off some steam.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z2PCl64qnng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/671c9aa5735c4530952595198c95e3e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z2PCl64qnng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unmatched racing experience - </strong>Brace yourself for the most phenomenal full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw dropping moments of chaos and destruction, powered by the overhauled physics engine. Race in intense head-to-head fights on courses featuring high-speed circuits, crazy courses with obstacles &amp; jumps, intersections and oncoming traffic, or go for demolition domination in derby mode.<br/>
<em>- More and more tracks &amp; arenas will be added during the Early Access phase -</em></li>
<li><strong>Awesome &amp; customizable cars - </strong>Forget pristine supercars: Our cars are old, dented and patched together. Each of them tells a story, and you can tell your own by customizing your ride. Over the course of early access, more and more customization options will be added to the game. They will not only unlock your creative desires, but also contain new armor and component types that support certain playstyles.<br/>
<em>- Later during Early Access, you can also share your designs with other racers and wreckers! -</em></li>
<li><strong>Fully revamped game modes - </strong>Launching into early access with the base game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer mode. During the Early Access phase, we will add a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle and guides you on your journey to become a true champion! For online racers there will be new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues coming as well!</li>
<li><strong>Challenges - </strong>Another highlight during the Early Access phase will be special challenges, putting you behind the steering wheel of unconventional vehicles that were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack! Various bite-sized scenarios will keep you hooked as you battle for the highest scores.</li>
<li><strong>Tournaments - </strong>Players can also look forward to tournaments that will be implemented during the Early Access phase. Here you can earn unique rewards in special events - events which test more than just your driving skills!</li>
<li><strong>Mod Support - </strong>During the Early Access phase, mod support will be added so you can really mess with this game by installing various mods from the Steam Workshop.</li>

      <title>Killing Floor 3 is set for release on March 25 with &#34;even more realistic carnage&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tripwire Interactive recently announced that their co-op action horror FPS, Killing Floor 3, will be releasing on March 25.</p>
<p>I have very fond memories of putting lots of hours into the first game years ago, although I did entirely skip the second game. Third time's a charm? Killing Floor 3 does look and sound awesome. And unless they do something strange, it should work well with Proton on Linux platforms. Another good online co-op game to keep an eye on if that's your sort of thing.</p>
<p>There's also going to be an early closed-beta you can <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sign up</a> for with a new short trailer:</p>

<li><strong>Relentless Zeds</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>– Players will face the most lethal zeds yet. Every enemy has been redesigned with advanced methods of mobility, attack, and re-tuned with smarter AI; making them faster, deadlier, and more strategic than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Deadly Weapons</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>– From flamethrowers to shotguns to katanas, players will have an expansive arsenal at their disposal, fully customizable with hundreds of mods, gadgets, and skills to choose from to fit their unique brand of bloodletting.</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous Locations</strong> – Players will drop into a variety of treacherous hot zones to contain further spread of the Outbreak. Interactive environments give players dynamic advantages by activating turrets, fans, and other devastating traps.</li>
<li><strong>More Gore</strong> – The M.E.A.T. System returns to deliver even more realistic carnage. Featuring additional points of dismemberment and persistent blood, the game responds to attacks with gruesome authenticity.</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Eyes of War is a medieval eta RTS from Good Mood Games that just hit the big 1.0. It's an usual RTS where you can jump right into playing as a single character. You can play single-player or online with others. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It has all the usual points you have come to know and love from such an RTS. There's base-building and big battles, but the key here is in how you control everything. While you can move big groups around, you can also get up close and personal in a third-person mode to join in on the fun of the battles to try and turn the tide of war. There's even an Arena Mode which focuses on putting your third-person action skills to the test.</p>

      <title>Atari announced Breakout Beyond, a fresh spin on the classic from the devs of BIT.TRIP</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Breakout franchise is making a full return, with Atari announcing Breakout Beyond, developed by Choice Provisions (the studio behind BIT.TRIP). Not quite the classic you remember. They're saying it's a reimagining of the series that invites players to break on through to the other side.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this neon-infused twist on the classic 1976 arcade game, players smash through each puzzle by clearing bricks to reach the final goal. However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in Breakout."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-wKT_MzXDTE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a0b9f8afcddf745811494f868014cab1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-wKT_MzXDTE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release sent today: it was originally slated as an Amico Intellivision exclusive back in 2020, Atari agreed to acquire and complete the development of the title. “We’re thrilled to be able to bring this gem to our players,” said Ethan Stearns, Senior Director of Games Publishing at Atari. “The team thought it was a brilliant concept, preserving the heart of Breakout’s gameplay while also giving the formula a completely new spin. Breakout Beyond is a worthy new entry into the Breakout pantheon, and we can’t wait to see the insane combos brick-breakers will make.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard.</li>
<li>72 challenging levels that will put players’ brick-breaking skills to the test.</li>
<li>Two-player co-op to manage (or ramp up) the chaos with a friend.</li>
<li>Procedural audio and visual effects that increase in intensity with each combo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like you'll need Proton to run it on Linux.</p>

      <title>The latest Valve Steam Console rumour with AMD RDNA4 can be safely ignored - here&#39;s why</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 05/02/25 09:12am UTC</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais quoted this very article on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lhflptgruk2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> to note "Thank you... we've done pre-release Mesa Vulkan work on every AMD architecture since Vega thanks to them kindly providing hardware, so there's nothing meaningful to read into there."</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original (and clearly correct) article below:</em></p>
<p>Thanks to posts on social media and YouTuber videos, which now other news sites have picked up, we're seeing fresh rumours about a new Steam Machine / Steam Console.</p>
<p>A lot of it seems to have come from <a href="https://x.com/HandleDeck/status/1886724649750302816" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@HandleDeck</a> on X, in a post where they suggest and speculate on future Valve hardware that was then picked up in a video from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f3D79aoro8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">eXtas1s</a>" on YouTube, and now multiple bigger news websites have decided to run with it.</p>
<p>What's the story here: Valve developer Samuel Pitoiset added a update in the documentation for the open source Mesa graphics drivers recently to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/33281/diffs?commit_id=b3cff84e0607f1ecf433fe51f65d4dc725054ce9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">note</a> AMD RDNA4 support "should be good enough", just part of the release notes for an upcoming Mesa release, which was shared by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-25.0-RADV-RDNA4-State" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>. For people who don't regularly follow Linux, this seems to have caused their brains to wildly speculate on new Valve hardware coming, and it's now being spun into a rumour of Valve competing with Microsoft and Sony for the console space.</p>
<p><em>You could run this rumour any time a Valve contracted developer updates Mesa for newer AMD hardware.</em></p>
<p>Here's why I believe the rumours are plain and simply incorrect: Valve have paid developers to work on the AMD Mesa drivers for <em>years</em> at this point, to improve Linux as a whole and ensure Linux drivers are in a good state for upcoming and future AMD hardware. Valve invest in a lot of different areas for Linux, not all of it specifically just for their own hardware. A lot of their contracted developers just work on regular upgrades and improvements like this. Valve have done this for a long time now that we've been covering here.</p>
<p>This isn't to say Valve definitely aren't working on future hardware, they're always seemingly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-may-be-working-on-a-new-kind-of-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">working on <em>something</em></a>, just that <u><em>this specific new rumour</em></u> is wrong based on where they're getting their information from — a small documentation update for upcoming Mesa driver upgrades (that traditional desktop Linux uses, as well as Valve's SteamOS).</p>
<p>A fair amount of previous rumours ended up being for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's wider SteamOS push on more devices</a>. This Mesa update helps with the SteamOS push too, so you could <em>eventually</em> run SteamOS on any of your own AMD RDNA4 devices. Again, it's not specific to Valve hardware.</p>
<p>Valve already have their hands full with all this, and it's a lot of work to add in another system, so they're clearly not yet ready for it. They've already said the hardware for a Steam Deck 2 simply isn't there yet for a generational leap, so it won't be that either. <em>Just don't expect a new home console from Valve any time soon.</em></p>
<p>I fully expect the next hardware to come from Valve will be a new VR headset to replace the ageing Valve Index.</p>

      <title>UK gov responds to the newer Stop Killing Games petition - no plans to amend UK consumer law</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second Stop Killing Games petition in the UK crossed over 10,000 signatures, and so the government have responded with a full statement.</p>
<p>As a reminder: this is the initiative started up by YouTuber Ross Scott / of Accursed Farms, resulting from Ubisoft shutting down The Crew and preventing people who purchased it from playing it. The first UK petition had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/uk-government-replies-to-petition-about-requiring-publishers-to-keep-games-working/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">government response last year</a>, which really just reiterated the current consumer laws.</p>
<p>This second petition also now has a reply from the UK government and it's clear they have zero plans to change anything right now. Here's their reply in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government recognises concerns raised by video games users regarding the operability of purchased products. As the lead department for video games, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) regularly engages industry representatives and monitors how consumers interact with games. We work with the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) as the lead department for consumer protection more generally.</p>
<p>We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued. We have no plans to amend existing consumer law on digital obsolescence, but we will monitor this issue and consider the relevant work of the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) on consumer rights and consumer detriment.</p>
<p>Video games sellers must comply with existing consumer law – this includes the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs). We have provided details of relevant protections below. However, there is no requirement in UK law for software companies to support older versions of their products. Decision-making is for those companies, taking account of commercial and regulatory factors and complying with existing consumer law. There may be occasions where companies make decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for games with declining user bases.</p>
<p>The CRA gives consumers important rights when they make a contract with a trader for the supply of digital content, requiring it to be of satisfactory quality, fit for a particular purpose and as described by the seller. It may be difficult and expensive for businesses to maintain support for old software, particularly if it needs to interact with new technologies. However, if software is offered for sale that is not supported by the provider, then this should be made clear, for example on product webpages and physical packaging.</p>
<p>If digital content does not meet these quality rights, the consumer is entitled to a repair or replacement or, if not possible, some money back up to 100% of the cost of the digital content. These rights apply to intangible digital content like a PC game, as well as tangible content like a physical copy of a game. The CRA has a limit of up to six years after a breach of contract during which a consumer can take legal action.</p>
<p>A trader or third party can upgrade and improve the features of digital content so long as it continues to match any description given by the trader and conforms with any pre-contract information provided by the trader, unless varied by express agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, the CRA requires that the terms and conditions applied by a trader to a product they sell must not be unfair and must be prominent and transparent. If not, they may also be challenged and the question of fairness is a matter for the courts. Terms found to be unfair are not binding on the consumer.</p>
<p>The CPRs require information to consumers to be clear and correct and prohibit commercial practices which through false information or misleading omissions cause the average consumer to make a different choice. As such, the regulations prohibit commercial practices which omit or hide information which the average consumer needs to make an informed choice, and prohibits traders from providing material information in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner. If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPRs may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances.</p>
<p>The CPRs are enforced by Trading Standards and the CMA. If consumers believe that there has been a breach of these regulations, they should report it to the Citizens Advice helpline (or Advice Direct Scotland for those living in Scotland) which is a free service advising on rights and how to take their case forward. The helplines will refer complaints to Trading Standards and CMA where appropriate. Consumers can also pursue private redress through the courts where a trader has provided misleading information on a product.<br/>
<br/>
The CPRs section of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Act 2024 is expected to come into effect in April 2025. It restates and updates the CPRs into primary legislation, revokes the 2008 regulations and sets out rules around unfair trading. The Act:<br/>
● Provides the Secretary of State with the power to add, amend, or remove a description of a commercial practice which are in all circumstances considered unfair<br/>
● Provides clarification that someone facilitating supply or promotion of a product is a ‘trader’ and must comply with consumer law</p>
<p>The use of this power will be kept under review – any amendments proposed are subject to a duty to consult with stakeholders and approval by both Houses of Parliament.<br/>
Department for Culture, Media and Sport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, these types of petitions aren't going to really help anything right now.</p>
<p>For now, your best bet is to be on the lookout for games that force an online connection and look to a different game. What we can perhaps hope for instead though, is to have stores like Steam require developers to clearly state on store pages if there's a forced online requirement, much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they now require for for kernel-level anti-cheat</a>. Valve also made a tweak on Steam to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-purchases-now-clearly-state-youre-just-getting-a-license-not-ownership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more clearly note you're buying a license</a> last year too, you don't actually own what you buy.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes up The Finals and No Man&#39;s Sky VR with Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Proton Experimental update from Valve has landed fixing up issues with two games for Linux / Steam Deck so here's what's new. This follows on from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/proton-hotfix-updated-to-get-the-finals-working-again-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Proton Hotfix</a> for The Finals. Confused yet? See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in my guide on all the Proton versions</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The two fixes Valve noted are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed The Finals crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed No Man's Sky failing to boot in VR mode after a recent game update.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1753916821738664133gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - THE FINALS on Linux</em></p>
<p>It will just show up in your Steam Downloads as an update for Proton Experimental. The Finals is already set for Proton Experimental by default, but you'll need to swap it over for No Man's Sky VR in settings -&gt; compatibility. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in our guide on changing Proton versions</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app makes improvements to Collections, fixes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Script Extender on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app has another update out, this time with more UI changes and improvements to the Collections system along with bug fixes. Still in Alpha, with a limited selection of supported games, but they're working on supporting more games.</p>
<p>For the Collections feature it will now sit at the top if you have some installed, along with being read-only when you first add them to ensure "you get the full experience the curator intended". Downloading and installing mod collections was also improved, along with a UI change to show you when a collection has been updated. They also said "mod updates are coming soon".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9802176141738593915gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>All the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Workspace Improvements</strong></p>
<p>We've made several improvements to the behaviour of the left menu in your Workspaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left menu has been reorganised with the Library at the top, the mods in your loadout in the middle, and the extra utilities at the bottom.</li>
<li>Pages in the left menu will now show active/selected states based on which panels/tabs are open and in view.</li>
<li>Tooltips have been added to the left menu items so you can always see the full name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mod Thumbnails</strong></p>
<p>We've added the mod page image as a thumbnail in the Library, My Mods, and Collection Download pages. It's a small change, but we think it makes a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new error pop-up when the app encounters an unexpected error. This can be turned off in the Settings.</li>
<li>Added CLI commands to allows users to delete files from the hidden Override folder where this has compromised their setup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Health Checks not refreshing properly when the Loadout changes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when installing Baldur's Gate 3 Script Extender on Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, a Command Prompt window will appear behind the app while it is running.</li>
<li>When viewing a read-only collection, it is still possible to toggle individual mods on and off, but this does not affect your loadout.</li>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections does not show the correct value.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The "Switch View" option does not persist in the Library/Installed Mods view.</li>
<li>The "Load Order" heading toggle does not persist in the Load Order view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm really looking forward to Nexus adding the likes of Skyrim and Fallout into this one, it's what many keep asking for. Their <a href="https://trello.com/b/gPzMuIr3/nexus-mods-app-roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> clearly shows Bethesda games are planned, so it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.7.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Run a game store and go through gaming history in GSC - Game Store Chronicle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Imponix Game Studio have announced GSC - Game Store Chronicle, a management simulator where you run your very own game store.</p>
<p>They say it's "not just another simulator" like we've seen quite a lot of pop up recently including Supermarket Simulator, TCG Card Shop Simulator, Grocery Store Simulator, Clothing Store Simulator and various others, as it "features a timeline tied to gaming industry history, letting you follow the greatest consoles, games, and moments through the generations".</p>
<p>The first trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="foXS-oSy1H8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/75fef4918997e0a82ef12809e2720785.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/foXS-oSy1H8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the very first console launches to the dawn of iconic gaming eras, your store will grow alongside the industry. Organize shelves, create attractive displays, and ensure your shop is the go-to destination for gaming enthusiasts. Make every decision count—your store layout and product selection are key to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every decision you make shapes your business—from product selection to pricing strategies. Will you build a thriving store that becomes a gaming hub, or will you fall behind as trends shift and evolve? The choice is yours in this vibrant simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer confirmed Linux / Steam Deck support on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imponix.com/post/3lh2swsioas2o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course it will have! Steamdeck and Linux, in fact, this one I'll do better testing on desktop Linux. VoS I did test directly on Steamdeck, but not on desktop linux, just through players feedbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due out sometime in Q3 2025.</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH gets stability fixes and a Steam Deck graphics setting tweak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH has its first post-release patch to improve how it runs across all systems, with some useful improvements.</p>
<p>Version 1.001 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall game stability, including several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed the graphics preset to be set to 'Low' when launching for the first time on Steam Deck, even when save data is linked from the cloud. (The next time the game is launched on Steam Deck, the saved settings will be applied.)</li>
<li>When playing on a PC that supports NVIDIA DLSS, the default setting for 'Anti-Aliasing Method' is now set to 'DLSS'.</li>
<li>The DirectStorage DLL (Dynamic Link Library) has been updated to the latest version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8490529261738580976gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For some reason certain developers keep syncing up graphics settings to the Steam Cloud. Something that really <em>shouldn't</em> be done, as it can cause all sorts of problems when playing across different systems. In this case, moving between a PC and Steam Deck caused the Steam Deck to try and run the much higher settings. Hopefully this will no longer happen now, and hopefully in future developers will just stop doing that entirely.</p>
<p>If you missed it: Valve recently updated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-work-better-on-linux-steam-deck-with-the-latest-proton-hotfix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Hotfix to make it run smoother on Linux / Steam Deck</a>.</p>

      <title>1997 classic adventure The Space Bar upgraded with ScummVM and Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic revived. The ZOOM Platform recently announced that the 1997 classic adventure The Space Bar has been upgraded to use ScummVM and there's now a Linux version to go with it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the announcement the ZOOM Platform said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first released The Space Bar, the engine source code was considered lost. However, in early 2024, the Boffo Intergalactic Games team was able to locate it. We shared the source code with the team at ScummVM to ensure this classic adventure game was preserved. The Space Bar can now be enjoyed on any ScummVM supported system. Using ScummVM, we've updated the game on <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/the-space-bar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2253580/The_Space_Bar/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. You can now run the game natively on Windows, Linux and MacOS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More about the game: "A shapeshifting assassin is loose on the planet Armpit VI, and all signs of its whereabouts point to a local space bar, 'The Thirsty Tentacle'. You are the only human on this bizarre planet, who happens to be a telepathic detective tasked with tracking down this dangerous criminal."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PCSX2 is a free and open source Sony PS2 Emulator, and it seems they're working towards ensuring it has full support for Wayland on Linux.</p>
<p>Back with the 2.0 release in July 2024, the developers switched over from wxWidgets to a much more modern Qt for the interface. And now, they're looking to upgrade again to Qt 6.9 which should arrive in March, and bring with it support for the modern Wayland protocol on Linux.</p>
<p>As they announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pcsx2.bsky.social/post/3lh247gkfvc2q" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@PCSX2/113923210493503370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few of the project members are looking at Qt 6.9 as a way to finally get #Wayland working with PCSX2 on #Linux. We're going to keep testing, but we haven't found any problems so far. Qt 6.9's final release is on 18 March. We hope to see Wayland support in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While technically it has Wayland support, in a way, it was <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/10179" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previously</a> disabled by default due to lots of issues.</p>
<p>Going by their current compatibility page there's now 97.92% of the PS2 library at least playable, with only 0.22% noting they can only get just into the menus so it's looking great.</p>

      <title>Video Game History Foundation launches a digital archive free for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving everyone free access to their new launch (well, it's in "early access"), the Video Game History Foundation have put up their digital archive of video game history research materials.</p>
<p>This was originally announced <a href="https://gamehistory.org/introducing-the-vghf-digital-library/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in late 2023</a>, the idea is to give you an easy way to access various historic collections of video game development materials, magazines, artwork, ephemera and more. There's already a huge amount of resources available in it (they say there's over "1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines—including game industry trade magazines rarely available to the public") which includes some never-before-seen game development materials.</p>
<p>Check out their announcement video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6Tysm_Wf60Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbf45e9b0f1b9007a3538b514253ebf8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6Tysm_Wf60Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To make it all actually work they even built a new "state-of-the-art text recognition toolset that makes even the wildest, weirdest video game magazines and promotional materials fully text-searchable". This is a wonderful initiative to ensure gaming history of all forms is not lost. Love seeing more preservation efforts like this.</p>

      <title>Physics building game Besiege gets a big 10 year anniversary update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Besiege from Spiderling Studios just had a big free upgrade for all players to celebrate the 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>More about it: Besiege is a physics building game about constructing mechanical machines to annihilate armies, obliterate castles and overcome challenging obstacles. Conquer the campaign or skirmish with friends in Multiplayer!</p>
<p>They put up a new showcase video for the event you can see below, and they said to expect other events throughout the year. A roadmap for 2025 and beyond updates is also going to be announced, as it seems they're going to continue expanding the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7Yk_dBLvH0g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e5786590427c7f5aad10d265f73206c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7Yk_dBLvH0g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Update Highlights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Trading Cards, Emotes, Backgrounds, and Badges: Celebrate the Besiege journey with collectible Steam trading cards, custom emotes, backgrounds, and unique badges to showcase on your profile.</li>
<li>The Remaster of the Original Sandbox: Revisit the beloved sandbox that launched Besiege’s legacy, allowing players to relive the charm of the game’s early days while building and experimenting in a remaster of the classic environment.</li>
<li>Scoreboard System: Compete against yourself and Besiege’s other players with a brand-new scoreboard system for tracking stats and ranking the performance of your builds. From speed records to destruction efficiency, the scoreboard adds a competitive layer to the fun and the motivation to challenge yourself and refine your machines.</li>
<li>New Achievements and Campaign Content: Unlock brand-new achievements that push the boundaries of your creativity and skill and enjoy refreshing new content in some of the campaign’s classic levels.</li>
<li>Rulers in Campaign Levels: The rulers of each campaign island now exist in game, fighting alongside their armies in defence of their kingdoms. Each ruler has a unique style that brings a new layer of personality to your campaign conquests.</li>
<li>Original 2015 Early Access Version: Take a nostalgic trip to the past with access to the original 2015 Early Access version via Steam’s beta system. Relive the game’s humble beginnings and see how far it’s come.</li>
<li>Automatic Timescale Adjustment: This new innovative feature provides a smoother player experience by automatically adjusting the timescale slider, enabling slow motion during hardware-intensive moments and complex physics simulations. Say goodbye to frame rate drops and enjoy the added bonus of watching Besiege’s beautiful, chaotic, destruction in slow motion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"This update is more than a celebration of our game's history, it’s a thank-you to the community that has supported us for the past decade," said Spiderling Studios. "We’re proud to commemorate Besiege’s legacy with content &amp; features that blend nostalgia with innovation, enhancing the existing campaign and providing new challenges for players."</p>

      <title>The Sims and The Sims 2 officially return with a Legacy Collection for each</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The rumours were true, EA have re-released the classics. The Sims Legacy Collection and The Sims 2 Legacy Collection are live on Steam now. Both include a bunch of previously released DLC for each game.</p>
<p>Of course, since it's EA, you also have to deal with: "EA online activation and EA app software installation and background use required" and also Denuvo Anti-tamper. Should still work fine on Linux with Valve's Proton though, apart from the occasional EA app blip. Valve rated The Sims 1 as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable, currently no rating on The Sims 2.<br/>
<em><strong>Update: 19:54 UTC</strong> - EA have removed the mention of the EA app and Denuvo on both.</em></p>
<p>The Sims Legacy Collection includes: The Sims, The Sims 4 Throwback Fit Kit. Plus The Sims packs: The Sims Livin’ Large, , The Sims House Party, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar and The Sims Makin’ Magic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346728411738340014gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Sims</em></p>
<p>The Sims 2: Legacy Collection includes The Sims 2 and The Sims 4: Grunge Revival Kit, plus the following The Sims 2 packs: The Sims 2: University, The Sims 2: Nightlife, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff, The Sims 2: H&amp;M Fashion Stuff, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: Kitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff, and The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff.</p>

      <title>Warner Bros platform fighter MultiVersus goes offline for good in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Player First Games / Warner Bros. Games have announced that the Super Smash Bros.-like game MultiVersus is officially closing.</p>
<p>Technically, this is the second time it's being closed. It originally launched in 2022 in what they called a Beta, which they then closed in 2023, with a proper relaunch in May 2024. This time though it seems it's not going to be coming back, as they're pulling all online features and you will not be able to download it either (unless you already have it added to your library - it's a free to play game).</p>
<p>In a short and blunt <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818750/view/509570438492325577" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Season 5 will serve as the final seasonal content update for MultiVersus. As January 31, 2025, real money transactions are no longer available. Season 5 will begin on February 4, 2025, and run through May 30, 2025. All online features will continue to be available until Season 5 concludes on May 30, at which point MultiVersus will no longer be available to play online or download. Unused Gleamium and character tokens can be used to access and purchase content in-game until the end of Season 5 on May 30. To play MultiVersus offline after May 30, download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, between February 4 and May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7864378551738338168gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> it doesn't have all that many players left. It's seen a steady decline after each time it was released and then re-released. While talking player numbers isn't always a useful thing, in this case it's a multiplayer-focused title so it seems fitting when you see that it had a 24 hour peak online player-count of only 648 players. Which would be mostly fine for a smaller game, but this was a game with major licensed characters.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> last year, taken from a financial call, "MultiVersus' failure had added another $100 million to the $200 million writedown the company's games business had already suffered earlier this year". Seems they had some seriously inflated expectations for this one.</p>
<p>At least for people who like it you'll still be able to play offline. MultiVersus works on Linux with Proton and is rated Playable on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Linux performance overlay MangoHud 0.8.0-rc1 out now for testing with Intel GPU support and lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is a performance overlay you can use on Desktop Linux, and it's what powers the built-in overlay on Steam Deck. A new release candidate is now available for testing for an upcoming stable release with version 0.8.0-rc1.</p>
<p>This release adds a few more applications to the blacklist to stop it appearing and causing issues with them including the Ubisoft Store (UplayWebCore.exe), halloy (IRC client) and Plutonium Launcher (plutonium.exe, plutonium-launcher-win32.exe).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7912058801738327495gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7912058801738327495gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stalker 2 on Linux with MangoHud, click image to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>If you like my simple horizontal layout you can find it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Just pop it into "~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf".</p>
<p>Also some fixes made it in including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">read_cfg</code> didn't properly overwrite config options.</li>
<li>logging would sometimes crash if it returned an empty vec.</li>
<li>fix double-logging of avg fps.</li>
<li>nvidia: warn if both nvml and xnvctrl are unavailable.</li>
<li>mangoapp didn't properly respond to hide/show hud.</li>
<li>add 32bit xkbcommon to project dependencies.</li>
<li>add missing dependencies for opensuse.</li>
<li>proper vsync implementation.</li>
<li>refactor FPS calculation in metrics.</li>
<li>fix exec, network, gpu and vram displaying incorrectly in horizontal mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Various other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple GPUs can be displayed</li>
<li>Changed logger errors to debug</li>
<li>Added CPU power to logging</li>
<li>Improved wayland keybinds</li>
<li>Memory usage has been refactored to be inline with other apps</li>

<li>mangoapp vulkan layer is deleted (it was a testing project and no longer in development)</li>
<li>OpenGL shim
	<ul>
<li>The shim is preloaded first instead of the opengl library</li>
<li>it checks to make sure there is an opengl context to hook before loading mangohud</li>
<li>this should resolve some crashes. More detailed information here <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/c22ced01083fd32476b0bdd8b969ee749631469a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">c22ced0</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using exec and inside steam runtime, launch command using <code class="inline-code">steam-runtime-launch-client</code>
<ul>
<li>If mangohud is used inside flatpak, you need to allow your app to speak on <code class="inline-code">org.freedesktop.Flatpak</code> dbus address.</li>
<li>Example if you're using mangohud in steam: <code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Intel GPUs support (integrated and discrete, i915 and xe drivers)

      <title>Calamities are coming to Old World in the Wrath of Gods DLC plus they hit a big sales milestone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mohawk Games have announced the Old World - Wrath of Gods is coming on March 4, which has some big new features and content, plus they've hit a nice sales milestone. Old World has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZD4umDe1MHU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/721b434de6c45c328eae2f3bd017518c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZD4umDe1MHU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you'll get is the big new dedicated Wrath of Gods scenario. Here you will lead your nation while heeding the ever-increasing (and conflicting) demands of their nation’s pantheon. Problem is - you can't keep them happy all the time so they will end up unleashing one of nine new calamities. The developers said "Calamities work in the base game as well (but without the gods metagame) and come with new visual and environmental effects, such as heavy flooding that can change land tiles into water or certain disasters that change the resources a tile offers".</p>
<p>There's also the new Aksum playable nation from Northeast Africa. Aksum comes with five dynasties headed by legendary figures from the nation's past along with two unique units, their own special events and more.</p>
<p>You can also expect a "smattering of general content" being added to the game as well.</p>
<p>On top of that they've revealed they've now hit 300,000 sales since the full 2022 release. Nice to see another 4x grand strategy game doing well. Especially nice that it has full Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Free tense horror game Those Who Crawl about exploring shrinking caves added Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released in 2022, Hush Fin Games have upgraded the free game Those Who Crawl, which now includes Linux and Steam Deck support. They're currently working on a VR version, and decided to port over a bunch of improvements.</p>
<p>More about it: "​As you progressed through the cave tunnels, they slowly tightened until you could not even stand. Now, as you crawl, you wonder if you are not alone in the darkness. Those Who Crawl is a tense horror game about crawling and climbing through cave tunnels. Each hand is controlled individually with a unique crawling and climbing system."</p>

      <title>Minecraft gets new types of cows, a firefly bush and more ambient sounds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/minecraft-gets-new-pigs-wildflowers-and-ambient-features-in-the-latest-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous testing snapshot update for Minecraft</a> that added in new pigs, wildflowers and ambient features there's another snapshot available for testing with more new content. <em>Head over to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/an-idiots-guide-to-setting-up-minecraft-on-steam-deck-steamos-with-controller-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide for installing Minecraft on Steam Deck</a>.</em></p>
<p>With this update two new cow variants are joining Minecraft with the snow biome fluffy cow, along with the auburn warm cow that can be found in sandy biomes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20311285601738324626gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Perhaps a bit more exciting is the new firefly bush. A new plant block that spawns dancing firefly particles that glow in the dark. You can also place this block below other blocks to give them a bit of a sparkle - sounds sweet. There's also a new bush block you can find across forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/203243241738324649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally they've further expanded the ambient sounds into the desert. This includes the chirping of crickets, rustling twigs, and howling winds. You can bring some of it with you by placing down the dead bush on two sand blocks outside, or by clustering several sand or terracotta blocks together.</p>
<p>All of the changes will be coming to first the upcoming stable 2025 update sometime hopefully soon but you can test them all in the snapshot right now in Minecraft Java.</p>

      <title>The Spell Brigade gets lots of gameplay improvements plus a UI update for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Spell Brigade is a popular survivor-like with online co-op for up to 4 players, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-spell-brigade-is-an-online-co-op-survivor-like-bullet-hell-friendly-fire-chaos-festival/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's sold well</a> and the developers continue making big improvements to it. The Spell Brigade has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What makes it different is not just the online co-op play but the team-based objectives too, giving you a fun spin and with various overpowered spell synergies it can be a lot of fun. It's not finished though, with it being in Early Access. The latest update adds in some new content including a new lobby, two new objectives, a visual revamp of the interface, some visual tweaks and quite a lot of general gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>This includes a tweak for Steam Deck players where they "Increased the size of the XP bar, HP bar and Spell Slots to improve readability".</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH should work better on Linux / Steam Deck with the latest Proton Hotfix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH is rated as Steam Deck Verified, it did launch with some problems on Linux / Steam Deck but Valve's Proton developers are moving quickly to improve it.</p>
<p>VKD3D-Proton, the layer that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan, had some updates to work around some issues that have been seen. Developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2624835518" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> "For AMD hangs, we have two game workarounds merged now which have successfully worked around some hangs on our end at least" and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/2319" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Add PSO retain workaround for FFVII Rebirth.</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/2320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Workaround missing CS barrier in Rebirth.</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those have been merged into VKD3D-Proton, and a new <strong>Proton Hotfix</strong> update has been made available, which Valve have now set as the default for FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH. So if you have set a specific Proton version on it, you should unselect it to get it to use the latest Proton Hotfix and get a more stable experience right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8225680071738315747gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p>At least for AMD GPU users it will be better now but we're still waiting for NVIDIA driver updates to improve the situation there on Desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 570.86.16 released with VRR for multiple displays and lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released the 570.86.16 Beta driver for Linux which includes various new features, and a few good bug fixes too. Quite an exciting one too since it brings support for VRR on systems with multiple displays.</p>
<p>This is a Beta driver available for preview, but it should be good enough for most gamers to use but it may also come with issues as it hasn't yet been through their full testing like their certified drivers.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New Features and Tweaks:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for VRR on systems with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to use NVML rather than NV-CONTROL to control GPU clocks and fan speed. This allows related functionality to work when using Wayland, where the NV-CONTROL X extension is not available. Note that as a result, some operations which were previously available to unprivileged users, due to the privileges of the X server, may now require elevated privileges.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve performance on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to resolve a corruption issue on Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the VK_KHR_incremental_present extension.</li>
<li>Updated GPU overclocking control to be available by default in nvidia-settings, for GPU boards that support programmable clock control. Previously, this was only available when bit 3 was set in the "Coolbits" X config option.</li>
<li>Disabled a power saving feature on Ada and above generation GPUs for surfaces allocated with the DRM Dumb-Buffers API, for example, when using a DRM fbdev. The power saving feature could cause black screens for DRM Dumb-Buffers which use front buffer rendering instead of KMS flips.</li>
<li>Added support for querying Dynamic Boost status via the 'power' file in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*.</li>
<li>Enabled 32 bit compatibility support for the NVIDIA GBM backend.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Added /usr/share/nvidia/files.d/sandboxutils-filelist.json which lists all the driver files used by container runtime environments such as nvidia-container-toolkit and enroot.</li>
<li>Added support for the systemd suspend-then-hibernate method of system sleep. This feature requires systemd version 248 or newer.</li>
<li>Enabled the nvidia-drm fbdev=1 option by default. When supported by the kernel and the nvidia-drm modeset=1 option is enabled, nvidia-drm will replace the system's framebuffer console with one driven by DRM.<br/>
	This feature can be disabled by setting fbdev=0.</li>
<li>Implemented a feature that allows low latency display interrupts to be serviced even when the system is under heavy contention. This is especially useful for reducing stutter when using virtual reality.<br/>
	This feature is experimental and disabled by default.<br/>
	This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>In Linux kernel 6.11, drm_fbdev_generic was renamed to drm_fbdev_ttm. Use drm_fbdev_ttm when present to keep supporting direct framebuffer access needed for Wayland compositors to present content on newer kernels.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. The driver now supports enumerating modes on hotplug events through the DRM fbdev API.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, intended to be included in Linux kernel 6.12, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. Populating modes for DRM connectors during hotplug events will not be supported with r535 and kernels containing the relevant commit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when querying VRR attributes on some monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some Vulkan applications to crash when responding to window resize events.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-threaded OpenGL applications, for example Civilization 6, to crash when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause games to crash when the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable was set to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, introduced in 555.58, where some DVI outputs would not work with HDMI monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause external displays to become frozen until the next modeset when using PRIME Display Offloading with the NVIDIA dGPU acting as the display offload sink.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Open source RTS 0 A.D. Alpha 27 released bringing a new Vulkan renderer, new maps, AMD FSR and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free, open source and cross-platform RTS 0 A.D. Alpha 27 is now finally available and it brings with it a whole lot of new features and content. Alpha 26 was all the way back in 2022, so it's been a while, but it looks like the wait was worth it!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">New features highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vulkan Renderer.</li>
<li>Multiplayer Savegames.</li>
<li>Tips &amp; Tricks Page.</li>
<li>Naval Overhaul.</li>
<li>Observer Flares.</li>
<li>New random maps: Foothills, Migration, Coast Range; New skirmish map: Isthmus of Corinth; and updated skirmish maps: Watering Holes, Sporades Islands.</li>
<li>New and updated art.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3MhcRPm7Zhg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c87fd27136abb6533f05e58d5d13c35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3MhcRPm7Zhg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some more of what's new includes AMD FSR support, GPU Skinning config option that can boost FPS, various technical upgrades to their underlying tech, various civilizations should now feel more unique and more.</p>
<p>With this release they're also moving away from the Alpha label on the game. The next will simply be known as "Release 28". They mentioned how the game at this stage is "polished in many aspects, sometimes more so than some released professional strategy games, but not feature-complete", noting how the gaming industry as a whole has changed since their early releases with Early Access and so they don't really feel the "Alpha-Beta-Release plan" doesn't seem relevant for them now. Plus, they would plan to continue after the "final release" as well.</p>
<p>For developers, they also finally moved from SVN to a more modern <a href="https://gitea.wildfiregames.com/0ad/0ad" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Git</a> that they said "allows us to leverage powerful tools of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, improving the stability and the quality of the game during development".</p>
<p>Their team will also be present at the upcoming <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FOSDEM 2025</a> event. See all in their <a href="https://play0ad.com/new-release-0-a-d-alpha-27-agni/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>

      <title>Free bite-sized photography platformer Batography out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's short, it's cute, it's free with Linux support and it's out now on Steam. Batography is a photography platformer where you play as a curious bat on their mission to take a full-fledged photo of the moon. Here you will run, climb, glide and snap your way through an array of obstacles while interacting with the cheeky characters in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Created by SporkTank, that's mostly just solo developer Martin Stradling, it was previously released on itch.io and they also made the puzzle game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2278300/A_Symmetric_Escape/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A Symmetric Escape</a>. Batography was developed as a way to get his younger cousins involved in game development. The game was developed as a small side project whilst working on the upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2984850/Rita/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rita</a>, which was chosen for the PAX Aus Indie Showcase.</p>
<p>"While working on Rita (a game heavily inspired by family), I thought it would be nice to get a project that was actually created with family on to Steam!" Martin shared, "So here it is, a beautiful little side-scroller with sassy characters and some hidden extras. I hope you enjoy!"</p>

      <title>Put your thinking cap on for Fallacy Quiz a game that will test your reasoning skills</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released back in December that I missed, developer Tim Krief put up Fallacy Quiz, a game that tests your ability to identify misleading or incorrect reasoning. The developer emailed to note how it was made using free and open source tools on Linux with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>
<p>From the developer: "Fallacy Quiz is a game for Windows and Linux, that tests your ability to identify misleading or incorrect reasoning, also known as fallacies. Players can improve their critical thinking skills and better recognize deceptive arguments in everyday situations. They’ll be presented with various statements and must determine if they are valid or fallacious, or even identify specific fallacies in expert mode."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ajm-r5ppUwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/530e6a930bfa8c280ed1403a27bf22f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ajm-r5ppUwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solo or local multiplayer gameplay: Up to four players can play together. Two players can play on the same keyboard.</li>
<li>A lot of content: 200 questions.</li>
<li>A great variety of fallacies: 50 different fallacy types.</li>
<li>A virtual 3D book: The fallacies have definitions available in a glossary that the player can flip through as if it was a real one.</li>
<li>Two difficulty levels: In expert mode, the player must not only identify if a statement is fallacious but they must also select the specific type of fallacy.</li>
<li>A custom mode: Players can choose the difficulty, the number of rounds and questions and disable the timer if they want.</li>
<li>Achievements to unlock!</li>
<li>Available in English and in French.</li>
<li>Full controller support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It just last week had a major update too adding in a 3D virtual notebook to flip through achievements, there's a new question history screen, a secret third difficulty option, new game settings and various fixes.</p>

      <title>The End of the Sun is a Slavic fantasy time-travel adventure out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for a fresh and unusual experience? The End of the Sun is out now with Linux support taking you across time in this Slavic fantasy adventure.</p>
<p>More about it: "The End of the Sun is a first-person, adventure, story-driven mystery game, set in the fantasy world of Slavic beliefs, legends, and mythical creatures. The small village becomes a place of enigmatic events, through which the line between myth and reality begins to fade perilously."</p>
<p>Check out the new launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dbtvQ59zoqE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/422dda428627e7785b5e46429ad6a390.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dbtvQ59zoqE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Photogrammetry of ethnographic museums – To get unique graphics, we visited ethnographic museums. We scanned hundreds of objects and entire buildings, so you can admire them in the game the way they actually are.</li>
<li>Time travel – Teleport between four main seasons far away from each other by many years. Get to know the stories of the same heroes at different stages of their lives. Use your power to solve the mystery!</li>
<li>Non-linear and engaging story – Experience particular immersive stories at your own pace and at the moment you feel like it.</li>
<li>Consequences of time manipulation – Set the paths of fate and bring the course of events back on the right track to discover further fragments of the game world and story. Events from the past have an impact on the future.</li>
<li>Slavic culture – Enjoy not only the immersive story but also look at the long-forgotten everyday activities and objects that are no longer used today.</li>
<li>Exploration and Open World – Travel between the homesteads and the surroundings of the village, discovering pieces of the mystery that lies somewhere there.</li>
<li>Dynamic environment – The time of day, weather, and lighting change smoothly and dynamically right before your eyes as you discover parts of the mystery.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has full voice acting full English and Polish with subtitles available for German, Spanish, Russian, French, Czech, Simplified Chinese, Italian, and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The developer did send over a key and the Linux version runs fine, although you'll need a good system to run it on as even at 1080p on Medium it was often struggling to hit 60FPS on my Radeon 6800 XT. Featuring lots of quite beautiful scenery, and a story that really captures your attention (although it's slow going) from the very beginning. Full of mystery, the story is centred around a small valley and village where a creature resembling the mythical Phoenix which appears to be setting things ablaze. The time-travelling mechanic is interesting too, with you seeing the way time moves as you interact with the world. </p>
<p>The End of the Sun is a slow but thoughtful and thoroughly interesting adventure.</p>

      <title>NTSYNC driver support heads to Wine in a new Merge Request</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the NTSYNC driver landing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ntsync-for-proton-wine-now-in-linux-kernel-6-14-that-should-make-many-steamos-users-happy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ready for the Linux kernel 6.14 release</a>, there's now an open <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/7226" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to actually hook up support for it in Wine.</p>
<p>Opened by developer Elizabeth Figura, the request notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This introduces a faster implementation of signal and wait operations on NT events, semaphores, and mutexes, which improves performance to native levels for a wide variety of games and other applications.</p>
<p>The goal here is similar to the long-standing out-of-tree "esync" and "fsync" patch sets, but without the flaws that make those patch sets not upstreamable.</p>
<p>The Linux "ntsync" driver is not currently released. It has been accepted into the trunk Linux tree for 6.14, so barring any extraordinary circumstances, the API is frozen and it will be released in its current form in about 2 months. Since it has passed all relevant reviewers on the kernel side, and the API is all but released, it seems there is no reason any more not to submit the Wine side to match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully we shall see it soon in a fresh Wine development release. There's a few comments on it, and no doubt more will come as the code gets reviewed, so it will likely need some tweaks before it gets accepted into Wine.</p>
<p>Once ready and you have both an up to date version of Wine and Linux kernel 6.14+, you'll hopefully then get the benefits of improved Windows game compatibility on Linux. And, compared to plain Wine, better performance too. Eventually then we'll see it in a new release of Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Next-gen construction simulation RoadCraft gets a new trailer and release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the teams that gave us the popular SnowRunner and MudRunner, the next-gen construction simulation RoadCraft is looking great. I had a lot of fun getting stuck in SnowRunner, so I can't wait to see how their tech has advanced since then.</p>
<p>From the press release: "RoadCraft takes Saber’s expertise in off-road and construction simulation to new heights, introducing the studio’s first heavy-machinery simulation. Powered by a cutting-edge physics engine, players will interact with the environment like never before in an immersive experience that seamlessly blends driving, operating construction machinery, and managing reconstruction resources."</p>
<p>They've announced it's going to release May 20th and showed off a new trailer:</p>

      <title>Collabora take over libsurvive development an open source VR lighthouse tracking system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora have announced they've taken over development of libsurvive, an open source lighthouse tracking system for VR. It's now moved over to their <a href="https://github.com/collabora/libsurvive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to continue to expand.</p>
<p>The developers at Collabora continue working on Monado, the cross-platform open source OpenXR runtime that works across Android, Linux and Windows. So this seems like a perfect fit to add.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/welcoming-the-libsurvive-project.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> written by developer Frederic Plourde:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collabora's involvement in Open Source XR development continues to grow today as we welcome the <a href="https://github.com/collabora/libsurvive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">libsurvive project</a> into the fold! The open source lighthouse tracking system is entering an exciting new chapter as it transitions its ownership over to our GitHub organization where we will have two members from our XR team as official maintainers.</p>
<p>Due to other commitments, the previous maintainers have decided to step back and pass the torch to ensure the project continues to thrive. We are grateful for their contributions and look forward to supporting the project as much as we can.</p>
<p>Libsurvive is a set of open source tools and libraries that enable 6 dof tracking on lighthouse and vive-based systems, and can run on any device. It currently supports both SteamVR 1.0 and SteamVR 2.0 generation of devices, and is also easily usable with <a href="https://monado.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Monado</a>, the cross-platform, open source XR runtime.</p>
<p>This is an exciting moment to further push 6 dof tracking for all devices in a true, open source fashion. Catch us on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/7QbCAGS" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">libsurvive Discord</a> to stay in the loop for the latest news!</p>

      <title>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II from Warhorse Studios confirmed playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is quickly approaching release and it's looking good, to the point that Warhorse Studios have announced that it will be playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So far they seem to have only announced it on social media site X, with nothing noted on the Steam page, and there's no official rating posted from Valve yet. Going by their wording, I expect it will see the yellow <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable notice and not be Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5335874831738229586gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Warhorse Studios on X</em></p>
<p>This is of course good news for all other Linux systems too, since if it's playable on Steam Deck, you should have no problem running it on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>A recent story trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vPS-pgg3scE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dc82061f9e9f3e32116b07cf8befddd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vPS-pgg3scE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a true sequel to its predecessor but developed and written in such a way that it is perfect for newcomers and longtime fans alike.</p>
<p>Diving back into the heart-pounding world of 15th Century Bohemia (Central Europe), Kingdom Come: Deliverance II picks up where its predecessor left off, thrusting players into the shoes of Henry, the steadfast son of a blacksmith, embroiled in a tumultuous tale of vengeance, betrayal and self-discovery.</p>
<p>In this gripping sequel, players will traverse a meticulously crafted medieval landscape, from the humble confines of a blacksmith's forge to the grandeur of royal courts, all while navigating the treacherous currents of a kingdom torn apart by civil war.</p>

      <title>Relaxed factory automation sim Learning Factory 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few years in Early Access and it's now complete. Luden.io have released the 1.0 update for Learning Factory, a chilled factory building automation sim about supplying cats on Mars with everything they need. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: "Learning Factory is a relaxing automation game, which lets you concentrate on the most important task in the Universe: making cats happy again. You're a humble genius scientist who gets invited to become the chief engineer at an abandoned Factory on Mars, designed to produce and sell exquisite goods for cats. It was conceived to learn everything about cats and make them happy, but it is desolated now, and cats are leaving Factory Stores unhappy and empty-pawed."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PDDGuagYU68"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/531242365ac697bd82c6ae12c68b5ed3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PDDGuagYU68" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Renovate an abandoned factory on Mars.</li>
<li>Design and automate production chains.</li>
<li>Produce and sell exquisite goods to cats.</li>
<li>Collect and analyze data with Machine Learning.</li>
<li>Scale and make the factory more efficient.</li>
<li>Make cats happy!</li>
<li>Rebuild the ancient Monument.</li>
<li>Establish Catopia in the feline society!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like their previous game, the acclaimed puzzle game about machine learning while True: learn(), Learning Factory is backed by specialists in the subject, and implements real-world machine learning models.</p>
<p>I checked it out years ago and was quite impressed with it and since it has expanded massively. The game now has a Very Positive rating on Steam too.</p>

      <title>PlayStation Network requirement on PC will now be optional with in-game rewards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony have announced that their PC game releases will no longer force a PlayStation Network Account requirement. Instead it will be optional and give you certain in-game rewards.</p>
<p>As announced in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with tomorrow’s release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC, we’re working to add more benefits to playing with an account for PlayStation Network. The Last of Us Part II Remastered (coming April 3, 2025), in addition to God of War Ragnarök and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, will all soon be adding in-game content unlocks for PlayStation Network account users.</p>
<p><strong>An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC.</strong> Players who still opt to sign into a PlayStation Network account will also enjoy added benefits like trophies and friend management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7289801061738169185gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></p>
<p>They've also revealed the first few benefits for signing in:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></td>
<td>Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong></td>
<td>Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver and 250 XP)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</strong></td>
<td>+50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras<br/>
<br/>
			Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</strong></td>
<td>Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a most unexpected move but an incredibly welcome one. It caused various regions to be unable to even buy some of their PC releases but even worse, requiring an online account for single-player games should never be a thing. Nice to see some sense come back to Sony. Hopefully this will mean the region restrictions on purchases can also be lifted.</p>
<p>Sony have clearly learned some lessons, likely a fair bit from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/helldivers-2-sees-over-130k-bad-reviews-on-steam-as-sony-double-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backlash</a> they had with Helldivers 2 that eventually forced them to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/sony-gives-up-on-forcing-playstation-network-for-helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drop the requirement</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM + DOOM II adds multiplayer mod support but it&#39;s broken on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/01/25 - 18:42 UTC</strong> - An update has been released that appears to have already solved the issue. Nice to see such a quick turnaround direct from the developer on this one!</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>The updated version of DOOM + DOOM II that bundles them together with enhancements from id Software / Nightdive Studios, Bethesda just got Update #2 with more improvements for playing with mods.</p>
<p>With this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2280/view/500563239247021416" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> they've added support for mods during online play. They say game hosts need to activate it before entering the multiplayer menu, with other players needing to subscribe to the mod before joining a match. Mods for the game collection must be made with either "Vanilla DOOM, DeHackEd, MBF21 or BOOM" to be compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11643986341738168559gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Various other changes also came with the update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue in which some red doors did not display as red on the automap</li>
<li>Fixed multiple crashes reported by the community when loading game saves</li>
<li>Improved text line wrapping legibility for mod descriptions in Asian languages</li>
<li>Removed map prefix from intermission screen to be consistent with original game behavior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multiplayer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added spectator mode when players are dead and waiting to respawn in co-op mission play (it can also be initiated manually from the scoreboard button)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which disabling the crosshair would also turn off player name and co-op respawn text display</li>
<li>There are now more than 4 player colors available in game and on scoreboards</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in which players would lose weapons when respawning in co-op using modern rules</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which the cross-platform friends menu could not be properly backed out of when no friends were available</li>
<li>Further optimized multiplayer networking code</li>
<li>Addressed crosshair centering issue in certain splitscreen configurations</li>
<li>Intermission animations now run at the correct speed in splitscreen mode</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Modsl</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The mod downloader can now process more than the first 100 subscribed mods</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there's also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/595139432990916051/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> that it has been <strong><em>broken</em></strong> on Steam Deck. Causing the developer to add the previous update as a Steam Beta (no password) and edit their update announcement for anyone affected while they work on a solution.</p>
<p>Initially I got a bit confused, because both singleplayer and online play worked fine on both Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. But it's specifically playing <em>with</em> mods that causes the problem. As soon as you've got even a single mod downloaded, the game will no longer run and leads to this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21083205011738168103gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21083205011738168103gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I've noted it in the Proton GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1534#issuecomment-2622085337" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> with log files from both systems, so hopefully Valve developers can track down the issue in Proton.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Worlds Part II brings Gas Giants, New Story Missions, Trillions of New Planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games have given us another almighty whopper of an update to No Man's Sky here. The scale was already impressive and now it's just completely ridiculous. According to Managing Director Sean Murray they've added in "billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets".</p>
<p>Just a short look over what's new includes: new landscapes like mountains and deep valleys, a new class of purple star with countless new worlds to explore along with a new story, water rendering was enhanced further, deeper oceans with various aquatic lifeforms (and a scary deep water guardian), inventory sorting at the tap of a button, gas giants, a new narrative-mission, dense jungles, new local environmental hazards, a new game mode that removes all alien lifeforms, improved modding, faster game loading and so much more.</p>
<p>First up is the main trailer:</p>

<p>I'm absolutely going to have to make some time to play more soon. Can't wait to explore it all. No Man's Sky works on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Strategy business sim Summer Islands a spiritual successor to Holiday Island from 1996 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Summer Islands from Marttalin Games is a real-time strategy business simulator and after a few years of Early Access the 1.0 release is out now.</p>
<p>Clearly inspired by the classic Holiday Island, a classic from 1996. Summer Islands takes the same idea, and the same visual style, and made what you could call a spiritual successor to it. There's plenty of differences though it's not just a modern clone.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Kv1ACQHLq4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f23de49294b422802a87c1508a90e6c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Kv1ACQHLq4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can create an almost infinite number of maps with different seeds. One island, several or the Summer Islands mode. From small 100x100 maps up to 1500x1500 maps. From high mountains or just sandy islands. You'll be building up the perfect island resort filling it up with hotels, restaurants and various other tourist attractions. While also managing your income, debts, natural disasters and potential sabotage from opponents.</p>
<p>This is a classically designed building sim like the earlier Sim City, Holiday Island, Transport Tycoon and other similar games.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">I actually <em>loved</em> Holiday Island, I remember fondly how it hooked me for weeks when I first discovered it a great many years ago when I still had hair. Nice to see smaller developers bringing back such similar games.</span></p>

      <title>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is out now and looks fantastic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available with Linux support, Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter has launched from Odd Bug Studio and it looks like another hit. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More: "Fully narrated by RPG-legend, Doug Cockle, prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the northern realms of the Ratdom; an expansive, frost-bitten land on the brink of all-out war. Track down and defeat the legendary monsters of this realm, and be rewarded with rare resources with which to craft devastating equipment. But be warned, these colossal creatures won’t go down without a fight… and then some."</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZshLNCVGmz0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91dc6338dd901aa10a0b18a56695bfd4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZshLNCVGmz0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Regretfully I simply haven't had time for this one personally, haven't even finished the first game yet. But both of them appear to be well worth grabbing. It's shot up quickly to a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore a vast, wintry kingdom:</strong> Fully narrated by RPG legend Doug Cockle <em>(The Witcher </em>franchise, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3)</em> prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the northern realm and biomes of the Ratdom; an expansive, frost-bitten land on the brink of all-out war.</li>
<li><strong>Hunt down giant beasts: </strong>Track down and defeat 15 legendary beasts of the Ratdom’s northern frontier and be rewarded with rare resources with which to craft devastating equipment. But be warned, these colossal creatures won’t go down without a fight… and then some.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash the power of gods: </strong>Unlock the power of the four deities and unleash their powerful ‘Elementa’ spells in combat; harness the magics of fire, poison, ice, and electric upon the damned malevolent Dark Wings!</li>
<li><strong>Master challenging combat: </strong> Face down the Dark Wing threat in deadly battles; let the devilish bats taste steel of blade and spear, or attack at range with bolts and arrows… and set elemental traps against these marauding foes <em>(and adjust the difficulty at any point if it’s getting *too* much of a challenge – we won’t judge!)</em></li>
<li><strong>Improved base building: </strong>Construct and upgrade the devastated Rat fortress of Winter’s Edge to gain access to more powerful items from the smithy, tastier meals at the kitchen, a wider range of powerful traps from the shoppe, and more!</li>

      <title>Lucky Tower Ultimate is hilarious and now Steam Deck Verified with a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the funniest games I've had the pleasure of playing over the last year, Lucky Tower Ultimate is a gem and worth a go. Now even more so. I wrote about my appreciation of this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/lucky-tower-ultimate-is-an-absurdly-funny-dungeon-crawler-you-need-to-play/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in November last year</a>, noting how easy a recommendation it was. </p>
<p>What is it: "Lucky Tower Ultimate is a roguelite adventure game infused with slapstick humor and a hand-drawn aesthetic, where each run feels like an immersive cartoon. It continues the cult classic Flash game series about choosing between three mysterious doors. The Lucky Tower beckons seasoned fans and new players alike to experience the unique pleasure of getting all geared up just to slip on a banana peel and die."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7105846881738150486gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As of last week, it got bumped up to Steam Deck Verified thanks to upgrades to the game. The developer also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1700270/announcements/detail/521955337470739286" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> another update that's big on the technical side but sounds good for the long-term health of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Backup System</strong></p>
For this update, we added a lot of safety fallbacks and a whole new backup system to keep your files even safer! For most of you, nothing will actually change, but we did implement a few things to ensure the safety of your progress, so here's a short overview:<br/>
<p><strong>Auto Save</strong></p>
Since some people reported crashes or weird behavior when using Alt + F4, we implemented a brand new autosave feature. While you're in the village, the game will create a backup every two minutes. This way, even if your computer crashes, your progress should still be saved.<br/>
<p><strong>Daily Backups</strong></p>
Your data will now also be saved into a separate daily backup folder. Your most recent save files will be copied into this folder, saving the newest data for the last five consecutive days you've played the game. This is just an additional backup, as long as nothing breaks, you don't need to worry about this folder, but you can use the files to restore your progress if needed!<br/>
<p><strong>Local Backups</strong></p>
<p>Before this update, every file was saved in the Steam Cloud, now we're also creating local backups. You don't need to worry about these, it's just an additional safety net. If somehow Steam Cloud messes with your files, you can copy your local files into the proper folder manually and restore what Steam destroyed!<br/>
<br/>
All of these features should help prevent broken or corrupted save files, create regular safety backups, and allow you to manually restore your files in case your computer crashes or Steam Cloud is messing with your files.<br/>
<br/>
Please note, that many people (players and developers alike) have problems with the Steam Cloud sometimes not properly syncing files between different computers. We tried our best to create the best possible backup system for you guys!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very much looking forward to another attempt to beat it soon. Really good fun.</p>

      <title>Awesome free retro RPG Moonring gets another big update - looking good on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonring originally released back in 2023 from the co-creator of the Xbox's Fable series, it's free, has a lot of good reviews and now it should be even better for all players. The developer has steadily continued to upgrade the game since release, with this being "build 900".</p>
<p>More about it: "Moonring is a retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games, but created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities. The world's geography is hand-designed, but the deadly dungeons beneath the surface reconfigure each time you leave... or die. Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera. Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!"</p>
<p>If you love your classics but appreciate the modern touches, this is definitely one for you. It works well on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified on Steam. There's also a Linux version on the itch.io page (but not Steam).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/183819801738146799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/183819801738146799gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Moonring on Desktop Linux</em></p>
<p>In the latest update the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to build 900. Yes, really. So much has changed since last year.<br/>
<br/>
I've held off doing this for the longest time because there are a LOT of you out there, and I didn't want to deal with a huge influx of issues at one time. This way, I've tested the game out on a smaller (more insane) audience and annoyed them instead of all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Those on the experimental branch will be well aware of this, but the rest of you are in for a big surprise. Well, several actually.<br/>
<br/>
- the UI has had a complete overhaul<br/>
- the dungeon generator was thrown away and started again from scratch<br/>
- there are lots of new dungeon features, too<br/>
- minor ruins are now far more interesting<br/>
- the Traders have been replaced with far more varied Events (which also include traders)<br/>
- the map is way more helpful<br/>
- the balance of the game is a little more challenging, with way fewer exploits<br/>
- armour makes more sense<br/>
- the Steamdeck version is actually really nice<br/>
<br/>
...and so much more.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think the game has never been better, more stable, or more of a retro ego-stroking exerc... I mean goose-filled nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it on Steam Deck today and it's looking really good there. The Steam page doesn't say so but it <em>does</em> have full controller support with the correct icons and all.</p>

      <title>System76 Meerkat Mini PC gets a nice upgrade with Intel Core Ultra</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor and Pop!_OS Linux distribution developer System76 have revealed the brand new upgraded Meerkat Mini PC. This new fancy refresh gives you up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor with Intel ARC graphics.</p>
<p>This new refresh also brings with it System76 Open Firmware that they say brings "fast boot times and tighter security" powered by coreboot. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the mini Meerkat only occupies a 4.5-inch square of desk space, it can also occupy zero. Dorm dwellers, Clutter Clydes, and Neat Nathans can use a VESA mount to hide the Meerkat behind their monitor, saving precious space to gain the upper hand against the forces of messiness.</p>

      <title>The new trailer for sandbox strategy game Antimatter shows off the epic scale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in 2020 the strategy game Antimatter sure looked exciting during the Kickstarter, with the developer steadily building up all the promised features.</p>
<p>To begin 2025, they've put up a new showcase trailer of various bits done on the game during 2024. The trailer really helps to show off the immense scale of it. The kind of mega scale you don't see many games try and it does look like it will be quite an interesting one to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AZ1HwH0pp2c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c90ae6f72a9f93e55c852b6ff445015b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AZ1HwH0pp2c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit shared in the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1343010/view/508444538590725207" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on Steam, that some players might frown upon, is that they're using the "GPT API" to translate the game into various languages. As they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have initiated localization of the game and about 1500 string keys are bound already. I am glad to say that the game and all mods will be very easy to translate (a single file).<br/>
I speak French and can muddle through a bit of English, so both languages are included as core languages.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the languages, I wrote a program that automatically translates the game through the GPT API by incorporating already translated languages and context. The more core languages, the better the generated translations will be. I am confident that after some training, most languages will have a proper translation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps they will earn enough from it to get real translations done by people who actually understand context and the languages properly.</p>
<p>They're not giving an update on when it will release but in a previous update said "All I can say is that the game, the software, is in excellent technical shape, and I am very optimistic".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A procedurally generated and dynamic universe with thousands of systems to explore, where dozens of factions struggle for power or survival.</li>
<li>Take command of a spaceship, trade, mine, harvest, scavenge, produce, and participate in the simulated economy.</li>
<li>Manage an existing city or found new colonies and outposts on any planet.</li>
<li>Climb the political ladder of a commercial or sovereign organization.</li>
<li>Interact with AI characters who are living independent and simulated life in the Antimatter universe.</li>
<li>Terraform entire planets by altering their atmospheric compositions.</li>
<li>Fulfil missions for corporations, factions, or individuals, or unravel the secrets of this galaxy.</li>
<li>Get involved in the Antimatter Crisis and try to change the course of history.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Survival horror Chernobylite updated for better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While working on Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, developer The Farm 51 have gone back and further enhanced Chernobylite Complete Edition to bring some Steam Deck improvements.</p>
<p>What is it? According to the dev: "Chernobylite is a science-fiction survival horror RPG. Set in the hyper-realistic, 3D-scanned wasteland of Chernobyl’s Exclusion Zone, explore a non-linear storyline in your search to uncover the truth of your tortured past."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fobhrngLLk0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1da29ce629b4be3e3c0c251d105ae77b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fobhrngLLk0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1016800/announcements/detail/532087167537644004" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> was released on January 21st that I spotted today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Default Config Performance optimized for Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Text Legibility - some texts increased in size and the whole UI upscaled by 20% to provide better readability of texts.</li>
<li>External Controller support so that the game does not have to be restarted after attaching other controller</li>
<li>Default Sound Device change to better suit the needs of the device.</li>
<li>Some options excluded from Steam Deck like changing fullscreen/windowed mode to avoid problems with video.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a few other developers, it's hiding things on Steam Deck that isn't usually going to be used. You should however be able to override their Steam Deck detection (for whatever reason) using <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code> as a launch option if they're doing it the same as other developers.</p>
<p>Perhaps this update will see the game get bumped up from Playable to Verified.</p>

      <title>Popular rogue-lite space shooter Nova Drift gets updated for Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nova Drift from developer Chimeric is a very well-received rogue-lite space shooter that released back in 2024, and the dev continues working on it. The latest update includes some changes to improve it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Nova Drift is a 'rogue-lite' space shooter that melds a classic arcade experience with modern action-RPG elements, emphasizing build-crafting and deep customization. Your ship rapidly evolves as you defeat enemies, allowing you to take a build from inception to execution in a single, captivating game session.</p>
<p>Build to play how you want, creating a unique build every game. Runs are quick, allowing for rapid experimentation and iteration."</p>
<p>From the update titled "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/858210/announcements/detail/501689139151766646" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck Hotfix - V. 1.1.12</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Made a few changes to comply with Steam Deck verification requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed non-value settings items getting greyed out incorrectly on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed Window Size setting being selectable on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed loading and saving settings that are disabled on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed Custom Skin sprite overlapping the score on the End Score screen</li>
<li>Upgrade screen descriptions now use the standard-scaling small font to comply with Steam Deck text size requirements</li>
<li>We now hide key indicators in construct UI when using gamepad controls</li>
<li>We now don't grey out the Online Leaderboard setting item on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed line wrapping length in end game unlock messages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Wild West point &amp; click adventure Rosewater set for release in March with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>More about it: "It's been several years since Harley Leger left New Bretagne and headed west, hoping to leave the past behind and make her way as a freelance writer. After arriving in the sleepy border town of Rosewater, a seemingly trivial assignment for the local paper leads to the hunt for a missing man's fortune—and the story of the century.</p>
<p>Harley and her ragtag posse embark on a harrowing journey across Western Vespuccia, encountering bandits, rebels, visionaries, eccentrics, and many more friends and foes on their quest for fame and riches."</p>

      <title>The latest Two Point Museum trailer shows off Museum Management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing with Linux support on March 4, Two Point Museum has a brand new trailer to showcase Museum Management and more.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two Point Museum takes players into a realm where art meets antics, and exhibits collide with occasionally questionable management choices. To ensure aspiring curators are well equipped to run their own museum empire when Two Point Museum launches on March 4th, 2025, this video gives an overview of all the intricacies and foibles of management.</p>
<p>Running a museum is a balancing act of epic proportions. Money comes from ticket sales, donations, and the perfectly reasonable prices at the gift shop. But beware – arranging expeditions, marketing, workshops, decorations, training, and all those other pesky expenses could put you in the red. Fortunately, loans and sponsorships are always available as backup, though they come with their own risks.</p>
<p>A major component of any curator's management duties is overseeing their staff. They are the backbone of any museum… and occasionally its biggest headache. Experts analyse and maintain exhibits, janitors handle messes and workshop builds, assistants manage ticket booths, gift shops and expeditions while security protects exhibits, donations and the peace. Skilled staff come at a price, so museum managers must keep those pay checks flowing or risk facing their wrath. So, who’s up for the challenge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>

<p>While it releases for everyone on March 4th, they also have Advanced Access starting on February 27th if you buy the more expensive Explorer Edition.</p>

      <title>Dying Light is getting a free graphical update, plus Dying Light 2 will get a new game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are celebrating 10 years of Dying Light with a number of announcements, like a graphics update to the original, a few events and some big discounts.</p>
<p>For Dying Light they said: "Even after 10 years we are working on a new update for the game. It still looks great but we wanted to squeeze a little bit more out of it. Free for all Dying Light owners, the 10th anniversary update will increase the visual quality and will feature a remastered soundtrack."</p>
<p>They didn't give a date on when other than "very soon".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2723018691738057848gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Dying Light</em></p>
<p>Both games have big discounts right now, with Dying Light 2 having its biggest discount so far since release.</p>
<p>Dying Light also has a few in-game events over the next few weeks, along with a free time-limited DLC you can claim on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454290/Dying_Light__10th_Anniversary_Bundle/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Dying Light 2 also has some special in-game rewards you can get, and a new Tower Raid permanent rogue-lite mode will be added to the game with a fresh update sometime in late February.</p>

      <title>Steam / Steam Deck Beta update will no longer bug friends in-game when you reconnect</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another smaller Steam Client Beta update for Desktop / Steam Deck, with a little tweak for in-game notifications amongst some other bug fixes.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/523081237389116486?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> is the same across Steam Desktop and Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When reconnecting to Steam (including when resuming from suspend), in game notifications will no longer appear for friends currently in a game.</li>
<li>Fixed the Backup Game Files dialog sometimes failing to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Big Picture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error when receiving a voice chat invite.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed L3/R3 buttons not working on fightsticks or other devices that don't have left/right stick analog axes</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This client update was re-released to fix a regression when opening the standlone on-screen keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A useful tweak to the notifications, since they could end up a bit spammy once you have quite a few friends. If some were having issues, it could end up filling up your notifications. If you even have them turned on that is.</p>

      <title>NTSYNC for Proton / Wine now in Linux kernel 6.14 that &#34;Should make many SteamOS users happy&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like the upcoming Linux kernel 6.14 release is going to be a nice one for gamers on Linux / Steam Deck, as the NTSYNC code has now been properly merged in ready.</p>
<p>Developer Greg Kroah-Hartman sent in the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Z5fJmQlVQmnnqAC4@kroah.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">request</a>, which was then <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=13845bdc869f136f92ad3d40ea09b867bb4ce467" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">accepted</a> by Linus Torvalds. Amongst other things it includes the completed and enabled NTSYNC driver. As a refresher: Proton already has the likes of Esync and Fsync, which are ways to match certain behaviour expected by Windows games. This new NTSYNC driver directly in the Linux kernel should be more accurate and give better compatibility overall.</p>
<p>For plain Wine there's a big performance benefit, but for Valve's Proton it will mostly be around the same. However, we may see some better compatibility in certain games. The performance difference versus plain Wine that were <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241213193511.457338-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shown off before</a> across different systems:</p>

      <title>Iron Roads is a cute-looking rail network optimisation sim out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your building and management sims? Iron Roads puts a rather cute looking style on it and it's now available with Linux support in Early Access. Developed by Cowleyfornia Studios, who also made the narrative games We'll always have Paris and Sarawak.</p>
<p>More about it: Iron Roads is a top-down 2D train management game with a focus on optimising train networks. With a minimalistic interface that stays out of your way while you set up complex networks, while remaining approachable for new players. They said they're aiming for the accessibility of Mini Metro and the depth of games such as OpenTTD and Opus Magnum, while also capturing the irreverent tone of games like the Two Point series and Let's Build a Zoo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_63znauDUD8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b9b91cafc6867b3476798e829e3c8a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_63znauDUD8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board game like mechanics</strong> For example, Iron Roads has resource tokens rather than money. These can be earned by growing towns or completing contracts, and need to be used strategically to expand networks and progress the game.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural music</strong> Music in Iron Roads is a combination of notes generated from trains and passengers, and authored melodies. The music generated is as unique as the layouts built by players.</li>
<li><strong>Performance graphs</strong> The main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise the train networks, so charts are available to analyse data relating to finances and passengers.</li>
<li><strong>3 Game modes</strong> Scenarios are hand crafted levels with unique gameplay elements; in the time-based challenges you must transport as many passengers as possible in a fixed period of time; there is also a free play mode where you can build your network and transport passengers free of any constraints.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer previously mentioned to me how a lot of it was developed on Linux too. Their roadmap also includes controller support and proper Steam Deck support coming later.</p>

<p>What a great time for PC gamers. Consoles are seeing less exclusives. Although the titles still take a while to come onto PC, we're getting a steady flow of them now. And thanks to Valve's Proton, it should hopefully run well on Linux platforms.</p>

      <title>AMPLITUDE announce ENDLESS Legend 2 with publishing from Hooded Horse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMPLITUDE Studios have announced ENDLESS Legend 2 and teamed up with Hooded Horse, who are quickly becoming known for publishing some great strategy games. It looks gorgeous too.</p>
<p>Back in November 2024, AMPLITUDE Studios <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-space-2/blogs/953-returning-to-our-roots" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a break from SEGA going back to being an independent studio, with ownership of the studio going back to some of the original founders. Hopefully their teaming up with Hooded Horse for this new game will go well.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dive into Saiadha, a breathtaking yet perilous oceanic world where ever-changing seasons and monstrous tidefalls dramatically transform the landscape. As the water goes down, the environment itself becomes both an obstacle and a chance for discovery. Players will have to adapt to these constant shifts, confront ancient threats, and uncover the secrets buried deep within Saiadha. Each cataclysm brings new dangers but also unique opportunities."</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d6CrUefP7UE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd004deed97e2fa9c1ca50c8ad1c83e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d6CrUefP7UE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Amplitude has been making world-class strategy games for over a decade,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender, “We’re honored to be part of their next game.”</p>
<p>The first game works well on Linux with Proton, I expect this new one to run just as well.</p>

      <title>Mahjong gets the Balatro treatment with Aotenjo: Infinite Hands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're likely to continue seeing more developers try mixing up classic games like Balatro did with Poker, and now we have Aotenjo: Infinite Hands aiming to do similar for Mahjong. It's already proving quite popular with a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Here the ancient Chinese game of Mahjong meets deck-building. And of course, you get to make it ridiculous with special Artifacts to change the game along with various special Tiles and Gadgets. The developer said: "Inspired by over 40 different regional Mahjong styles, Aotenjo offers a blend of familiarity and novelty. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned player of Richii, MCR, or Cantonese Mahjong, you’ll find something to enjoy. From Two-Suit Only challenges to Dora and Flower Tiles, we have it all!".</p>
<p>Official trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UGrEnu1TaLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c7df58e257da1dc2ea7ce180ed11ff1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UGrEnu1TaLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Artifact Mastery: Unlock and utilize 144 unique Artifacts.</li>
<li>Pattern Variety: Explore and activate 100 different Patterns.</li>
<li>Dynamic Gameplay: Experience ever-changing levels with seeded generation.</li>
<li>Different Mahjongs: Enjoy elements from over 40 regional Mahjong styles.</li>
<li>Strategic Depth: Design your strategies and combine all of your Patterns, Tiles, Artifacts and Gadgets to overcome powerful innate threats.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>
<p>I'm loving the return of so many of these smaller games each providing some new spin on a classic. </p>

      <title>Chaosmonger Studio have announced a new adventure game with MIGHTY 1990</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MIGHTY 1990 is the next game from Chaosmonger Studio who have been pumping out releases over the last few years including ENCODYA, Speedollama, Three Minutes To Eight and Clunky Hero.</p>
<p>What is it? This retro-inspired adventure game, combines the charm of text-based adventures with point-and-click puzzle mechanics, RPG-inspired features, and a humour-filled narrative. No release date or trailer has been provided on it yet just some early screenshots and a now-live Steam page.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16456356921737985725gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16456356921737985725gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5843684471737985726gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5843684471737985726gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retro Gameplay Mechanics</strong>: The entire game can be played using only the keyboard—just like the first text-based adventures—ensuring fast, focused gameplay without the distractions of pixel hunting. However, players can also use the mouse to interact with the streamlined lower interface, which houses all the necessary commands.</li>
<li><strong>Skill-Based Challenges</strong>: Choose your class, develop skills, and influence outcomes by rolling dice. Whether using charisma to win over an NPC or solving puzzles creatively, every playthrough feels fresh and unique.</li>
<li><strong>Branching Endings</strong>: Your decisions, class, and skills dynamically shape the narrative, leading to a variety of satisfying—or hilariously tragic—conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Monochromatic Blueish Palette</strong>: A visually stunning 16-color design inspired by MS-DOS games and the hardware limitations of the 386/486 era, blending retro aesthetics with a unique artistic twist.</li>
<li><strong>Humorous Nostalgia</strong>: Packed with quirky dialogue and nods to the golden age of gaming, <strong>MIGHTY 1990</strong> will keep players laughing while they save the world.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nicola Piovesan, CEO of Chaosmonger Studio, said: "MIGHTY 1990 bridges two iconic eras of gaming: the text-based adventures of the early PC gaming years and the point-and-click classics of the early '90s. It’s a gameplay hybrid that feels like the missing link in gaming history. All actions are mapped to a keyboard for seamless interaction, emulating the fast-paced flow of classic adventures, while still allowing players to explore at their own rhythm. Its 16-color monochromatic blueish palette and gameplay style evoke the era of 386 and 486 processors, delivering a truly authentic retro experience."</p>

      <title>The ridiculous Steam Brick just makes me want a proper Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One modder took it upon themselves to turn their Steam Deck into a Steam Brick, a tiny little console that makes me really want a proper Steam Machine.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, the original Steam Machine things failed, but since then Valve have learned a lot. Proton exists now and runs tens of thousands of Windows games, plus the Steam Deck has clearly been a success. With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expansion of SteamOS for more devices</a>, I think it's about time. Valve need to get Steam into the living room properly again. Until then, people are going to do crazy things like the Steam Brick.</p>
<p>Created by crastinator-pro and written up in a blog post, it details how they tore apart a Steam Deck to stick it into a fancy little screenless box. Why? Well "the Steam Deck didn’t fit in my backpack" they said and also "Because I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could that I didn’t stop to think if I should".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4192515891737984910gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This type of hardware modding is obviously a niche thing, and not something I'm going to suggest anyone do. A lot could go wrong and you end up with totally broken hardware. But for this modder they said most of their time was spend either plugged into a TV or using AR Glasses so it seemed to make sense. Even they said "This project was not approved or endorsed in any way by Valve and is generally a very bad idea".</p>
<p>All of this was possible since Valve made the device easily repairable, with the modder noting the help of the various iFixIt guides and they used the OLED Steam Deck for this little project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16802888051737985105gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The creator notes the casing is "Overture Polycarbonate Pro (PC) which should be heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run Cyberpunk 2077".</p>
<p>See <a href="https://crastinator-pro.github.io/steam-brick/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their full post</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>War Thunder gets BattlEye anti-cheat enabled for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder from Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/war-thunder-is-moving-away-from-easy-anti-cheat-to-battleye/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in December 2024</a> that they would be changing the anti-cheat, which continues to be rolled out in stages. They're moving from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye, both of which support Linux platforms and War Thunder did <em>already</em> support Linux.</p>
<p>As of the latest update posted January 24th, they noted "BattlEye anti-cheat has been enabled for Linux", so players on Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck should be good to <em>continue</em> playing. The update is noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1425749491737807547gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - War Thunder</em></p>
<p>It's great to see Gaijin Entertainment have kept up their Linux support for this game for so long. Showing many others how it can be done successfully, unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a>, which also uses BattlEye but Rockstar are choosing not to enable it.</p>
<p>War Thunder remains wildly popular too with a 24 hour peak of 87,363 players, and that's just on Steam, the game is available direct from the developer and on consoles.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I added AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation and Super Resolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those interested in maximising game performance on Linux / Steam Deck, The Last of Us Part I just got another major tech upgrade. v1.1.4 released January 24th, further enhancing the graphical options available.</p>
<p>Patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feature Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Super Resolution</li>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[Hometown] Fixed rendering issue that could appear on TVs when using NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR</li>
<li>[The University] Fixed issue that could occur when interacting with a generator while enemies were still present</li>
<li>[Bus Depot] Fixed issue where Joel's flashlight would turn on when inspecting certain artifacts despite being in direct sunlight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Text to Speech issue where "M" key was not being read when assigned to a function</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it might make the experience even better on Steam Deck, depending on your settings. As we've seen before, unless the game is already performing somewhat well, Frame Generation can seriously mess with the frame timings.</p>

      <title>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a perfect time-killer where you can make some ridiculous ships</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a steampunk themed auto-shooter just released from David Stark, an offshoot of their other game Airships: Conquer the Skies and it's simply great. <em>Disclosure: the publisher Metaroot sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Vampire Survivors, Brotato and all the others that have come along that in some way fit into this bullet heaven genre, you probably already know a lot of what to expect from a game like this. You go through waves of enemies against a timer, trying to survive to make it to the next wave, so you can upgrade and keep pushing further.</p>
<p>Here you're piloting a steampunk airship of some sort, and gradually adding more weapons and buffs to make the most ridiculous build you possibly can. Like a ship that has a cannon, a giant saw blade and…tentacles (because why the hell not it looks cool!).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6214210641737738706gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When you manage to complete a wave, you then get to go through various ship upgrades. This could be entirely new weapons, ability buffs you can repeatedly train, weapon level upgrades and other modules to install. There's quite a <em>lot</em> to pick from, and you really can make some varied builds once you start unlocking more ships that have more space on them. Bigger isn't always better though. The smaller ships are speedy, while the bigger ships are sluggish and quite challenging to play as.</p>
<p>Trying out all the hundreds of different combinations has been exceptionally fun, the key to this game really is the variety in all the builds to keep trying something new.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15789400431737740546gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Weapons having two different upgrade paths for each of them is a nice touch too. So even if you pick the same weapons one run, you could upgrade them an entirely different way in another run.</p>
<p>After going through the upgrades, it's time to pick a path across the map. This part is what I really like about the game, because it makes you think and try to plan a little. Each location offers up something different in terms of risk versus reward. You might want to pick an easy path just to get further, or risk it for more research and different types of rewards available to progress in other ways.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GIPgpacnFQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c68bc0720c9f9f856a815ebd3a064c14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GIPgpacnFQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once you get further in, the game opens up a little more too with all the different types of enemies with their various weapons and attack patterns. Then add to that there's some environmental interactions too like clouds that can help reduce fire but also visibility, sandstorms that push you around and more.</p>
<p>The boss battles can be pretty insane too, and thoroughly challenging. The game as a whole is pretty challenging though, although I've been playing it on the middle difficulty which does feel about right.</p>
<p>Quite accessible too since not only does your ship auto-fire but you can make it so it powers forwards by itself, with you only needing to control left and right. Easy one-handed gaming.</p>
<p>While it's not much to look at, with some truly basic artwork for a lot of it, Airships: Lost Flotilla is a perfect time-killer for when you've got a few minutes spare but it can easily sink your entire evening.</p>
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

No static board here, you get to explore the galaxy while building up words on an empty grid. It's a really interesting spin on the genre and it just released with Linux support.</p>
<p>Check out the new release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OkuZ7wAqt3Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9920223564225d468f613f12eeb56db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OkuZ7wAqt3Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by PUNKCAKE Delicieux who also made quite a few other smaller games and they all look really interesting like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1972440/Shotgun_King_The_Final_Checkmate/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521550/Shroomchitect/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shroomchitect</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2832620/Stray_Shot/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stray Shot</a> and more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about Horizons: The End Of Words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explore outer space with your word-finding skills.</p>
<p>You are dealt a handful of letters and must make words on an empty grid. Letters replenish with oxygen after you use them, and so you have to make new words, to find new oxygen. The grid might not be empty anymore but don't fret, it is as boundless as the universe itself. Oxygen on the other hand...</p>
<p>In Mission mode, set your own difficulty with 28 unique modifiers and try to beat the game by mining up resources.</p>
<p>In Journey mode, set out to explore the galaxy. Stop at various space stations to acquire and upgrade items to help you along on your wordy journey. Stretch your web of words as far as possible and discover as many planets as you can.</p>
<p>Plays entirely with the mouse. A run may last for a couple of hours. Features a save system.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform Nexus Mods App v0.7.2 improves the UI, adds Bannerlord Software Extender support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus team continue building up their newer cross-platform open source Nexus Mods App that will eventually replace Vortex. Version 0.7.2 was released recently further expanding what you can do with it.</p>
<p>With this update the UI has seen some further refinements like the Games, Loadouts, and Health Check pages to bring them up to date along with a bunch of new icons. They've also made improvements to how they handle File Conflicts. For players of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, they've added in support for the Bannerlord Software Extender.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15109160921737722879gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Other changes and known issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free users will now see a modal prompting them to upgrade to Premium when clicking the "Download all" buttons for Collections. Downloading mods individually is still possible.</li>
<li>When a loadout is removed, the associated Workspace data is now cleaned up.</li>
<li>Reduced the number of log messages to make troubleshooting issues easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections is not showing the correct value.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>

      <title>Games to claim from Prime Gaming, Jan 24 edition round-up for SteamOS Linux and Steam Deck</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for January 24th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Palworld gets a roadmap including co-op crossplay, world transfers for Pals and an ending</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair have recently revealed a fresh roadmap of what's to come for the popular monster catching survival game. There's still no update yet on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo and Pokemon lawsuit</a>, hopefully we'll see a resolution to that sometime soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/109465341737717092gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">To celebrate the first anniversary they've revealed their upcoming plans which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO-OP Crossplay.</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals.</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario.</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals.</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies.</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria).</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement.</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals.</li>
<li>Improvements to optimization.</li>
<li>Improvements to UX.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed it the developer also recently launched <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocketpair Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Palworld works on Linux Desktop with Proton, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable (it has a lot of issues). Would be nice if Pocketpair would also work on improving how it runs on Steam Deck where it would be a really good fit if they put some effort into it.</p>
<p>It's continued to see a lot of players since the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/palworld-feybreak-v0411-is-out-now-and-its-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feybreak update</a> with it seeing a 24 hour peak player count of 96,808.</p>

      <title>Base-building survival game Necesse gets a big update and Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necesse is an impressive open-world base-building survival and adventure game from developer Fair Games ApS, with a big update out now and you can try it free this weekend. There's also a 35% discount if you want to keep it.</p>
<p>The game has full Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. So if you've been stuck for something to play, this could be a great pick for you to game away your weekend.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0n5zR0_sW40"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89f4d98a040be6946962230d6cb1aa74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0n5zR0_sW40" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about the update the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I talked about in the last update, we've focused more on making the progression and exploration less repetitive. This time around we’ve added new hazards to the snow, swamp and desert caves. The Deep caves will receive a similar treatment in a future update.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the Free Weekend and co-op play, we’ve also added 4 new staves that specialize in buffing your allies. But if you prefer to play solo, you can also give them to your settlers. If you enjoy playing a supportive playstyle, then these staves are for you!</p>
<p>And other smaller changes, like a new critter when exploring the caves along with a new crop and some food. This will make it harder to run out of food while deep in the caves :)</p>
<p>Some of the other features in this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hoverboard now better handling and a dash ability!</li>
<li>Several gravel tiles that couldn't be crafted before, are now craftable.</li>
<li>More gems will now drop from the crystal mini biomes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches May 15 with a new trailer and developer video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>id Software and Bethesda Softworks have revealed more gameplay for DOOM: The Dark Ages, plus it's now set for release on May 15th. Although, like many bigger developers, you can get it a few days early if you buy the more expensive edition of the game for Advanced Access on May 13th.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8KyA7bf4IB0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c532b0b356f87d7f21071f1be93d32e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8KyA7bf4IB0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want a longer look at the game they also have a developer video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FGFuaVUI6_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6555745d418def9a90f2c57e76811db3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FGFuaVUI6_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Something to note, is that the game <em>requires</em> a GPU with Ray Tracing capabilities, even on their minimum settings. As they announced in a <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-EU/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they said: "Note: DOOM: The Dark Ages requires a hardware ray tracing-compatible GPU to play on PC, including Minimum Specifications. Details on Path Tracing specifications will be revealed at a later date."</p>
<p>They say it's using a new generation of their idTech game engine, idTech8, which takes "full advantage of modern hardware on all platforms, idTech8 ushers in a new era of gameplay performance and visual fidelity featuring all-new dynamic interactive ray-traced lighting and shadows, higher-fidelity image quality, increased gore and destruction and so much more".</p>
<p>Sounds quite exciting, if your PC will run it, as it has the "largest environments ever in a DOOM game" to date with dragons and great big mechs. This might be a bridge too far for the Steam Deck though. Hopefully there won't be any issues with normal Desktop Linux via Proton.</p>
<p>Here's the specifications they've given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>MINIMUM (1080p/60 FPS/Low Video Settings)</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Zen 2 or Intel 10th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or better, Intel Core i7 10700K or better)</p>

<p><strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</p>
<p><strong><u>RECOMMENDED (1440p/60 FPS/High Video Settings)</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>OS: </strong>Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or better, Intel Core i7 12700K or better)</p>
<p><strong>GPU: </strong>NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 16GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or better, AMD RX 7900XT or better)</p>
<p><strong>System RAM: </strong>32GB</p>
<p><strong>Storage Capacity: </strong>512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH broken on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs but works with AMD GPUs like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sad news for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux who want to play FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH, which just released on Steam yesterday as it appears broken. Works on Linux for those with an AMD GPU like the Steam Deck though.</p>
<p>According to the developer of VKD3D-Proton, the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used by Proton, this is an NVIDIA driver bug that has been reported to NVIDIA already. As developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen said on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2610069931" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RTX issues are known. It's a driver bug and it has been reported to NV with bug number 5059946.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out a reasonable workaround, but to no avail.</p>

<p>NVIDIA do have a new 570 Linux driver coming soon to support the new GeForce RTX 50 series, which should be coming on January 30th. However, some have spotted an early build of the 570 driver and tested it and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2611708530" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that it does not fix it (but it's not clear if that's a complete driver).</p>
<p>The good news for everyone else, is that it does work with an AMD GPU (including the Steam Deck with SteamOS). However, if you're on a SteamOS-like distribution, you might need to tell the game you're not on a Steam Deck, otherwise it will give you low visuals. Set this launch option:</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to get THE FINALS working again on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recent updates to THE FINALS ended up breaking it on Linux / Steam Deck, but Valve have pushed out a new update to Proton Hotfix to get it working again.</p>
<p>Lots of reports came flowing into <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2073850" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> about it being broken, and on Valve's GitHub too where yesterday a Proton developer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-2608576332" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> Proton Experimental's Beta version got a fix that should help (with reports showing it did). So now Valve have updated Proton Hotfix and set it as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=27141418" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">default</a> for THE FINALS. So you shouldn't need to do anything, except untick any Proton version you may have forced on it previously.</p>
<p>Testing it myself today on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) and yup, all working just fine again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3202100991737714020gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3202100991737714020gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Unlike normal Proton version and Proton Experimental, Valve don't generally announce changes for Proton Hotfix since it's not used too often and only in certain special cases like this where they're not ready to update the other main Proton versions. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in my guide on all the Proton versions</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with fixes for Battle.net, Atelier Resleriana, Dirt Rally 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve updated Proton Experimental for January 22nd with a bunch more fixes for gamers on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck. Like the Battle.net update issue that came up recently that was fixed in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ge-proton-9-23-released-with-a-battlenet-fix-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent GE-Proton update</a> too. <em>Confused on all the Proton versions?

<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as now playable with this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition Demo.</li>
<li>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed non-Steam battle.net installations.</li>
<li>Fixed desync issue with 60FPS AVPro videos in VRChat.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed Proton 9 regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed performance degradation in Dirt Rally 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to fix issues with apps people add into Steam like Battle.net, since you can install various third-party standalone stuff using Proton too.</p>

      <title>GDC 2025 survey shows PC game development growing with lots interested in Valve&#39;s Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Game Developers Conference (GDC) survey has been released, and it gives a rather glowing overview of how great things are for PC gamers with lots of developers working on games.</p>
<p>With the survey including over 3,000 game developers and industry professionals, they've managed a decent enough sample size. What's really interesting though, is that PC game development is not just alive and well but expanding. As they said last year only "66% of developers reported that they were working on games for PC", but this year "that number climbed up to 80%".</p>
<p>Another interesting point here is that while the Steam Deck was <em>not</em> listed as an option, of those who picked "Other", the survey saw "44% of them wrote in Steam Deck as a platform they’re interested in". <em>They didn't state how many filled out Other though.</em></p>

<p><em>PC in this case means Windows specifically since Mac and Linux are separated. The industry still generally writes PC as meaning Windows. Maybe one day we'll break away from it. <strong>Update 8PM UTC</strong>: Image updated to their newer corrected version for some text.</em></p>
<p>Developers still don't seem all that keen on AI as well with "30% of respondents reported that they believe that generative AI is having a negative impact on the games industry, which is a 12% increase from last year". However, there's plenty that are using AI as GDC note: "More than half of developers surveyed (52%) work for companies that have implemented generative AI and one-third (36%) personally use them. Respondents within Business and Finance Roles in companies were most likely to use Artificial intelligence tools (51%), followed by Production and Team Leadership (41%) and Community, Marketing and PR (39%)".</p>
<p>Layoffs continue to hit hard too with "11% of developers reported being laid off in the past year".</p>
<p>Going by the results 4% of developers are using the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> for their current game, with the majority currently sticking to Unity and Unreal both at at 32%. 13% said they use other proprietary tools and then there's CryEngine at 0.2% and O3DE at 0.1%.</p>

      <title>over the hill is an offroading exploration game announced by the art of rally devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The devs of art of rally, Funselektor Labs along with Strelka Games have announced over the hill, a new offroading exploration sim where you can bring a friend along for the ride.</p>
<p>With graphics quite similar to art of rally, they're not going for realism but sticking with the colourful style they're known for and I think it looks wonderful. They're continuing the nostalgia trip too with it focusing on the "golden age of offroading" they say that gives you access to "iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s".</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hFi39URiesI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e7868c0e97a883b9d6eb917fcc0aa0b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hFi39URiesI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a world of discovery - Discover portals to travel to new areas, and complete objectives to unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customizations, and cosmetics, with many combinations to try. Who knows, maybe you’ll find some hidden gems along the way.</li>
<li>multi or single player - Take a friend or go on a solo tour. Challenge yourself, collaborate with up to three friends, or just enjoy the sights - the world is your oyster.</li>
<li>adapt and overcome - Take on the elements with dynamic weather, day/night cycles, and realistic terrain deformation. Find solace in nature, even when you’re stuck in the mud.</li>
<li>Fancy a break? Gather your friends around the campfire, grab a hot cocoa, and catch up on the day’s events.</li>
<li>it’s about the journey - The best stories never start at the end. With so much to explore and uncover, it’s all about the cruise. Complete all the objectives, unlock the many customizations and upgrades, and discover everything the wilderness has to offer. Just take your time and find peace in the minimalistic serenity.</li>
<li>capture the beauty - Grab stills of your favourite landscapes with the built-in photo mode. We can’t wait to follow your journey. You never know what you may discover just over the hill.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems you'll probably need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>
<p>This one is going right into my wishlist.</p>

      <title>Linux &#39;fascinates and terrifies&#39; the dev of DEAD LETTER DEPT. but they&#39;re supporting it anyway</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mike Monroe / Belief Engine are approaching the release of DEAD LETTER DEPT., a thoroughly creeping looking typing game and it's coming with Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer emailed over a pre-release key for the game.</em></p>
<p>What is it? An unusual typing game that revolves around you taking a temp job while you get situated in a new city, being tasked with the data-entry work of typing up various words and addresses written on the mail &amp; letters that were not able to be successfully delivered- due to bad handwriting or other reasons unknown. As the days pass on, strange stories begin to emerge from the mail you review. Sometimes it feels like they're talking directly to you.</p>
<p>The developer summed it up as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In terms of game mechanic themes, you could say DEAD LETTER DEPT. is relative to other horror games like Home Safety Hotline and The Mortuary Assistant, in which you are tasked with a job to accomplish but with rising complications as the story and tensions progress. Details lie under the surface, for those willing to look.</li>
<li>Horror wise, it is a technological ghost story with the focus being on building mood, dread, atmosphere, and the fear of the unknown.  There is certain programming in DEAD LETTER DEPT. that I specifically kept unpredictable for certain occasions, as I wanted the game to feel haunted even during it's own development.</li>
<li>The mail in each playthrough is intelligently randomized, meaning no two playthroughs are quite the same. A typical playthrough can run around 2 hours, with multiple endings to encounter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sIyIh7-1P7o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45c47f77b03210e004ac4e91f174efca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sIyIh7-1P7o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about the Linux / SteamOS support for the game in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627350/view/693091765959262378" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a long story really. What began as a casual investigation into making sure the game functionally runs on Steam Deck, turned into: 'Oh, the game appears to run surprisingly well on Linux???' Frankly I anticipated random filesystem explosions and graphical razorblades to have to solve for this, like with any port. But nope? It's been tested on 4 different distros (Zorin, Arch, Ubuntu, and the SteamOS of course) and appears to run pretty identical to its Windows counterpart. So I think that's cautiously optimistic enough results to try.</p>
<p>Frankly making a Linux version automatically solves a MASSIVE GAMEBREAKING VIDEO CODEC issue if the game would be run under Proton (on the Steam Deck), so I might as just publish a Linux version.</p>
<p>I realize the Linux user demand for this game isn't necessarily huge (to be fair I haven't listed it as Linux supported yet either), but I'm willing to give it a fair shot. Linux fascinates and terrifies.</p>

      <title>Adventures of a Cat in Space is an upcoming musical adventure starring Arthur Darvill</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Adventures of a Cat in Space sounds like an exciting one to keep on your radar. An upcoming musical point and click adventure game starring Arthur Darvill (Doctor Who, Broadchurch, Legends of Tomorrow and more).</p>
<p>Commissioned by <a href="https://www.thespace.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Space</a>, Adventures Of A Cat In Space is a collaboration between family music specialists Little Seeds Music, and narrative game developers Tall Story Games (Heir of the Dog, Lucy Dreaming). Players take on the role of a cat stranded in space after an unexpected mishap. To make their way back to Earth, they must explore a vast and colourful array of planets, solve puzzles, and unlock songs that will help guide them home. They are aided in their quest by the ship’s computer, voiced by Olivier award winning actor and musician Arthur Darvill, who also performs the game's main theme song. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LX9fJXmz6wI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97aa2d49410f58107228c6d505833c33.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LX9fJXmz6wI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: Adventures Of A Cat In Space has been commissioned and funded by The Space, who were established in 2013 to fund the creation of new digital cultural content and provide free training, mentoring and online resources for organisations, artists and creative practitioners. Harmeet Chagger-Khan, Head of Digital Innovation for The Space says: “Adventures of a Cat in Space is a charming and funny, interactive game filled with catchy tunes that you’ll be singing for days.  The Space is delighted to support the project which sees Little Seeds venture from traditional music and storytelling into the gaming world to excite and engage younger audiences and families in new ways."</p>
<p>A demo will be released on 24th February 2025, ready for Steam Next Fest and it will have Native Linux support. The developer sent me over an early demo key, and the theme song is already firmly stuck in my head. This is going to be a good one, nice and family friendly too.</p>

<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that a big free Stellaris 4.0 update is coming later this year, and it's going to overhaul quite a lot. There's no date set for it yet but it will be sometime in Q2 2025, and will launch along with another major paid expansion.</p>
<p>This was originally announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">January 16</a>, with a follow-up first part to go over some more changes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/515199938040168701" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">January 23rd</a>.</p>

<em>Pictured - Stellaris, credit: Paradox.</em></p>
<p>As any Stellaris player will know, the game has grown to such a scale that there's so many moving parts, there's a lot that can break and performance can be an issue in the late game too with all the calculations the game is doing. So thankfully performance is going to be a big focus of it too.</p>
<p>To help players understand the game one thing that has been announced is the new compendium, allowing you to search through all sorts of things that will be in nice neat categories. They've been iterating over their tooltip system too, and this will all work together to give you all the info you need on every concept in the game. Sounds useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6165305121737636640gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's also going to be improvements to the Ship Designer as they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve taken the Ship Roles that were introduced in the 3.6 ‘Orion’ update and made selecting one part of the basic ship design flow and giving them a better representation than a scrollable text list. Some pain points of ship design, like the Auto-generate changes button blocking saving, have been removed, and in general it’s a faster and easier process to create a general ship design.</p>
<p>We’ve added a “Custom” role for veteran players that want to design the ship from scratch, or you can take one of these generated templates and modify them to suit your needs before saving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More updates to help newer players are coming as well, as the game does quickly get quite complicated, so they're making numerous quality of life improvements to make the game flow easier to understand.</p>
<p>On the subject of game-flow, they're converting events that don't need you to pick any options from a game-interrupting pop-up into a simpler "toasts or notifications". However, you'll be able to adjust it, as they're adding a Message Settings screen to change how you wish to view them all across notifications, toasts, pop-ups and auto-pause for each type. They also said that "Certain event chains that are not particularly loved have had (or will have) a bit of adjustment as well".</p>
<p>There's so much more like improvements to galaxy generation, and a big one they have in other Paradox games with Focus Trees, will make a sort-of appearance but tweaked for how different and dynamic Stellaris is. Instead of a set tree, they're going to add in "suggested tasks that fall into Conquest, Exploration, or Development aspiration categories".</p>

      <title>Palworld developer Pocketpair launches Pocketpair Publishing </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair are not slowing down, as they just launched their own video game publisher with Pocketpair Publishing.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing provides comprehensive support for game development through funding, development assistance, and publishing for indie game developers and small studios. Pocketpair Publishing promises to take a hands-off approach, providing as much support as developers need without overstepping or imposing strict conditions on the development process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/976035971737635846gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Their first published game has been announced as a brand new horror game from SURGENT STUDIOS, founded by British actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim. More from the press release:</p>
<p>From John "Bucky" Buckley, Head of Pocketpair Publishing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Pocketpair, there is nothing we love more than games, and Pocketpair Publishing is our latest venture to help the world enjoy gaming even more. Game development comes with many challenges, but we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to support SURGENT STUDIOS’ new title as our first step. We deeply sympathize with their original ideas and passion and are honoured to help them realize their vision. We will respect the autonomy and vision of developers and work together to make great games for people all over the world.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that more creators will be able to realize their dreams through Pocketpair Publishing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. This game will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say.</p>
<p>We’re still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we’ve come from and where we’re going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice to see that Pocketpair are using their success with Palworld to help other developers, even in the face of the Nintendo lawsuit that's ongoing.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.13 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed earlier this week while I was running around Wales, Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 6.13.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/1/19/281" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week, so I've tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release.</p>
<p>It's mostly some final driver fixes (gpu and networking dominating - normal), with some doc updates too. And various little stuff all over. The shortlog is appended for people who want to see the details (and, as always, it's just the shortlog for the last week, the full 6.13 log is obviously much too big).</p>
<p>With this, the merge window for 6.14 will obviously open tomorrow. I already have two dozen pull requests pending - thank you, you know who you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>A proper fix for data corruption on 64GB Steam Deck models. Plus a few other miscellaneous kernel improvements for Steam Deck APU support.</li>
<li>A fix for AMDGPU when running Steam games and YouTube videos together, to prevent a system hang with multiple monitors.</li>
<li>Case-insensitive support for tmpfs. An interesting one that can help Wine, Proton and Flatpak as noted:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The use case for this feature is similar to the use case for ext4, to better support compatibility layers (like Wine), particularly in combination with sandboxing/container tools (like Flatpak).<br/>
<br/>
Those containerization tools can share a subset of the host filesystem with an application. In the container, the root directory and any parent directories required for a shared directory are on tmpfs, with the shared directories bind-mounted into the container's view of the filesystem.<br/>
<br/>
If the host filesystem is using case-insensitive directories, then the application can do lookups inside those directories in a case-insensitive way, without this needing to be implemented in user-space. However, if the host is only sharing a subset of a case-insensitive directory with the application, then the parent directories of the mount point will be part of the container's root tmpfs. When the application tries to do case-insensitive lookups of those parent directories on a case-sensitive tmpfs, the lookup will fail"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new AMD 3D V-Cache optimizer driver to help X3D processors improve performance.</li>
<li>Improvements to Apple M1 device support.</li>
<li>The open source NVIDIA driver Nouveau got DRM panic support for nv50+ cards.</li>
<li>Improved support for various <em>older</em> Apple devices including phones, Apple TV, iPad and more.</li>
<li>Platform profile support for Dell laptops with new WMAX thermal interface, present on some Alienware X-Series, Alienware M-Series and Dell's G-Series laptops.</li>
<li>V3D driver for Raspberry Pi gets "Super Pages" support to help performance.</li>
<li>Added support for the Corsair Void headset family.</li>
<li>Lots more new hardware support as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual I'm just searching through and cherry-picking random bits here. It's a ridiculously long read as always with thousands of changes across all areas. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a particular addition you're excited to see that made it into Linux kernel 6.13? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck sales drop hard following the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement (updated: Valve fixed it)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 11:21AM</strong>: it's possible the weekly global top sellers list is having issues, as it's been pointed out some clearly top selling games vanished from the last week. I've reached out to Valve to see what's up.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 8:07PM</strong>: seems Valve got the message, and they've updated it. The Steam Deck on the weekly global top seller for the week beginning January 14th was actually <strong>4th</strong>, not 47th.</p>
<p>With that in mind here's an updated corrected version of the positions over time for you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4897488031737662833gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4897488031737662833gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So we can back to saying I'm right, nothing will dethrone it except a Steam Deck 2.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve's Steam Deck with SteamOS has been consistently in the top sales charts on Steam since release, but recently it dropped down rather hard following the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>I've been tracking the sales over time and have posted a few times about how well it was doing. However, the week during which the Nintendo Switch 2 was announced, it really has dropped down massively to the lowest point since the original release back in February 2022.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the global Steam sales charts are for revenue, not numbers sold, the Steam Deck is generally higher anyway since it's the equal cost of multiple sales of the most expensive games. Still, it's an interesting look into how the Steam Deck is doing overall and still means usually it's selling a lot considering the games it's up against sell often hundreds of thousands and millions.</p>
<p>Here's how it's position in the weekly global <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2025-1-14" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">top sellers list</a> has changed:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7485795531737628534gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7485795531737628534gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I guess I need to admit here I was wrong then don't I? Back in July 2024 when I last looked at this I said "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/will-anything-dethrone-the-steam-deck-probably-not/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not</a>", seems the Switch 2 did it.</p>
<p>Sales dropping was bound to happen eventually though, one way or another, and I do fully expect it to bounce back, but it's just surprising to see it drop down so drastically like that.</p>
<p>This won't cause any alarm bells to ring at Valve HQ though, they probably expected this to happen too. I don't expect them to speed up any work on a Steam Deck 2 due to this either. Valve clearly have a plan, especially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS coming to more devices</a>, and they're still waiting for a truly next-generation APU to slot into a Steam Deck 2.</p>

      <title>The devs of Celeste have cancelled their follow-up game Earthblade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extremely OK Games, creators of the popular platformer Celeste, have <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that their follow-up game Earthblade has now been cancelled. This was announced in a news post on their official website yesterday, January 22nd.</p>
<p>In the post titled "Final Earthblade Update" written by developer Maddy Thorson they mention clearly "Late last month, Noel and I made the difficult decision to cancel Earthblade". They said the decision was made in December but they waited until now to announce it.</p>
<p>As for why? Their team had a breakdown in communication with Pedro Medeiros, who they said is was "a founding member of EXOK, longtime friend &amp; collaborator, and art director of Earthblade and pixel/ui artist on Celeste and TowerFall". The issue: "a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which they said they won't be going into publicly.</p>
<p>Medeiros has moved onto their own game with <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Neverway</a>. Worth noting that Medeiros did post on X back in November 2024 that they had left EXOK:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19758198891737626172gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The decision to cancel Earthblade, the post from Thorson makes clear, was made by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. As for why? Multiple reasons it seems. The game wasn't as far along as they had hoped, along with the pressure of Celeste's success: "Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting".</p>
<p>Other members of their team have moved on now too, so Thorson and Berry are going back to smaller-scale projects and have begun prototyping again.</p>

      <title>AMD reveals AMDGPU Composition Stack, a fork of Wayland&#39;s Weston compositor for advancing the Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With many Linux desktops now running Wayland quite nicely, it seems it's time to keep pushing ahead. AMD have revealed what they call the AMDGPU Composition Stack (ACS).</p>
<p>This is a fork of Wayland's Weston compositor with some "additional advanced features". It all sounds pretty exciting when you look at what AMD developer Shashank Sharma noted on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/acs-wayland/weston/-/wikis/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab Wiki</a> page with these being the primary goals:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To act as a staging area for Weston/Wayland features to be opensourced to mainline.</li>
<li>To act as a reference compositor for AMD's advanced graphics and display feature development.</li>
<li>To provide a middleware compositor which extracts the best out of AMD Display and Graphics HW (We don't mind being biased to AMDGPU HW)
	<ul>
<li>To host some of the AMD HW specific code, which can't be merged in weston mainline due to its bias towards AMD HW.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be utilised in full stack opensource delivery vehicle for AMDs commercial solutions and products.</li>
<li>To be the space where AMD specific in-house SW tools (performance tweakers, multimedia players, 3D games, profiling tools etc) can be saved in future.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6400159901737583151gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6400159901737583151gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Picture credit: AMD</em></p>
<p>As noted on the Wiki page some initial features added include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VRR / Freesync.</li>
<li>MPO using underlays.</li>
<li>Color Management and Wide gamut support.</li>
<li>ACS media-player app.</li>
<li>Fullscreen HDR video playback.</li>
<li>Multi-seat config support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a basic video player included to "demonstrate some of these advance feature in a video playback context".</p>
<p>This was announced on the dri-devel <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2025-January/486833.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a popular free and open source library for developers that handles audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick and graphics with SDL 3 now available. Plus a new SDL 2 to SDL 3 compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Much like they already have <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sdl12-compat</a>, which allows you to use SDL 2 if you're stuck on SDL 1, they've also released <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl2-compat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sdl2-compat</a> for people stuck on SDL 2 to get the benefits of SDL 3.</p>
<p>There's a huge amount of new features and overall improvements including (taken from the SDL 3 <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release post</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 10.0 out now bringing Wayland and ARM64EC support, new FFmpeg multimedia back-end</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big release is here! The Windows compatibility layer Wine version 10.0 is officially out now bringing lots of big new features. Wine is a major part of what powers Valve's Proton, enabling thousands of Windows games to run on Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of what's new includes (compared with Wine 9):</p>
<ul>
<li>ARM64EC support</li>
<li>Wayland support that's enabled by default.</li>
<li>An FFmpeg-based multimedia back-end as an alternative to the GStreamer backend. Still experimental though, but should hopefully begin to improve Media Foundation support (good for gaming).</li>
<li>Much improved High-DPI support.</li>
<li>Network sessions are supported in DirectPlay.</li>
<li>An initial Bluetooth driver.</li>
<li>Support for the Dvorak keyboard layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots more! Full changelog on the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually we will see Valve update Proton as well to move it onto Wine 10 and see Proton 10 later this year.</p>
