      <title>Ubuntu 25.04 &#39;Plucky Puffin&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has today released Ubuntu 25.04, codenamed "Plucky Puffin", their latest feature upgrade release to one of the most popular Linux distributions. This also includes updates for all the other editions like Kubuntu. It will be supported for 9 months until January 2026 as this is not a long term support release.</p>
<p>This release has been dedicated to Steve Langasek, who sadly passed away January 1st. As said in the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subscribers to the <em>ubuntu-{devel-}announce</em> mailing list and long term participants in the Ubuntu community will have come across Steve Langasek’s work. Steve, known in the community as vorlon, was a long-term member of the Release team (along with being a member of Archive Admin, Techboard, SRU team, and so on) and a colleague to many of us at Canonical. As a member of the Release team, Steve was responsible for devising many of the processes, policies, and tools which we use today, and teaching his fellow members the ropes. <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/remembering-and-thanking-steve-langasek/52665" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steve passed away on 1st January 2025</a> after being unwell for quite some time. The Ubuntu Release Team dedicates 25.04 “Plucky Puffin” to our colleague and friend, Steve Langasek. He is missed and will live in our hearts forever. Thank you for everything, Steve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been running Kubuntu 25.04, since I prefer KDE Plasma, since the Beta release and it has been really smooth. Overall very happy with it as my main choice for my desktop workstation and gaming PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8906297911744913818gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8906297911744913818gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 25.04</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of upgrades in this one including Linux kernel 6.14, which includes the new NTSYNC driver for Wine / Proton. Although <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">don't get too excited</a> about it increasing Windows game performance. There's also the new ARM64 Desktop Image, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/gnome-48-released-with-notification-stacking-performance-improvements-and-initial-hdr-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 48</a> and lots of assorted software upgrades. For gamers on NVIDIA GPU laptops, you'll be hopefully pleased with NVIDIA Dynamic Boost being enabled by default which should give a bit more performance. Plus there's also support for newer Intel GPUs along with Mesa 25.0.</p>
<p>Installation and upgrades should be easier too. The installer added the option to replace an existing Ubuntu install, and there's better support for dual booting with Windows with BitLocker.</p>

      <title>Grab some great stuff for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming for April 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the new up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for April 17th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered v1.2 fixes &#34;excessive jitter&#34; with Frame Generation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered has been updated with another major patch version 1.2, which brings quite a few essential fixes along with a performance improvement for players on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So far the PC release seems to have been quite well received overall. It's Steam Deck Verified, with many players reporting it does work surprisingly well. It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam. Seems like overall that Nixxes and Naughty Dog have done great with it, a pretty stark comparison to all the issues when the first came to PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1488504191744909984gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Release Notes - 1.2.10416.0553</h4>
<ul>
<li>Addressed a bug where players were unable to fire weapons on the first mouse click, after using the mouse to restart a checkpoint.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would automatically fire their weapon, when aiming after a stealth kill, if the Reload/Quick Throw/Use action was mapped to [R].</li>
<li>Enabling NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation in the launcher now increases the frame rate by the same amount as enabling it in the in-game Display menu.</li>
<li>Addressed an issue where completing a No Return Challenge would not reward the player with the associated weapon skin.</li>
<li>Refracted light in the aquarium is no longer affected by high frame rates, preventing it from being distracting and overly flashy.</li>
<li>Resolved shadow pop-in issues on the side of a building and flickering in a blood stain on the floor of a building in the Capitol Hill area.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when loading into a cutscene with a wide Field of View setting.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that could cause Direct3D Invalid Call crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused some username text on No Return leaderboards to appear as question marks.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue that could cause dark lines to appear in volumetric fog during camera movement on ultrawide aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Updated AMD FidelityFx to version 1.1.3 and resolved excessive jitter on Steam Deck when FSR Frame Generation is enabled.</li>
<li>Addressed a bug where pressing 'Reset to Default' in the Graphics menu would cause the preset to incorrectly appear as 'Custom'.</li>
<li>Various fixes for visual bugs in ultrawide cinematics.</li>
<li>Various stability improvements.</li>
<li>Various localization fixes.</li>
<li>Various UI bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stress-testing and hardware monitoring tool OCCT has officially released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more apps like this arrive with official Linux support! OCCT for Linux is here and out of Beta testing bringing a full stress-testing and hardware monitoring suite.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the announcement they said the Linux version can do basically everything the Windows version can:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive Stress Tests – Evaluate CPU, GPU, and memory performance under heavy workloads to ensure the stability and reliability of your system.</li>
<li>Advanced Monitoring Tools – Get real-time insights about temperature, voltage, power consumption, and other critical system metrics.</li>
<li>Multi-Platform Support – Compatible with major Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Redhat, Arch Linux, and many more.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface – A streamlined and intuitive UI accessible to all users.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only the start though, as they said they will "keep enhancing OCCT's monitoring capabilities on Linux" although it's already "fully polished". Next up their priority is to provide the "highly anticipated SSD testing feature".</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Engestrom announced the release of the latest Mesa 25.0.4 stable bug-fix release, and we're also closing in on the next feature release with Mesa 25.1 seeing a first release candidate for testing.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.0.4.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa 25.0.4</a> there's bug fixes for Elden Ring, The Last of Us Part 1, The Last of Us Part 2, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black, The Headliners and other games across different drivers. The full changes are listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<p>During Early Access the game managed to hit a Very Positive rating from Steam players.</p>

<p>From the developer: "Another special stage in the development of #DRIVE Rally is behind us. Now is definitely the perfect moment to pop the champagne. However, this doesn't mean we're going to slow down! We hope that with the launch of the full version, more players will join our community and the number of gamers who love classic rally racing as much as we do will grow. As a team, we wish you an adrenaline-fueled, thrilling experience, and we're excited to hear from you about your impressions, so we can continue fine-tuning the game post-launch. We are also still working on console versions, which we hope to release later this year." — Dariusz Pietrala, Game Director w Pixel Perfect Dude.</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite Linux 42 brings Beta support for the MSI Claw handhelds and lots of other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Building on top of the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42 release</a>, Bazzite 42 is out now for this increasingly popular SteamOS-like option to put on your handhelds, desktops and more.</p>
<p>The project continues to grow quite nicely too, and they've shared another snapshot of recent statistics that show Bazzite as having around 29.5K active users as of April. Which is up from the 26.3K they showed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steamos-like-bazzite-linux-has-some-nice-growth-thanks-to-great-handheld-pc-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17636506341744881309gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17636506341744881309gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As for what's new with Bazzite 42 there's of course all the enhancements from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42</a> along with Beta support for the MSI Claw handhelds, there's improved HDR for both GNOME and KDE too along with "various improvements throughout the project". Another nice adjustment is improved HTPC support (Home Theater PC) with a patch for Steam's audio output resetting so it should now stick to what you set.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some future plans were also outlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our team is working with the folks at Fyra Labs (Ultramarine Linux) on a new Live ISO experience that may come to Bazzite in the future and a new Flatpak store is on the way to replace the aging Discover/Software thanks to Glorious Eggroll. Additionally, Yafti is being replaced with a modern and better first-run installer as soon as possible, and we’ll continue to work on expanding to new handhelds. As always if you want to come join us everything here is built in GitHub. We’d love the additional support!</p>

      <title>Moonsigil Atlas is a deckbuilding roguelike with tile-based energy that&#39;s Tetris meets Slay The Spire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this blending of ideas looks damn cool. Moonsigil Atlas looks like it really warps deckbuilders into something quite unique, and I can't wait to check this one out. The developer said it's basically Tetris meets Slay the Spire, and as far as comparisons go it's quite a fun hook to think on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2503700591744819790gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2503700591744819790gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here you play your cards by positioning special magic sigils on the big crescent moon, playing as many as you can that you have the space to fit in. The game will have multiple characters to play as, along with hundreds of cards for a whole lot of possible decks to build.</p>
<p>Depending on where you place your sigils you might get bonuses for adjacency, overlap, and more. With some persisting between turns, or with ongoing effects, and enemies to face that can cast their own hostile sigils to mess with you too. </p>
<p>I really do love the style of this one. Check out their announcement trailer below:</p>

      <title>Horripilant is a chilling incremental dungeon crawl through the horrors of a forgotten underworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pas Game Studio recently revealed the freaky looking Horripilant. A game that combines elements of an idler, puzzle and autobattler that sees you fight, mine, and think your way through the depths of a forsaken dungeon. Probably one of the most unique looking dungeon crawlers I've ever seen.</p>
<p>It looks wild, and it's currently going through Beta testing, with a Native Linux build being put up, and the they showed it running on a Steam Deck on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/traz.bsky.social/post/3lmwtv2hhgk2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzHhzFOaIyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce75adfa576bd4c9ff55cd25f896ab2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzHhzFOaIyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Story</p>
<p>You awaken. An old, battered knight, lost in the darkest corners of an abandoned dungeon, with no memory of how you got there. The stench of decay permeates the thick air. The walls seem to whisper your name.</p>
<p>As you stir, a strange tree sprout catches your eye. You hit it, for the voice demands it of you; a twig breaks off onto the ground. With your newfound resource, you seem to be able to ameliorate your equipment. Distorted moans echo from an empty staircase. The voice calls to you again, beckoning you. You must go down. It is your purpose...</p>
<p>Encounter bizarre characters, solve cryptic puzzles, and survive the horrors that lurk in every shadow. Will you escape this living nightmare, or will it consume you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Incrementally gain and collect materials.</li>
<li>Combat horrific foes in the dungeon.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and explore the depths of your camp.</li>
<li>Upgrade your gear to venture deeper.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meet god and gain strong boons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat, adapt, and survive. The depths need you, and you need it.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 42 is out now with KDE Plasma Desktop promoted and x86 programs on ARM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big release for the Linux world is here. Fedora Linux 42 has arrived bringing with it the latest and greatest in open source software and a good choice to run on your desktops, laptops and more.</p>
<p>One of my favourite changes that came with this release is the promotion of the KDE Plasma Desktop to "Edition" status, giving it a front-row seat to show it has great support. Giving a true flagship status to my personal pick for the best desktop environment, and the same one used on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11801586791744816273gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The official Fedora website</em></p>
<p>Additionally, the enhancement of running <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/new-in-fedora-running-x86-programs-on-arm-systems/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">x86 programs on ARM systems</a> out of the box on Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop 42. Using some of the work originally developed for Fedora Asahi Remix for Apple systems.</p>
<p>You'll be getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/gnome-48-released-with-notification-stacking-performance-improvements-and-initial-hdr-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 48</a> or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/kde-plasma-6-3-is-out-now-with-big-fractional-scaling-improvements-drawing-tablet-upgrades-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KDE Plasma 6.3</a> depending on which edition you pick, each desktop release bringing with it plenty of enhancements covered here in previous articles.</p>
<p>Some other general changes they highlighted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fedora default wallpapers are now delivered in the JXL format instead of PNG, reducing file sizes while maintaining quality.</li>
<li>More laptop cameras used in recent models will work out-of-the-box, following up on work done in Fedora Linux 41</li>
<li>System boot times should be faster, as the plymouth system component will no longer load the full graphics driver before showing the system splash screen.</li>
<li>With the Anaconda installer running as a native Wayland application, language selections now sync between the live environment and installed system.</li>
<li>Executable file placement is simpler, as anything previously in <em>/usr/sbin</em> is now merged into <em>/usr/bin.</em></li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA 575.51.02 Beta driver brings NVIDIA Smooth Motion support to Linux, GeForce RTX 5060 series announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nearly a month since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/nvidia-570-133-07-driver-released-for-linux-with-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last stable update</a>, NVIDIA have today released the 575.51.02 Beta driver that brings with it support for NVIDIA Smooth Motion on Linux along with various bug fixes. NVIDIA also formally announced the GeForce RTX 5060 series. <em>In case you missed it NVIDIA also recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/nvidia-open-sourced-physx-and-flow-gpu-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open sourced PhysX and Flow GPU code</a>.</em></p>
<p>Here's the full list of what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extended the __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC environment variable, which was available to EGL applications, to also apply to GLX and Vulkan applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Marvel Rivals to crash on startup or when loading levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the applications that use the VK_KHR_present_wait extension to hang on Wayland.</li>
<li>Added support for GLX front buffer rendering on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Minecraft to crash on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME Render Offload from working correctly when using NVIDIA GPUs as both the render offload source and the render offload sink.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented VRR from working when overriding an EDID through the /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/edid_override interface.</li>
<li>Added support for the DRM plane properties COLOR_ENCODING and COLOR_RANGE.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Default TGP and Max TGP values from being reported in the nvidia-settings control panel while running notebook systems on battery power.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to display freezes on some systems when toggling Night Mode with GNOME on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause graphics applications to not render correctly after a system suspend/resume cycle, if using the nvidia.ko kernel module parameter NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Added support for NVIDIA Smooth Motion. See the "NVIDIA Smooth Motion" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended the nvidia-powerd daemon to also support Dynamic Boost while a notebook is running on battery power. See the "Dynamic Boost on Linux" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-modeset driver to trim trailing whitespace from the product name passed to the GPU's audio device as part of the EDID-Like Data (ELD).</li>
<li>Dropped support for NV_PLANE_BLEND_CTM, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_TF, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT_SIZE, and NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_MULTIPLIER DRM plane properties on Linux kernels earlier than 6.8 to avoid exceeding DRM_OBJECT_MAX_PROPERTY.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause render-offloaded applications using KDE Frameworks 6 to crash.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/243334/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></p>
<p>For the new Smooth Motion support, NVIDIA give info on what it is and how it works on Linux in their <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/575.51.02/README/nvpresent.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">readme</a> which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.</p>
<p>The feature supports x86_64 Vulkan applications.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Smooth Motion can be enabled by setting the environment variable <code class="inline-code">NVPRESENT_ENABLE_SMOOTH_MOTION=1</code> when launching a game. This will enable the <code class="inline-code">VK_LAYER_NV_present</code> implicit Vulkan layer, which overrides the application's presentation to inject additional frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the GeForce RTX 5060 series the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti (16GB / 8GB) is out today, and the GeForce RTX 5060 (8GB) arrives in May.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s SteamOS 3.7.3 Preview improves support for Asus and Lenovo handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced in January</a> that a public beta of Steam Deck's SteamOS is coming for more handhelds, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial SteamOS 3.7 Preview</a> added the start of it and now the latest SteamOS 3.7.3 Preview brings more improvements for other handhelds.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">SteamOS 3.7.3 Preview "Variable Release Rate" arrived April 16 with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529844242184405003" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for frame limiting with VRR displays (internal and external).</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when no displays are connected.</li>
<li>Added support for the power button on Asus and Lenovo handhelds.</li>
<li>Improved input support for Asus and Lenovo handhelds.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is available for Steam Deck in the Preview channel (Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel).</p>
<p>Many people have been trying it on other handhelds using the SteamOS recovery image download, but it's <em>not</em> recommended yet since there's still a <em>lot</em> of work to be done but clearly Valve are making some nice steps towards that proper public release.</p>
<p>Exciting times ahead for the Linux gaming community. The public SteamOS 3 release should be quite a big boost. And hopefully we'll see more hardware vendors support it officially with you being able to eventually buy more handhelds with SteamOS 3 shipping on them like the Legion Go S.</p>

      <title>Ludaro puts a roguelike deck-building twist on the classic board game Ludo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whatever will developers turn into a deck-builder next? Ludo, apparently. The classic board game has been warped into Ludaro. Well, if Balatro can turn Poker into a roguelike, why not this classic and the trailer actually makes it look quite fun.</p>
<p>Here you collect special Spirit Cards as you go that allow you to reshape the game. You can change your dice rolls, alter the board to make new paths and stack lots of passive effects "until reality bends to your will". Ludaro sounds pretty chaotic with new rules being thrown in every so often so you need to keep changing your strategy too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FSyyM3cMs5Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a45e3f59c061b81fd351a07ef343eb84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FSyyM3cMs5Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roll the Dice, Play Your Way</strong></p>
<p>Rolling the dice isn’t just about luck—it’s about timing, planning, and taking the right risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>You always know what’s still possible—but never what comes next.</li>
<li>Play it safe, or push your luck for massive rewards.</li>
<li>Every roll is a moment of strategy—will you take control, or embrace the chaos?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stack Powers, Build Your Own Luck</strong></p>
<p>Along the way, you’ll unlock wild and unpredictable upgrades that push every run to new heights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit Cards that change the way you play.</li>
<li>Abilities that make every roll stronger, riskier, or more rewarding.</li>
<li>Creatures that reshape the board and unlock hidden opportunities.</li>
<li>Effects that combine, stack, and lead to explosive turns.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due out sometime in "Fall 2025" with Native Linux support and they said it's "optimized for Steam Deck".</p>
<p>Really looking forward to this one.</p>

      <title>The final Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 patch is out now with cross-play, photo mode, new subclasses</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's done, finished! The final Baldur's Gate 3 content update is here along with a special animated short to mark the occasion. As expected, is a rather large enhancement to the game with some very long patch notes.</p>
<p>Along with all the new content, photo mode and fixes, they've also done a tweak for the Steam Deck which has FSR 2.2 set to "Quality" by default. Hopefully this will result in a better overall experience. Exciting for players across different platforms is that you can now play together. PC, Mac, Xbox and PlayStation 5 can all do multiplayer with full cross-platform progression and cross-play using the Larian Network.</p>

      <title>D.O.T. Defence is a fast-paced gamepad-friendly RTS now on Steam with co-op and versus modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Real time chaotic strategy simplified to make it work well on a gamepad? With single-player, versus and co-op modes? D.O.T. Defence is out in Early Access with Native Linux support made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to D.O.T. Defence, a simplified yet deeply strategic RTS experience that seamlessly blends accessibility with tactical depth. We offer a simplified economy system, massive automated battles with light command, and a fun simplified upgrade system. Play in short bursts as matches last between 5-10 minutes! The only objective is to protect your HQ and destroy the enemies! Crafted by developers passionate about the genre, this game delivers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of their childhoods."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6-4gR71xGh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/352956c5a895f184aa3cbd153547ad82.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6-4gR71xGh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's available during Early Access (from the developer):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight with Friends and Bots</strong>: Jump into local multiplayer mayhem with 1v1, 2v2, and chaotic free-for-all battles against your buddies or cunning AI.</li>
<li><strong>Dominate the Battlefield</strong>: Capture and hold key strategic locations to build vital facilities and keep supply lines flowing. Control the economy, bolster your troops, and pave the way to victory!</li>
<li><strong>Simple Controls, Deep Strategy</strong>: Don't let the gamepad focus fool you – there's plenty of strategic depth here. Issue broad commands or fine-tune unit paths, you can even let your units autonomously secure crucial points. It's the perfect blend of accessible fun and engaging tactics.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Updates Incoming!</strong>: We're committed to making D.O.T. Defence the best it can be. Expect frequent updates throughout Early Access with fresh content, exciting new features and improvements driven by YOUR FEEDBACK!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said it will be in Early Access for at least 5-8 months as they plan quite a lot more content to come including a campaign for all three factions, new game modes, more gameplay modifiers, more maps and so on.</p>
<p>I picked up a personal copy and so far I actually <em>really</em> like the idea of it. Being able to buddy up with someone, each with a gamepad in hand while trying to destroy each-other can be good fun. Although, some versus matches feel a little bit like they drag on a little due to how simplified it is, with you only equipping 4 possible structures each. That feeling gets better as you play more and unlock other possibilities, so each player can do something a little different. But still, not a lot of room for different strategies in the versus mode.</p>
<p>Playing co-op though is quite different in the waves-based mode, as working together you each get your own gold income to build up defences so it's a lot of fun chatting away as you decide on your little plan of action.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19329940051744724316gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19329940051744724316gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15359769861744724319gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15359769861744724319gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm really keen to see how they expand it during Early Access but what's there right now is a great start. Their idea of adding in a more long-term 4x-like "Global Domination" mode sounds interesting.</p>

      <title>I can&#39;t wait to send people flying in Aquapark Tycoon - new trailer out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aquapark Tycoon from Boxelware, who previously made the space sim Avorion, is an upcoming water theme park building game and a new trailer is out now. It's still in development with a release planned sometime this year, and it will have Native Linux support like their previous game.</p>
<p>The game was originally unveiled live at the gaming event Caggtus in Leipzig, Germany back in April last year. Boxelware was once again on board this year, presenting the new trailer. The development team continues to work on new features, and have been posting developer blogs on Steam going over what features they've been adding into the game including a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2819470/view/499443042471641204" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">whole bunch</a> of Saunas.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the new trailer below:</p>

<p>I'm excited for this one, are you? Especially since it will have online co-op too.</p>

      <title>A public alpha of the &#39;semi-immutable&#39; Manjaro Summit Linux is now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The future of Linux distributions in many ways seems like immutable may be a good path, and now the Manjaro team want you to test out their own version of it with Manjaro Summit. Originally called Manjaro Immutable, it's now Manjaro Summit and a public Alpha release has now been made available.</p>
<p>More about it as explained by a developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manjaro Summit is a semi-immutable distro with an atomic update system. Updates are done by downloading pre-made disk images, the root partition is read-only and only parts of the filesystem are migrated upon update.</p>
<p>The benefit of such a system is that everyone is running a near identical system configuration, this makes it easier to reproduce bugs and issues. Images can also be tested before being published. And should an update prove to be bad, you can simply roll back to an older unaffected version.</p>
<p>The immutability makes the system more resistant to user and software error, it also provides some limited protection against malware.</p>
<p>We are still unsure what Summit will eventually become, a stable rolling workstation distro, or an always moving distro chasing the latest and greatest in software.</p>
<p>The technology powering summit is purpose build to be as simple as possible, it is encouraged for people to start building and sharing images and configurations which fit their usecase or that of a wider community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's still quite a lot missing and to be done on it, since it's a public Alpha testing release.</p>

      <title>Save the world from insidious and cruel demons in Bosorka with a Linux version available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bosorka is an action roguelike where a young witch saves the world from insidious and cruel demons. To celebrate the first anniversary, the developer has released a Native Linux version. Developed by Sengi Games, who also made The Serpent Rogue, this update was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2118370/announcements/detail/814696363551884843" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> Monday April 14th on Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: "Bosorka is an exciting action game that combines the best elements of the roguelike and shoot'em up genres with incredibly stylized top-down 3D visualization. Immerse yourself in this dark fantasy world and show the demons who's the power to be reckoned with."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VeMp9DadP-Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97175f666dd92a610ff832d9eb9c5e1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VeMp9DadP-Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Exciting journeys to various locations - Several huge levels are generated from manually created parts. Each level is an independent biome with its own unique atmosphere, mysteries and dangerous creatures. Secret rooms, hidden passages, breathtaking landscapes, and lots of valuable things that can be encountered in unexpected places provide a real incentive to explore the environment.</li>
<li>Bosses from the netherworld - At the end of each level, you will meet powerful monsters that guard the passages to the next locations, preventing you from following the book. Each monster has an exceptional set of uncanny abilities and is capable of incinerating you in an instant, so one should be well prepared for this encounter.</li>
<li>Companion Demons - In the midst of a circle of evil demons, there may be renegades who have not been affected by evil spells and have no bad intentions. Lovely creatures, surprisingly loyal to those who save them. Raise an entire army of companions who will help you in the fight against the enemy. Some of them have marvelous abilities that will definitely come in handy.</li>
<li>Caution! Dangerous Spells - Destroy enemy hordes of evil creatures by means of powerful spells. Burn, freeze, strike with incredible lightning bolts, or pelt everyone with slimy frogs — there're various spells to suit every taste. Mysterious mirrors hidden in different corners of these regions will reveal to you new spells to defend this world from. Find them and develop the tactics to wipe out the evil.</li>
<li>Amazing combinations of collected items - Strong health, protective shell, poisonous touch or a deadly whirlwind around you, and perhaps even more. Make your own unique collection of runes. Each rune performs only one function, but the combination of several of them can significantly change the entire gameplay, turning you into a real natural calamity. And now, who is hunting who?</li>
<li>Exciting flight on a broomstick - An enchanted witch's broom is not only a means of transportation. Each broom has its own specialty and is capable of a great deal more than just flying. Unblock all the brooms, master their special skills, and you will surely find your favorite to lead you to victory.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more developers are still doing direct Native Linux support. It's currently rated Steam Deck Verified, although it's an older rating that was using Proton 8.</p>

      <title>MySims and MySims Kingdom from EA get Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) announced that both MySims and MySims Kingdom have been upgraded with "some things we have been working on for a long time" which includes Steam Deck support for both titles. They were originally released for the Nintendo DS and Wii back in 2007, and had re-releases on Steam back in march 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15963981381744711693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck compatibility for both titles, allowing you to play on the go!
	<ul>
<li>Tip: The trackpad will function as a mouse, while the joystick and buttons will act as an Xbox controller. You can't use both at once, so, if you nudge the trackpad any joystick or button input will allow the controller to regain functionality. If you want to change controllers while playing on the steam deck, you will need to configure that within the deck itself to recognize a new primary controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In MySims, added the ability to move Sims into the Garden area, opening up room for 8 new residents</li>
<li>In both MySims and MySims: Kingdom, added 4 more skin tones for players to choose from, allowing for increased customization of your Sim.</li>
<li>Steam Trading Cards are now available!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Fixed Bugs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A lantern option, currently only available for Goth Boy and Madame Zoe, is now available for all buildings once unlocked in MySims</li>
<li>Multiple songs now loop in Workshop and remodel modes in MySims</li>
<li>Resolved a softlock if you invite a commercial Sim to move in, but then change your mind to invite another; leading to no one being able to move in</li>
<li>Hand and arm skin tones match the face on all outfits now in both games</li>
<li>Buddy and Lyndsay’s icons appear during Island transitions in Kingdom</li>
<li>Fixed flickering visual glitch on Trevor’s Island in Kingdom</li>
<li>Thanks to your feedback, we have been made aware of some discrepancies in the lighting and cutscenes. Adjustments have been made to Kingdom to ensure a more consistent experience in some of our characters from the original MySims game.</li>
<li>Changes made in the Garden now persist after leaving / saving</li>
<li>Various memory and performance improvements to resolve crashes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really loving seeing more classic games get a fresh life on PC. And if they work well on Steam Deck, they'll work on Desktop Linux too thanks to Valve's Proton. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FCrtpPz-WUo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e648663bfe7d0cef4c6ba38cc8873179.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FCrtpPz-WUo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about why the features took so long in the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3328910/view/592894082264597444" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned the age of the games and the custom systems involved, and hilariously how they "break if you look at them the wrong way". With a small team working on the ports they wanted to take time to get them perfected.</p>
<p>Seems like Valve will need to put both through verification, since currently MySims is "Unsupported" and MySims Kingdom is unrated currently. Perhaps they can both be bumped up to Steam Deck Verified now.</p>

      <title>First person puzzle-adventure metroidvania Memory&#39;s Reach looks great with Steam Deck support announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Memory's Reach is a very promising looking first-person puzzle-adventure metroidvania, and the good news is that it will have Steam Deck support at launch.</p>
<p>More about it: "Explore a Long Lost Alien Planet - Armed with nothing more than old star charts, dubious rumors, and your trusty spaceship, travel to the long-lost planet Virishal. Explore a world of towering megastructures and overgrown ruins - a civilization wiped clean in a great cataclysm, its monuments now reclaimed by steaming jungles, buried in crumbling mineshafts, and falling to ruin in slowly decaying orbits. Somewhere on this world is hidden the ancient treasure of the Mairi, sealed away eons ago to protect it from the great cataclysm. Explore Virishal and locate the treasure - but beware what other perilous secrets lie sleeping below the planet's surface!"</p>
<p>Their latest trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bsViVj6gnMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6999dddebf2df812cb94296609badef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bsViVj6gnMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2126810/announcements/detail/669455275569185504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Steam Deck Support</h4>
Steam Deck is now officially supported with customized default settings and a larger UI.<br/>
<br/>
The first time you run the game on Steam Deck it will apply custom default settings optimized for 40fps, but you can of course tweak the settings yourself, which brings me to...<br/>
<h4>New Settings in the New Settings Menu</h4>
The settings UI has been overhauled. It's cleaner, less buggy, and now only takes up half the screen so you can see the effects of your changes in real time.<br/>
Many settings options have been tweaked, added, or removed as development has progressed, but a few highlights in this update include:
<ul>
<li>Added support for FSR and DLSS upscaling. Either of these upscalers can be used to significantly boost performance. FSR is available on Windows, Mac, and Steam Deck. DLSS is available on Windows PCs with a compatible NVIDIA GPU.</li>
<li>Added UI scaling option. On Steam Deck this will default to the maximum value. I also recommend adjusting this if you're playing on a TV or large monitor. Just note that the UI is still a work in progress (most of it still uses placeholder art) so some of the scaling can be a little inconsistent and not all elements will always scale evenly. This will improve as development continues and the final UI art begins to be implemented.</li>
<li>Added additional graphics settings for performance optimization and accessibility.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they have it working on Steam Deck, it will also work on Desktop Linux thanks to Valve's Proton. And, this means hopefully good performance if they're doing proper testing to announce support.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer CSR-Studios are currently working on Dead Pixels II but they decided to give the original Dead Pixels from 2012 a surprise upgrade. This comes with Native Linux support and they're hoping to see it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about the game: "A toxic waste spill finds its way into the water supply, causing the recently deceased to rise from their graves. Now it's up to you to blast your way through the hordes of undead if you're going to escape the city. On the way to your rescue, you'll search stores and houses for supplies, and trade with other survivors. With three game modes, hundreds of items, weapons and grenades, and a city that is never the same twice, there is always something new hiding round the corner in Dead Pixels. When the Dead Start Walking, It's Time to Run."</p>
<p>It features over 100 weapons, a different procedurally generated city each time you play, multiple game modes, multiple difficulty modes, solo and local co-op, online leaderboards and more.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft open sourced Chroma, their colourblind simulation tool</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wonderful to see! Ubisoft announced yesterday that they've open sourced their colourblind simulation tool Chroma (UbiChroma as it's called on GitHub), after several years of internal use and development.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said "With an estimated 300 million people around the world affected by colorblindness, Chroma allows developers to accurately replicate their experience and create accessible content to meet their needs. The open-source tool works by applying a filter over the game screen without hindering performance".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5753043281744710026gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5753043281744710026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Over the past few years, Chroma has proven to be a highly efficient tool for us at Ubisoft," says David Tisserand, Director of Accessibility. "It has allowed us to assess the accessibility of our games for colorblind players much faster and more comprehensively than ever before. Because we believe accessibility is a journey, not a race, we're thrilled to share Chroma with the entire industry. We invite everyone to benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development."</p>
<p>"Chroma was created with a clear purpose---making color blindness accessibility a natural part of the creative and testing process," says Jawad Shakil, QC Product Manager. "The team faced and overcame significant challenges while building it, but through close collaboration with accessibility experts and by refining the tool based on feedback, they created a solution that eliminated lag and inaccuracies, making accessibility testing efficient and smooth. Chroma is a testament to the team's innovation and dedication; their work is already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind. Open-sourcing Chroma is a proud step forward, allowing everyone to benefit from this innovation."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Key features (from GitHub):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Color Simulation on single monitor. This solution works on top of game and can be maximized as per requirement.</li>
<li>Work on all games. No dependency on any specific game or engine.</li>
<li>High performance. Able to simulation live gameplay upto 60 FPS.</li>
<li>Accurate results.</li>
<li>Simulation of all type of color blind forms.</li>
<li>Only available solution which capture screen live gameplay screen and simulate.</li>
<li>Easy screenshot to log error.</li>
<li>Easy and configurable UI.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Merging a western with eldritch horror, Blood West is awesome and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the latest update out today, Blood West from Hyperstrange and New Blood Interactive is now Steam Deck Verified and well worth a look. Blending together a western and eldritch horror, it's been on my watchlist for a while now because it just looks so damn good.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1587130/announcements/detail/837214361691882655?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it on Steam for the Blood West v4.3.0 update that features a new codex system to keep track of all your notes, new music additions, new achievements and they even teased that a New Game+ mode is coming. Valve checked it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> so it's good to go on Desktop Linux too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mlX_2ch4K1c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27d72369314633086530c4da60daa080.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mlX_2ch4K1c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some more of what the update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Bug fixes:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Chapter 1 boss would become unresponsive if the player performed save &amp; load at the start of the boss fight</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Rotten Skeleton’s incorrect behavior if his soul was sold and the player simply rested in a bed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where combination of Watch and Tentacle Cyst artifacts as well as maxed out Strong Lungs trait would allow player to “skip” from place to place</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Doctor in Chapter 3 would not give his sidequest</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Alvaro’s Rib where it would grant different boost values than expected when combined with certain artifacts, perks or consumables</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Hangman’s Noose kill streak would be interrupted with a headshot when using any shotgun</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where player was able to heal themselves with the Cursed Doll weapon by using its secondary attack on dead enemies’ heads (lol)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it was impossible to remove certain weapons that required “death or Purple revival” even after dying if player died while holding a different weapon in hand</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would take twice as mumch damage when landing on ladders or rope</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where regular Cultists in Dead Man’s Promise would give a lot more Soul Essence than they should</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where status effect icons would remain on screen when loaded into a new map and a dialogue was instantly triggered</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Hellfire Cultist's would have a second heart as a loot even after his heart was already stolen using pickpocketing</li>
<li>Lots of controller related issues have been fixed</li>
<li>Few language improvements have been added as well</li>
</ul>
<strong><u>Improvements:</u></strong>
<ul>
<li>Font size has been scaled up - this change is both for PC and Steam Deck and should make everything much easier to read. This also means Blood West is officially Steam Deck verified!</li>
<li>Added “drop item” functionality for controllers - default bind can be changed in the Settings menu</li>
<li>Added an option to change default metric units from meters to <strong>paces</strong>. <em>For immersions sake :)</em></li>
<li>Added a launch parameter “-nogamepad” on Steam - when used, it disables any non-keyboard/mouse inputs that could in specific cases cause issues. To enable it, just enter the command in the Launch Options in Blood West’s properties on Steam.</li>
<li>Chapter 2 boss is now slightly tougher and a bit more aggressive (rawr)</li>
<li>Lady Anabelle or The Priest will offer discounts to their wares if given the cure (mind you, this will only affect games where the player didn’t give the Cure to any of those characters yet)</li>
<li>Purple Revival now removes Blessings as well</li>
<li>Resolution in the Settings menu is now a proper dropdown list</li>
<li>Improvements to the input system to better handle certain cases like when player uses AZERTY keyboard layout and changes certain keybinds</li>
<li>Totem of Souls voice is now more “spectral” (at Gianni's request)</li>
<li>Improvements to the quest tracking and journal entries for a few Chapter 2 quests</li>
<li>A slew of small SFX improvements</li>
</ul>

      <title>4A Games are giving away Metro 2033 Redux free for 48 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quick tip - if you've never had the chance to experience the Metro series, now you can without paying a penny as 4A Games are giving away Metro 2033 Redux. They're celebrating 15 years of the game (going by the date of the original version).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hl7wY1yILsM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d115fa7b10f96250f1b4e35f0c5960a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hl7wY1yILsM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the Earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age.</p>
<p>The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.</p>
<p>Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind. But what if the real threat comes from within?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The giveaway ends April 16 at 5PM CET | 9AM PT | 4PM BST. You can grab it on PC via Steam and GOG. The game is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and it has a Native Linux version (but generally works better via Proton as it's an old port).</p>

      <title>GNOMES is my new favourite tower defense game that blends in roguelike mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you don't hear from me much over this week (or for the rest of this month), it's because I'm dedicating my time to playing GNOMES. A new tower defense roguelike hybrid from developer DYSTOPIAN with ever-expanding biomes to battle through. <em>DIsclosure: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>The feeling I got from it instant reminded me of the unholy addiction I had to the also excellent Loop Hero. Thanks to the clean retro style and the brilliant way it really hooks you in. GNOMES definitely looks simple on the surface but it's surprisingly deep.</p>
<p>Here to start a run you pick a guild which changes up what buildings and "towers" (GNOMES) you can build, pick a biome that changes what enemies and hazards you'll face and then attempt to progress for as long as possible. The biome level you pick will just keep on expanding with every new wave, with enemy spawn positions also constantly changing around. Thankfully, there's lots of objects you can buy and put down to change enemy wave paths, and your GNOMES can be moved around too each wave as you'll attempt to keep them away from your home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12770944291744638170gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12770944291744638170gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since the map keeps on expanding, you have a lot of room to grow during a run. This is necessary with the enemy wave paths changing each time, along with all the different types of enemies you'll be facing. It really does get quite challenging in the later waves.</p>
<p>After each wave is done you get access to the shop. Here you'll be spending up all your gold to buy up different crops and other assorted objects, which help you to earn gold to then purchase more upgrades, special relics, crops, new GNOMES to defend with and more. Part of the challenge here is that you can only stack up a limited amount of different items to build, so spending your coins wisely and attempting to plan ahead is how it gets you.</p>
<p>The crop system is a big part of the fun here. There's an assortment of different crops that all do different things like spreading fertile soil to let you place more, each give different gold amounts, some have a special adjacency bonus, some might buff up nearby GNOMES power and more. Some crops will even just <em>continually</em> spread across the map until it's full, especially useful if they deal damage when enemies trample over them. Although some crops can end up a double-edge sword, as they'll block your GNOME positioning too.</p>
<p>The result is that you can make some really powerful combinations, and the game really is different each run depending on what you pick. </p>
<p>Over email the developer told me "We're just two dudes taking on the corpo giants with a $0 budget, no publisher or game engine" and it seems they've struck some gold here. After releasing on April 4th, they've already managed to hit over 11,000 sales on Steam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7mvNTEwZgbQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b476031bbae1de0b792074a3deeeac51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7mvNTEwZgbQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Based Tower Defense</strong> - On your turn, you can move your gnomes as often as you like. Use different combinations of relics and plant abilities to help them survive the night.</li>
<li><strong>Relics, Crops and Upgrades</strong> - Each plant, relic, tool and building creates a different possible synergies. Manipulate your environment an and exploit the resources the map provides you. Grow your economy quickly, but don’t forget to defend it.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse Procedurally-Generated Biomes</strong> - Distinct biomes with procedurally generated environment, map specific enemies, different hazards and resources. Every run is different.</li>
<li><strong>Guilds with Unique Starts</strong> - Each guild stars a different type of gnome accompanied by their own starting economy and a game changing relic. Every guild has different strengths and weaknesses. Some will struggle where others thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Mode</strong> - Test your strategy against randomized waves of enemies that become exponentially more difficult every night. After you defeat the goblin king for the first time, you're given the option to continue your run until the goblins overwhelm you. How many nights can you survive?</li>
</ul>

<p>Tested on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> it works perfectly. An absolute must-buy. I was instantly hooked.</p>

      <title>V Rising 1.1 - Invaders of Oakveil will bring lots of new content and official Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>V Rising 1.1 - Invaders of Oakveil is set to release on April 28th and it's going to bring much improved and official support for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Along with a whole lot of new content and improvements across the whole game, their official update page when you scroll down a fair bit under the Additional Features heading states:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>STEAM DECK COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<p>Take your Vampire conquest anywhere! V Rising is now officially supported on Steam Deck, with optimized controls and performance for seamless handheld gameplay. Rise, hunt, and rule, on the go!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably then, this will get it bumped up from Steam Deck Playable to Steam Deck Verified. They don't go into much detail on what's changed for the Steam Deck, which hopefully they will in some proper update notes when it arrives. If this does bring some decent controller improvements, it will be overall better for all players on Desktop too.</p>

      <title>RNG JAM is an upcoming NBA Jam inspired arcade-styled basketball game with roguelite chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an interface that looks rather inspired by Balatro in many parts, RNG JAM from bryanthaboi will bring arcade styled basketball with roguelite chaos. <em>The game will have Native Linux support.</em></p>
<p>More about it from the developer: "Are you tired of predictable (and let’s be honest, predatory) sports games?<br/>
RNG JAM smashes together the energy of arcade basketball with the relentless replayability of a roguelite — then sprinkles in some high-stakes sports betting (purely fictional) for flavor. It’s 2-on-2 hoops meets calculated chaos. Every match is a fresh gamble, every run a wild ride."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vChJbw-Wz9U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4dd5d00cbe0e06584b4f704578b14b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vChJbw-Wz9U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2-on-2 Arcade Basketball - Fast-paced retro-style basketball inspired by NBA Jam.</li>
<li>Roguelite Chaos - Each run starts with a new team, new challenges, and new risk.</li>
<li>High-Stakes Betting - Place bets between quarters and turn risk into reward.</li>
<li>Powerups &amp; Upgrades - Boost your team's stats with in-game currency between matches.</li>
<li>Dynamic Difficulty - CPU teams get sweatier the better you do. Stay sharp.</li>
<li>No Microtransactions - All gameplay content is earned. No in-game purchases, ever.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer has been regularly posting update videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bryanthaboi/videos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (and now their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BOISCLUBGAMES/videos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">newer channel</a>).</p>
<p>One to watch for sure! I look forward to juicing up my team is some ridiculous ways.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clonizer is a fresh tactical roguelike deck-builder about making and managing clones, and attempting to colonize and take over the universe. It's just launched with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>This one looks like it has a really nice mixture of strategy and a bit of comedy, with some pretty amusing combinations you can do with the deck-building. They're also planning multiple free content upgrades now it has been released to add in new content including cards, events, missions, planets and more. No play-through is the same the developer said as you "travel through the procedurally generated galaxy, complete assigned missions on alien planets, encounter eccentric events, trade with opportunistic shopkeepers and parasitic life forms".</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>

<li>Explore procedurally-generated planets with countless combinations of missions, layouts, and difficulties!</li>
<li>Craft a deck unique to you with upgradable cards, powerful bonuses and peculiar blueprints!</li>
<li>Master hex-based tactics against strange aliens.</li>
<li>Specialize your Clonees to aid in your journey against broken Faultees.</li>
<li>Obtain cards from different departments and divisions, each with their own theme and mechanics.</li>
<li>Trade with parasitic aliens and deal with gone-rogue Clonees in bizarre encounters.</li>
<li>Unlock new cards, spaceships, customization options, higher challenges and more!</li>

      <title>Electronic music rhythm game Spin Rhythm XD recently added Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spin Rhythm XD is a homage to classic arcade rhythm games (Guitar Hero, DDR), with a modern aesthetic and soundtrack. Earlier in April they also put up an official Native Linux version with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1058830/view/517458075240628314" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update 1.5</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck / Linux + Switch version upgrade</p>
<p>- We are doing actual Linux builds now so customs should in theory be a bit easier to manage<br/>
- Deck now supports proper multi-touch<br/>
- Visual touch panels now appear over gameplay and can be customised in the options menu<br/>
- MIDI DJ gear is now available on Steam Deck (and Linux)! Get your decks out, people!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spin Rhythm XD is big on customisation, with an included level editor and a suite of accessibility features, unlockable wheel skins and more. Fight your way to the top of the global leaderboards to become the best in the rhythm dimension. Check out the original 1.0 trailer below to see more, it looks like good fun:</p>

      <title>The latest Marvel Rivals update is causing problems on Linux - here&#39;s a quick workaround</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel Rivals has been updated with Season 2 by NetEase Games which brings in a new experimental shader compiler mode and other new content. However, it's causing problems for Desktop Linux players where nothing appears after hitting play.</p>
<p>Tested across Proton 9.0-4, Proton Experimental and GE-Proton 9-27 nothing appears. For now, you can work around it. What you need to do is tell the game you're running a Steam Deck. Go into the game Properties in Steam and put this in the launch options box:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Ensure you spell it correctly with the capitals "SteamDeck". You <em>won't</em> get the launcher, as this skips it, but at least for now on Desktop Linux you'll still be able to play.</p>
<p>I've added my own Proton log file to the Valve Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8300" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a> for it. Hopefully Valve will be able to track down the problem and fix it in Proton. There's a post on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/800059664763040983/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam forum</a> talking about the problem too.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor gets a release date and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a whole lot of space dwarf action going on lately. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor now has a release date for the 1.0 release and we have new footage on the upcoming Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core too.</p>
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, the bullet heaven survivor-like thingy spin-off, will be releasing the 1.0 update on September 17th, 2025. It will come with a new major feature teased with "Gear", although they're not giving much info just yet they said it's "not just a minor tweak" but a " brand-new system that will shake up the meta layer" and teased more to come.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EDnQNFn6vIk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fcbb04e80e56f593ba628525fc07ea9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EDnQNFn6vIk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><div class="itemdb_embed"><p><strong><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/itemdb/app/40796/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a></strong><p class="plain-list-title">Official links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/">Steam</a></li></ul></p></div></p>
<p>Additionally, we also have new footage for the upcoming rogue-lite action spin-off of Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. This takes the basics of the original Deep Rock Galactic that you know and love, but mixes it up into a 1-4 player co-op experience that's different each time and build up a new character as you go through each play-through.</p>
<p>They're going to start closed alpha testing for this one sometime soon.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eq303OLkBkY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/702c4069251a5476e22850cfa8f4b792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eq303OLkBkY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm thoroughly excited for Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. This is going to be a good one.</p>

      <title>Smash-hit drug sim Schedule I plans full Steam Deck support, will use the Steam Deck as the &#34;performance benchmark&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Schedule I is high up on my wishlist to eventually play-through, thankfully being in Early Access I've got plenty of time to get to it and it's only going to get better with full Steam Deck support planned.</p>
<p>What is Schedule I? It's an expansive drug-dealing sim that has seen an explosion in popularity on Steam. Released into Early Access on March 24th, sees hundreds of thousands of players on it each day.</p>
<p>Buried at the bottom of the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/503947989263319048" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm also looking into improving optimization. I'd like to get Steam Deck officially supported as soon as possible, so that'll act as my performance benchmark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great way to do it. The Steam Deck has set hardware, so using it as your device to optimise against will bring benefits for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dUxiQ1qN0rg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c24ab0fd5bcef71cc91bd53e1389284.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manufacture - Produce a range of drugs to satisfy your customers, each one with it's own unique production process. Discover special recipes to create new drug variants with special properties.</li>
<li>Distribute - Walk, skate or drive throughout the grungy west-coast city of Hyland Point to get product into the hands of customers. Hire dealers to handle distribution for you.</li>
<li>Expand - Purchase new properties and hire employees to expand the scope and scale of your operations. Work with suppliers to build a fully automated production and distribution chain.</li>
<li>Fight - This is a dangerous line of work - you'll have to contend with increasing law enforcement, as well as deadly cartel competitors. Fight with fists, melee weapons or firearms.</li>
<li>Work Together - A growing empire needs skilled management. Reach new heights in co-op multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's been so popular that the publisher of Drug Dealer Simulator 1 &amp; 2, Movie Games S.A., had to release a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1708850/view/535472473750111401" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> after various news reports of a lawsuit against Schedule I continued to spread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Gamers,<br/>
<br/>
We’d like to address your Schedule I / Drug Dealer Simulator publication and share some facts regarding the situation.<br/>
<br/>
1. <strong>There is no lawsuit.</strong><br/>
2. It is not our intention to prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game.<br/>
3. There is an investigation into the nature of similarities between the games since a preliminary legal analysis indicated there might have been an infringement.<br/>
4. The analysis and investigation were necessary in the light of repeating opinions that the games are very similar. By not investigating it, Movie Games, being a publicly traded company, could face severe consequences for negligence.<br/>
5. The above was communicated only via ESPI, a stock market communication system, where we are obligated to publish such information for full transparency. Not publishing it would also be a case of negligence. From there it was picked up by the media and, in some cases, wrongly reported as a lawsuit.<br/>
6. The above is handled only by Movie Games, the publisher, not Byterunners, the developer of Drug Dealer Simulator. The developer is not involved in it whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
There is no ill will towards TVGS. We even mailed them best wishes shortly before the release, when the game was already huge, but before the investigation was deemed necessary. However, we are obligated to perform this investigation, act accordingly to the scope of the infringement if it is confirmed, and inform the public about it via ESPI.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Movie Games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of all the reports both Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and 2 went down into Overwhelmingly Negative recent user reviews on Steam.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors free Square Enix SaGa cross-over DLC, another free update and cross-save out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors just had two entirely free content drops! The first is a free DLC cross-over with Square Enix's SaGa series, along with a chicken-themed free update.</p>
<p>The free DLC, Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama, brings with it 12 new playable characters. There's also over 16 new weapons and a new Glimmer game mechanic. As the devs explained: "40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the SaGa series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there's a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of SaGa gets represented!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vrb7lTnklrw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d8267bf4f42e5c5d6d2f7a36012f8a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vrb7lTnklrw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for why it's free? Paperwork and legal issues. As they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paperwork. It took a very long time to sort out the paperwork for this collab, and it would have been twice as hard to get the licence if there had been any money exchange involved. That's simply how it works for big companies; even when the creatives on both sides just want to do it, like it has been the case for this and all other Collabs, there are a lot of hoops to go through because IP is serious business and a lot of different departments have to get involved when talking about money.<br/>
So we just did it the easy way, and in a way everyone wins: I got to have fun with SaGa, SaGa gets some more visibility, you get free content :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cross-save across PC, Xbox, Android and iOS is also live now. You might notice that PlayStation is missing and they explained that they've "run into a legal issue on PlayStation we weren't aware of that requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to".</p>
<p>As for the other free update, The Coop, that's also out now that brings in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A chicken-themed update called The Coop</li>
<li>New relic that lets you speed up the game!</li>
<li>New stage, character, weapon, darkana</li>
<li>8 new Achievements</li>
<li>2 new Adventures with 6 chapters each:
	<ul>
<li>“To End an Ice Age” for the base game</li>
<li>“Tides of the Foscari” for the Tides of the Foscari DLC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Vampire Survivors has Native Linux support (not advertised) and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Egosoft reveal the big free Diplomacy update for X4: Foundations due out in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Egosoft have revealed that their expansive space sim X4: Foundations is getting another major upgrade named Diplomacy, scheduled to arrive some time this year.</p>
<p>This follows on from another major update earlier this year, which overhauled the flight model to bring improvements to how ships handle depending on their size, weight and engine configuration.</p>
<p>Diplomacy is going to be a free update for the base game, so no DLC required for it. They said it will "introduce new strategic elements, allowing players to engage in diplomacy like never before". As for what you'll get it brings the Embassy, a new facility where Diplomats can be brought together to represent their various factions. Plus you'll get access to Agents, who can be deployed on independent assignments to achieve diplomatic objectives within the X universe. Egosoft said these new tools will allow you to "influence alliances and rivalries alike, shaping the political and economic balance of the galaxy".</p>

      <title>Apocalypse Express is a challenging train-combat management roguelike with a demo you need to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/build-a-train-to-expand-your-deck-and-fight-off-bandits-in-the-demo-for-fogpiercer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fogpiercer</a> isn't the only upcoming train combat game around, with Apocalypse Express getting a demo now too but they're both wildly different and worth trying. Apocalypse Express is just chaos and I want more. The demo was tested with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>With real-time combat it gets pretty intense in this one as you're running through you train between different modules to activate them, repair them and directly control them all while your train is steaming towards the next station. It's thoroughly challenging when you've got numerous cars firing at you and flying bombs coming towards you that you're trying to take down with a big turret — and then the signal alarm goes off, so you need to run through your train to swap tracks before crashing through something.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3gtMTCfhU2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7c30adff0168ed83acf850805d78165.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3gtMTCfhU2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's great. I really want a lot more of this one. A demo truly worth checking out. The Early Access release is due later this year but no firm date is set for it.</p>

      <title>Cinnamon desktop from Linux Mint gets easier for other distros to package</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The March 2025 development round-up blog post from Linux Mint covers some interesting changes coming to the popular Linux distribution, like making packaging the Cinnamon desktop easier for other distributions.</p>
<p>Mint's Clement Lefebvre notes they're changing their versioning of the JavaScript engine that powers the Cinnamon desktop to match the Mozilla JavaScript engine it uses. They'll now be updating it indepedently to bring various improvements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updates can happen more frequently and efficiently.</li>
<li>New JavaScript engine improvements can be added without waiting for a full Cinnamon release.</li>
<li>The desktop environment can work with multiple versions of the JavaScript engine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they said the change will "benefit Linux distributions like Debian and Ubuntu, making it easier for them to ship Cinnamon without having to maintain multiple versions of the Mozilla JavaScript engine".</p>
<p>Sounds like a great change.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/738453301744271333gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Additionally the blog post notes how searching for files in Nemo, the Mint file manager, has been improved along with a new filter being added "to find files using regular expressions matching their filenames".</p>
<p>Cinnamon on Wayland continues to see improvements too. They're currently working on adding support for keyboard layouts and input methods to Cinnamon in Wayland, which should hopefully be in the next release.</p>
<p>On top of that they said that LMDE 7 (Linux Mint Debian Edition), which will be based on the next version of Debian Stable, will come with full support for OEM installations. Making it easier to be pre-installed on computers sold by various vendors.</p>

      <title>Civilization VII version 1.2 will let you play forever, adds &#34;Teams Multiplayer&#34; and more major changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization VII version 1.2 is due out April 22, and with it Firaxis Games are once again solving numerous complaints players have about the game, and it all sounds really positive. Looks like they may turn things around after the thoroughly mixed launch.</p>
<p>For people who want to appreciate all they've built for longer, 1.2 will allow you to tick the "Just One More Turn…" option which continues the game past the end of the Modern Age. Firaxis said doing this will enable you to "complete the steps for other victories, get the cinematics, and experiment with your empire if you just want to see it play out" and go through the Legacy Path achievements. In future, they're looking to expand this mode some more too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21203972241744270303gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Resources have been tweaked as well. Ten new resources will be added, all with their own narrative events. They've also changed how resources appear with a "newly added randomized Resource generation system" making them more "variable" that should "make exploration, trade, and strategy feel a lot more unique from Age to Age and game to game".</p>
<p>There's also improvements to population growth, a Teams Multiplayer system from past Civ games enabling you to share:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Map visibility.</li>
<li>Relationships, war status, and alliance status with other leaders.</li>
<li>And most importantly, victory – when one player wins, their whole team wins!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus some other highlights coming:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Queuing</strong>: Selecting a Tech or Civic deeper in the tree will queue up the pre-requistite nodes for you automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Repair All</strong>: Added a “Repair All” option when choosing Production in Settlements.</li>
<li><strong>Fewer Natural Disasters</strong>: Reduced the frequency of natural disasters across light and moderate settings.</li>
<li><strong>Map Generation (Coastal Erosion)</strong>: Improved coastal erosion on Continents Plus, Continents, Shuffle, and Terra Incognita map types to help break up coastlines more, especially near the poles.</li>
<li><strong>Bug Fixes, UI Polish, and Quality-of-Life Improvements</strong>: We’re always improving what’s already in the game, and you’ll get exact details whenever the full Update Notes are released.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers said they're also actively working on auto-explore, advanced game setup options, new map types and sizes and Steam Workshop support for future updates.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.1 will make Indiana Jones: The Great Circle playable on older AMD GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Ray Tracing is a requirement to run Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, a change has been merged into RADV (AMD Vulkan driver) for Mesa to get it working on older AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>The request from developer Natalie Vock noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Various people have been playing Indiana Jones: The Great Circle with RADV_PERFTEST=emulate_rt on GFX9/GFX10. RT support is required to launch the game, and performance is okay even with emulation, so enable it by default to make the game playable for everyone running older (GFX8-10*) GPUs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>*This includes GPUs released all the way back in 2014 covering the Volcanic Islands, Polaris and Vega series. So that's the likes of the Radeon R9 285, Radeon RX 480 and Radeon 520/530 + Radeon RX 530/550/570/580.</em></p>
<p>As of 15 hours ago, the change has been merged into RADV and so it should be available in the upcoming Mesa 25.1 release. This means the game will be playable on some pretty old GPUs, although performance may not be amazing, at least it will work now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13576002361744269694gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Mesa 25.1 is due for release potentially sometime around May 7th. That's when the final release candidate is scheduled, which may turn into the final release.</p>

      <title>Do screeching doughnuts and mow enemies down with saw blades in Driveloop: Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Driveloop: Survivors is another attempt to blend the survivor-like bullet heaven whatchamacallit genre made popular by Vampire Survivors with vehicles. It's out now in Early Access so I took it for a spin. <em>Disclosure: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>The problem they have, like every other coming along doing this, is how are they actually setting themselves apart? I wanted to find out, since I do love the genre and how easy it is to get into and have a blast when you don't have a whole lot of time. And I just love building up a character full of ridiculous weapons or powers, or this case, a vehicle.</p>
<p>I've played through <em><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/pizza-delivery-bullet-heaven-pest-apocalypse-is-hilarious-chaos-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pest Apocalypse</a></em> which had the really frantic and fun delivery side to it, and<em> <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/earl-vs-the-mutants-is-choatic-survivor-like-fun-with-vehicles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl vs. the Mutants</a> </em>which was pretty good but not particularly filled with content. At least with Driveloop: Survivors, it already seems like it nicely hits the mark.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7SwkboaLN9o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ba83df8f81e00fc861600888471a4ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7SwkboaLN9o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit that sets it apart is that it's arenas are supposed to be inspired by a post-apocalypse take on real locations, not that you'll be paying much attention to that while kicking up dust and mowing down various enemies.</p>
<p>I must admit that doing doughnuts with saw blades poking out of each side of my vehicle, while a rotating laser and machine gun turret blow enemies away, along with fire blowing out the back of the vehicle was thoroughly satisfying.  Plus, on top of the per-level weapons and upgrades, during a run you also rescue extra crew for your vehicle to get extras, that feels a bit like the rescue system in the pretty popular <em>Yet Another Zombie Survivors</em>.</p>
<p>Getting random events thrown in is a nice touch too, giving you more ways to earn extras. The first one I saw was a good one too, getting you to drive through a bunch of way-points as quickly as possible making it suddenly feel like a crazy racing game.</p>
<p>The developers of this one at least seem to understand what made Vampire Survivors popular — how ridiculous it gets when you're fully upgraded. You just get to unleash total chaos.</p>
<p>No issues at all on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, even on the Low graphics setting once it gets going the performance keeps it quite a bit <em>below</em> 30FPS and doesn't feel great so right now it's going to need optimisations before recommending there. One mark against it as well is that it does not currently support Steam Cloud so your saves are per-device.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience an irresistible blend of relentless survivor-like action and strategic top-down twin-stick shooting.</li>
<li>Pilot stylish combat cars with a slew of customisation options and unique skill trees to progress through.</li>
<li>Explore decimated versions of Paris and Berlin, with more locations to come post-launch, on a world tour of wreckage!</li>
<li>Unleash a wild arsenal of weapons and special abilities on the robot hordes, and recruit crew members to add another edge to your combat car's killing capabilities!</li>
<li>Used earned currency to pimp your ride, equip some seriously stylish customisation options, or opt for run-altering abilities!</li>
<li>Crank up the difficulty with multiple levels and gameplay modifiers – bigger risks, bigger payouts!</li>
</ul>

      <title>DUCKSIDE from tinyBuild may get BattlEye Anti-Cheat enabled for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently switching over from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye for DUCKSIDE, tinyBuild have confirmed they're now looking to enable it for players on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>What is it? Pretty simple really. Think of Rust but you're a Duck. An open world survival game that features PVP, PVE, crafting, base building and hat wearing ducks that wield weapons.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M4geIJlIAco"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/990c57901cb05b649cb87926e017328b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M4geIJlIAco" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the Steam forum one of their developers <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2682580/discussions/0/4349988265830898341/?ctp=3#c598523295548114676" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DUCKSIDE has had anti-cheat enabled since it launched into Early Access, we did recently change from EAC to Battleye however and are now looking to enable proton support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked why it wasn't enabled before, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not as easy as just flicking a switch seemingly. We've tested Proton support through both of our AC systems and they both exhibited some unexpected issues (literally not launching), so we're trying to get to the bottom of that and resolve the issue before we can confidently state that proton is supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting, as we've seen a few developers over time note it's not been as simple as it's supposed to be to enable Linux support for Easy Anti-Cheat or BattlEye. Both of which do support Native Linux games and Windows games run through Proton, just not at the Kernel-Level.</p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble releases May 8 and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SEGA have revealed that Sonic Rumble, their attempt at a sorta-of racing Battle Royale, is scheduled to release on May 8. It's also Steam Deck Verified, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/sonic-rumble-is-steam-deck-verified-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already wrote about earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder: it does use a Kernel Level Anti-Cheat called Uncheater that's noted on the Steam page, which seems to be some variant of XIGNCODE3. Thankfully, it's not using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) like a few others recently, which only seems to allow the Steam Deck on some sort of hardware whitelist, so Desktop Linux players should hopefully not have any problems. See more compatibility on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>Original trailer below:</p>

      <title>Become a pirate captain in Red Rogue Sea that combines FTL and deckbuilding with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Red Rogue Sea is one high up on my wishlist! After being completely hooked by FTL: Faster Than Light when it originally released, I'm always keen to see more like it and now a demo is available.</p>
<p>I originally wrote about this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/red-rogue-sea-looks-like-a-deck-building-pirating-version-of-ftl-faster-than-light/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in October 2024</a> and the developer has since put up an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3200220/discussions/0/600775246650312791/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> to give a bit more detail on what to expect from it. Noting that it's <em>obviously</em> inspired by the classic FTL: Faster Than Light for the main gameplay loop. But, it also adds in a deckbuilding mechanic as one of the main elements. The combat is turn-based, with a narrative that "incorporates light RPG elements through event-driven storytelling" with a story that unfolds via these events.</p>
<p>There's also a newer longer trailer to give you a good glimpse of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c3zGUni-wZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02e72ff8b010981da8749e195b2711a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c3zGUni-wZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new demo only has a Windows version currently, so you'll need to run it via Proton (I tested it working with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>). However, the FAQ notes clearly that Linux and Steam Deck will be supported.</p>
<p>Nice to see more games made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> too.</p>

      <title>Cosy floating island decoration game Twinkleby revealed by Meadow and Shelter devs Might and Delight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Might and Delight have revealed Twinkleby, a new cosy decoration game where you map out an archipelago of floating islands and build dioramas for a society of spacefaring neighbours. Much like their previous games it will have Native Linux support (confirmed in their recent newsletter).</p>
<p>Here's what they said about it in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Twinkleby, you will furnish your Victorian dollhouses and the gardens with an ever-expanding collection of decoration pieces. As you play, flying boats arrive to drop off new residents who make themselves at home on your islands.</p>
<p>These peculiar characters will interact with your creations and each other. They all have personalities of their own, and you need to figure out how to make them happy, because they’ll make sure to reward you for it.<br/>
Travel further into the floating archipelago, unlock bigger islands and build larger neighbourhoods to attract more cute and curious residents.</p>
<p>As you progress in the game, you will unlock backdrops and seasons for your island creations and receive new colours and variations for your furniture. While playing, you also transform the music by changing the weather and seasons in your own little corner of the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build neighbourhoods and decorate a variety of lush, floating islands with your growing collection of items.</li>
<li>Furnish your houses to attract new cute residents that will make themselves at home. If you make them happy, they'll reward you.</li>
<li>Choose the weather, season and backdrop for your colourful diorama and hear how the music changes with your choices for the scenery.</li>
<li>Collect the shooting stars known as Stellars and spend them in Molligan’s Antiques on whatever catches your eye.</li>
<li>Enjoy a cosy and peaceful gameplay in a widespread, floating archipelago without timed goals or lose conditions.</li>

      <title>Cute life sim Little Sim World comes to Early Access on May 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer .Gravity announced recently that Little Sim World will be entering Early Access on May 1st, and it appears it will also get Linux / Steam Deck support. The Steam page has updated system requirements to note Linux support, and their official <a href="https://littlesimworld.com/faqs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> states it too. Although it's not entirely clear if that support will be ready in time for Early Access.</p>
<p>More about it: "Little Sim World is a 2D life sim made with love by an indie team who’ve always dreamed of building a cosy little world you could truly call your own. We surveyed over 10,000 hardcore sim fans to find out what they wanted in a life simulation game, and we've packed Little Sim World with all the must-have features! Explore the streets of Little London, decorate your dream home, meet lovely (and sometimes odd) locals, and live your life however you choose!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="itXTHJpXIvA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1066735f0b664aa36ad21d0d71258c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/itXTHJpXIvA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer noted how this game is "focused on the RPG aspects and customizing a singular character". You can have multiple characters but each will have their own world. Each character is highly customizable from personality traits to your face and hairstyle too. As for how it differs from other similar games like The Sims the developer noted a couple differences:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No loading screens when moving around the world.</li>
<li>The player isn’t bound to their house.</li>
<li>Furniture and the character can be edited substantially more e.g. through custom colours.</li>
<li>Almost all objects in the world are interactable in a meaningful way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, there is a main story to follow along too and online multiplayer support for up to five players.</p>
<p>The game has been supported via their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/littlesimworld" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Patreon</a> for quite a while, which seems to be doing well with 1,724 members.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to fix Monster Hunter Wilds on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A recent update to Monster Hunter Wilds has been causing problems for players on Linux platforms including SteamOS / Steam Deck. Valve has now put out an update to Proton Hotfix to work around it.</p>
<p>For some specifics — the latest major update to Monster Hunter Wilds (Ver. 1.010.00.00) also updated the version of DirectStorage used, which then caused black screens and freezing issues when played via Proton.</p>
<p>An update <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/2435" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">landed</a> in VKD3D-Proton, the layer that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for Proton. Valve pulled it into the special Proton Hotfix version, and have now set it as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=28374582" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">default</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds. So the next time you reload Steam it will pick it up, unless you've forced a specific version of Proton (in that case uncheck the compatibility box).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14119961391744200545gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14119961391744200545gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even though on Steam Deck the performance is quite poor, and to get it working somewhat okay you need to really mess with the visual quality, it's still proving to be quite popular. It was 25th most-played over the last month on Steam Deck but 45th over the last week.</p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos Remaster out now on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now and exclusive to the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> store, Croc Legend of the Gobbos returns with a Remaster from Argonaut Games, bringing the classic back with many modern enhancements. One I missed from last week, you'll need Wine / Proton to run it on Linux so to make it easier you can use the likes of Heroic Games or Lutris.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YHeMqKoO4pA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d41ee4603dbc504ed9182660ca55b84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YHeMqKoO4pA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Jez San OBE, who originally founded Argonaut in 1982, expressed his enthusiasm about the revival: "Bringing the Argonaut name back after twenty years away has been an amazing experience. Argonaut was always about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in gaming. I’m excited to see how the relaunched Argonaut Games builds on that legacy, starting with the Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Classic Returns</strong></p>
<p>Originally released in 1997 for the original Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PCs, Croc Legend of the Gobbos captured the hearts of players worldwide with its charming protagonist and imaginative worlds. Now, nearly three decades later, this beloved title from Argonaut Games is making a triumphant return with stunning new visuals, updated quality-of-life features, and an array of exciting additions that are sure to delight both longtime fans and new players alike. </p>
<p><strong>Enhanced for Modern Platforms</strong></p>
<p>The remastered Croc Legend of the Gobbos brings the heartwarming journey of Croc, the humble and courageous little crocodile, back to life with vibrant, high-definition graphics, a modern controls and camera system, and refined gameplay mechanics. Players will once again embark on a delightful quest across a series of imaginative worlds, running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail-spinning to rescue the adorable Gobbos from the nefarious Baron Dante’s grasp. Navigate Croc through beautifully recrafted levels brimming with quirky enemies, puzzles, and hidden secrets to save his adoptive Gobbo family from captivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exclusive GOG release on PC comes with the original version too. It's not been made clear why it's exclusive to GOG.</p>

      <title>Fast-paced car combat game FUMES has an awesome demo worth playing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FUMES is simply awesome. Bringing back retro fast-paced car combat that feels like the classic Interstate '76 and Twisted Metal meets Mad Max only more crazy with boss battles and all sorts. <em>It runs perfectly on Linux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with Proton 9.0-4</a> tested in the demo.</em></p>
<p>As the developer describes: "FUMES is a single-player game inspired by the golden era of vehicular combat genre. Straight-forward, fast paced, intense gameplay. Get into the car, slap some weapons on and cruise twisted wastes."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11360991151744116145gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>With the demo live on Steam, the developer keeps expanding and improving it based on player feedback and it's a demo you simply must try out. After playing it, I can safely say this is going right into the top section of my Steam Wishlist as I really can't wait to see more from it.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Drive customizable cars. Equip them with weapons.</li>
<li>Experience driving physics inspired by old rally games.</li>
<li>Encounter waves of enemies. Get involved in the chase of destruction.</li>
<li>Deliver suspicious packages while escaping from greedy chasers.</li>
<li>Defeat the fastest racers of the wastelands in off road challenges.</li>
<li>Fight with giant bosses - monstrosities on wheels.</li>
<li>Customize your car. Choose loadout to fit your combat style. Slap some stickers on.</li>
<li>Earn new cars and parts by beating bosses.</li>
<li>No loading screens. No fast travel. Just use your car.</li>
<li>Slow down after the fight, go for a ride and inhale the FUMES.</li>
<li>Get lost in the desert. Wander endless, procedural environments.</li>
<li>Listen to the original, guitar-heavy soundtrack.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Legacy (not to be confused with Team Fortress 2 Classic) is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have truly opened the floodgates for Team Fortress 2 mod teams when they added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TF2 to the Source SDK</a>, with Team Fortress 2 Legacy announced for a Steam release. Not to be confused with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-classic-is-coming-to-steam-thanks-to-valve-adding-tf2-to-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2 Classic which is also coming to Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Appearing live on Steam with a Coming Soon page today, Team Fortress 2 Legacy is described as "a project that provides some post-2008 and pre-release Team Fortress 2 features on pre-2008 Team Fortress 2 gameplay basis, with quality-of-life features and improvements made by community as well as with our own hands".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20632353731744107360gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It will include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced third person gamemode that provides a new comfortable way for old gameplay mechanics!</li>
<li>Lightning fast Deathmatch gamemode that changes the way how you played Team Fortress before!</li>
<li>4-Team gamemode. Now you can play as YLW (Yellow) and GRN (Green) Teams with corresponding item and cosmetic colors!</li>
<li>Performance enhancements (now even old MediaTek can handle it)!</li>
<li>Expanded options for creating custom weapons and cosmetics.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no current release date for it as the developers said they are <em>hoping</em> to have it ready this year. But they're not rushing it to ensure it works well.</p>

      <title>Boomer shooter Gravelord adds controller support and gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gravelord is an Early Access boomer shooter from Fatbot Games, creators of the dungeon crawler series Vaporum, and the latest update makes it more accessible with it now Steam Deck Verified thanks to the addition of controller support.</p>
<p>They said that controller support was the most requested feature since launch. In addition, there's now a weapon wheel enabling you to really quickly see what you've got and swap between all the weapons.</p>
<p>Check out their new developer video on the update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GnEnyGd-uz8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2c7ab5741e58d7ebfa4a9baaf619d7a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GnEnyGd-uz8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from the Steam page):</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Proven Boomer Shooter Formula:</strong></h4>
- Run &amp; jump around levels like a complete badass.<br/>
- Beat the living hell out of enemies and blow them up with powerful weapons like there's no tomorrow.<br/>
- Abstract level design heavily aimed at fun and engaging gameplay rather than realism.<br/>
- Figure out how to beat each level and find its deviously hidden secrets.<br/>
<h4><strong>So What's the Special Sauce?</strong></h4>
<p>- Badass Protagonist: We're bringing back the sassy, witty one-liners like Duke Nukem mixed with the rotten charisma of Frankenstein's monster.<br/>
- Use your Spectral Shovel to get around quickly and confuse enemies.<br/>
- Collect Tarot Cards to significantly boost your power level and combat options.<br/>
- Upgrade your weapons to unlock additional fire modes and synergies.<br/>
- Make your own levels with the integrated Level Editor! (This will officially come out with the full release of the game.)</p>

<p>It's currently rated Very Positive on Steam after releasing into Early Access in January 2025.

      <title>SILENT HILL f gets rated Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see Valve getting more pre-release testing done for major games. SILENT HILL f has now been rated Steam Deck Playable. Be sure to also check out my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/steam-deck-verified-round-up-for-early-april-25-with-new-and-upcoming-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified round-up for early April 25</a> with new and upcoming games.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of time for the developer to get it bumped up to Verified since it doesn't even have a release date yet. Currently it's Playable due to some small text and requiring manual configuration of graphics options. Both that should hopefully be easy enough to solve.</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Party Pack 11 is on the way and Trivia Murder Party 3 teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jackbox Games just held their first Jackbox Direct event to detail what they're working on with Jackbox Party Pack 11 being announced with all-new games. Additionally, we got a tease of a standalone game Trivia Murder Party 3.</p>
<p>As far as we know it will have Native Linux support just like previous packs. The Jackbox Party Pack 11 will include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A fantasy-themed trivia game</strong> where teams collaborate to defeat trivia-obsessed monsters.</li>
<li><strong>A social deduction game</strong> that puts each player on trial, where clues are based on facts players share about themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A head-to-head joke writing game</strong> where players "ruin" wholesome concepts under the direction of a "bad to the bone" host.</li>
<li><strong>A sound-based game</strong> featuring new Jackbox technology where players record themselves and compete to make the best sound effects.</li>
<li><strong>A cozy drawing game</strong> where players create simple designs based on bizarre prompts. (Warning: May induce hunger!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Party Pack 11 will be available sometime in "fall 2025" at $29.99.</p>
<p>As for the standalone Trivia Murder Party 3 it will feature online matchmaking and you'll be able to play locally via a classic Jackbox Games room code. This next version is set in a summer camp and challenges players to outwit a serial killer on the loose, putting their smarts (and survival skills) to the test. It's due in Early Access sometime in "fall 2025".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xV1s_4EXWG0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ee8b1ba0b71ac6be72548c41eeeb650.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xV1s_4EXWG0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We took a break last year from the Party Pack franchise in order to innovate and deliver some long-requested products for fans, including The Jackbox Megapicker. We’re excited to focus our studio’s creativity and return to the Party Pack franchise. Party Pack 11 will feature five brand-new game concepts to bring the party game experience to another level," said Jackbox Games CEO Mike Bilder. "Trivia Murder Party 3 builds on the fan-favourite franchise by introducing online matchmaking alongside traditional local play via Jackbox room codes, connecting players both near and far. Launching in Early Access enables us to actively engage with our community and enhance the features they enjoy most."</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.6.1 brings numerous needed fixes for playing Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK is a Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11. It's part of what Proton uses to make Windows games run so well on Linux platforms including the SteamOS based Steam Deck. DXVK 2.6.1 is now available fixing up some big issues.</p>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed sparse buffer usage that was introduced in DXVK 2.6. This caused all sorts of driver issues that would cause hangs and instability on AMD Vega GPUs and others. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4763" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4763</a>)<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This may increase peak memory usage in some games again.</li>
<li>Worked around an RTSS bug that would cause the overlay to render incorrectly if the Vulkan swapchain uses an sRGB format. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4777" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4777</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4778" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4778</a>)</li>
<li>Worked around an issue where multisample resolves would lead to visual issues on Nvidia in certain Unity Engine games. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4817" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4817</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4818" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4818</a>)</li>
<li>Worked around an Intel ANV issue that would cause terrain to misrender in games such as <strong>Assassin's Creed Origins</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This driver bug was fixed in Mesa 25.0.3.</li>
<li>Worked around a RADV issue that would cause hangs on RDNA4 GPUs prior to Mesa 25.0.2.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Please keep your drivers up to date when using these newer GPUs.</li>
<li>Further improved render pass efficiency for tiling GPUs in some cases, especially if <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_load_store_op_none</code> is supported.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This change <strong>does not</strong> affect desktop GPUs in any meaningful way.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue with display mode handling on uncommon monitor setups. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4764" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4764</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed various issues with the SDL3 backend in dxvk-native. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4825" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4825</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4826" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4826</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility of MSVC builds with very old CPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4811" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4811</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed various minor issues that would cause Vulkan validation errors in rare scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Hitman 2</strong>: Worked around poor CPU-bound performance in certain areas. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4796" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4796</a>)<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This may slightly regress GPU-bound performance.</li>

      <title>Palworld publisher teams up with MythicOwl for car delivery adventure Truckful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MythicOwl have teamed up with Pocketpair Publishing, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently announced publishing arm of the Palworld developer</a>, for their upcoming game Truckful. The developer previously released the wonderful <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/planetiles-is-a-beautiful-blend-of-tetris-and-dorfromantik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Planetiles</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? Truckful is a single player car delivery adventure game based around completing errands and quests for villagers and uncovering the ancient mystery that surrounds the nearby old forest.<em> There's no release date for it yet.</em></p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3090810/view/535472473750111179" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned Pocketpair will be "providing game changing funding, publishing and marketing support to help us bring the best possible version of Truckful to you - the players" and that they "couldn't be happier with the chosen partner" enabling them to "deliver the best and most ambitious game we envisioned at the start".</p>
<p>They posted it along with a very short teaser:</p>

      <title>Twin Sails Interactive break off from Asmodee and Embracer to go independent</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some <em>hopefully</em> good industry news here. Twin Sails Interactive have officially broken away from Asmodee Group AB / Embracer to become independent. This follows a "strategic management buyout" with Twin Sails retaining their entire team.</p>
<p>The company was founded back in 2016 and was originally known as Asmodee Digital, serving as the Asmodee's video game division. They've published various tabletop adaptions including Terraforming Mars and Gloomhaven along with various indie games.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CJEgCTJ0V7A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80c21a435954049bb3e09fbd971e205a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CJEgCTJ0V7A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"This is an exciting new chapter for Twin Sails Interactive,” said Nicolas Godement, CEO of Twin Sails Interactive. “Our time within Asmodee provided us with invaluable experience, and we are grateful for the collaboration that helped shape our journey. Now, as an independent publisher, we move forward with confidence, ready to pursue our bold and energized vision for the future."</p>
<p>“At Twin Sails Interactive, we believe every game deserves dedicated expertise and care,” said Laurent Lichnewsky, Production Director. “That’s why each title is championed by a dedicated ‘Triforce’—a producer, brand manager, and game designer—who work closely with the developer to shape the game’s creative vision, a strong market positioning, and overall quality. From production oversight to porting, localization, and QA, we’re committed to delivering polished, high-impact experiences to players worldwide.”</p>
<p>"We will continue to champion creative titles with strong visual identities and passionate teams behind them", added Adrien Rotondo, Marketing Director. "Our goal is to work with our partner studios to create long-lasting game brands that grow through updates, new content, and new titles in the series”.</p>
<p>Last year,<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-companies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Embracer split off into three companies</a> which included Asmodee, with Asmodee being acquired by Embracer back in late 2021 with the acquisition being completed in March 2022. So they weren't under Embracer for that long, as Embracer continues trying to turn things around after facing years of problems resulting in selling off or splitting from various other developers and publishers.</p>

      <title>Build a train to expand your deck and fight off bandits in the demo for Fogpiercer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fogpiercer is a fresh and interesting take on deckbuilders, with you controlling a train that you build up and upgrade as you go.<em> It has Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> and a demo is now available.</em></p>
<p>Your train carriages make up your deck of cards so you could have a very different run each time you load it up. It all depends on what carriages you take with you and buy at stations during your run. When it comes to upgrade time, you can eventually get a whole stack of powerful cards to help the turn-based tactical battles.</p>
<p>The battles are really interesting too, since it's all based on positioning. You're controlling a train, so of course you're attached to the rails, but the enemy bandits are not. It's up to you to force them into the positions you want with your weapons and perhaps a little ramming or forcing them into something.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z9AJShGRpsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/33cf0624a229474bc5790d126f9d59fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z9AJShGRpsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo includes 1 driver, 1 locomotive and 3 carriages. Featuring over 47 unique cards and 18 modules that significantly change your playstyle, allowing you to create interesting builds on an endlessly-replayable dynamic tactical grid.</p>
<p>I've played through the demo and thought it was really great. Shooting right up into the top of my wishlist. Really want a whole lot more from this one, can't wait to see what all the extra carriages will let you do in the full release. Give this demo a go for sure.</p>

      <title>Master platforming with two characters at the same time in Ambidextro - from the dev of Pineapple on pizza</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some evil Witch has kidnapped the Queen's children. As the Royal Wizard, it's up to your to rescue them. The only problem is that the Queen is a bit brutal, and has cut you in half. You're a Wizard though, so apparently being cut in half is no big deal. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The developer calls it a "multi-player game for a single player", which is an interesting way to put it. Giving you 100 levels to conquer quickly, while your brain gets melted by trying to control the two characters together and escape each level. It's a thorough challenge and one that's really quite entertaining to run and jump through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dnuyOmAkmtw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4e0fd1121884d54042a5fc39f2aab55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dnuyOmAkmtw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Could an average player learn to control two Super-Mario-like characters at the same time?" is the question that inspired Alva Majo to develop Ambidextro. The answer is apparently yes. Unless you're me that is, because I'm terrible at it. Seriously, it's a fun game but really does challenge your attention and reflexes. It made me throw my controller down a couple of times when I was so-damn-close. Gets you feeling weirdly determined though, when you've gone from repeated fails to a split-second away from completing a level, resulting in needing just one more run.</p>
<p>With that damn level timer it's not just a question of speed but true skill too. One tiny misstep by one character, and you'll be mashing that restart button so hard. The level design is truly devilish at times too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-player game for a single player.</li>
<li>Control one character with each hand.</li>
<li>Make your two-halves meet before the time runs out.</li>
<li>100 levels to conquer.</li>
<li>Retro dark-fantasy atmosphere with a dungeon synth soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<p>About the developer: Majorariatto is a small Spanish-based indie studio made of mostly-solo developer Alva Majo, music composer Alejandro Maciá, and occasional collaborators; this time, pixel artist SunPixels. Majorariatto has been releasing and self-publising games since 2016 with Majotori. Their last title, Pineapple on pizza, was a short free game that went pretty viral, with almost a million downloads and hundreds of millions of views on YouTube and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over 20,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>Ambidextro has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods improve the new open source app with UI upgrades, Cyberpunk 2077 fixes and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I continue to be very excited about improvements to the cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app, to finally firmly plug the modding hole on Linux platforms including the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The app is ready for people to use with Stardew Valley, with other games still being worked on. Certain games like Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3 or Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord are currently locked behind a toggle as they're not quite ready.</p>
<p>With this release there's quite a few bug fixes but also some nice improvements to the interface too. Like it now showing in-progress collection installs in the left menu to be more clear. They've also re-organised the Library UI, as it was getting too cluttered and difficult to use on smaller screens (like the Steam Deck). So they've turned mods and collections into tabs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1591321881744029457gol1.png"/></p>
<p>In my own testing, the latest version also starts up on Linux a <em>lot</em> faster than before.</p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>More Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Files in mods from a Nexus Mods collection are now read-only to prevent users from accidentally breaking the collection by editing them.</li>
<li>Mods that are required as part of a Nexus Mods collection can now only be enabled or disabled using the collection toggle.</li>
<li>The toggle indicator for mods has been updated to explain better why a mod cannot be toggled when part of a collection. Clicking this indicator will now open the Installed Collection page.</li>
<li>Continued to refine the UI to make it more compact.</li>
<li>The "Optional" tab is now only shown for collections with optional mods.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the "Update available" pop-up to give more relevant advice depending on how the app was installed (Windows EXE, Linux AppImage, Linux Package Manager).</li>
<li>Updated the Load Order page to use the newer display technologies.</li>
<li>The "Advanced Install" option no longer shows a screen saying the mod is unsupported before showing the options to install files.</li>
<li>The view button on the games page will now open the last applied loadout rather than the first one that was created.</li>
<li>The "Login" button will no longer be disabled for a short time after clicking on it.</li>
<li>If a download fails during a collection installation, subsequent downloads will no longer be aborted.</li>
<li>Updated Nexus Mods links to the new format.</li>
<li>Updated Privacy Policy links.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a few instances where the app would not clean up empty directories on swapping loadouts or uninstalling.</li>
<li>In the Advanced Installer, the "Suggested" folder will now correctly show a name instead of a number.</li>
<li>The spine menu will now correctly show which loadout is active after the app starts up.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some Cyberpunk 2077 mod installers (FOMODs) would not trigger correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue preventing mods installed by FOMOD from being deleted/disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a critical bug that would cause data to be written to the wrong file when installing or removing mods that shared some identical files.</li>
<li>Fixed an error relating to "Duplicate Keys" when applying mods.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue re-indexing the game files after a game update, which could result in DLCs (e.g. REDmod, Phantom Liberty) being unintentionally deleted when applying a loadout.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where large files skipped during the indexing of the game were not properly tracked by the app, causing errors when applying a loadout.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Iron Village is a sweet super-casual city-builder and railway manager out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you prefer your games a bit cosier and sweeter perhaps Iron Village might be your next one to pick up. Especially if you like building and management sims. Distilling the genre down to something a bit more simple and easy to get into.</p>
<p>Since it's a more casual game, don't go in expecting a big challenge. It's more about setting it all up how you want, watching it all grow and continuing to build it all up.</p>
<p>As the developer explains: "Iron Village is a casual game offering building and management challenges in a fun and intuitive environment; start from scratch and with the help of your railway you can build houses, farms, warehouses, and more to create your basic village. Trade what your people make for other resources and gather gold to grow your village into a prospering town and grow the railway into a powerhouse. For your village to grow and prosper you must build houses for the community. You can open shops that turn raw resources into valuable goods. You need to clear farm fields to grow a variety of crops, from basic staples to exotic magical ingredients - and with time and experience, you may construct warehouses to store your resources and goods. Trading is an essential part of the game; resources and goods your villagers make can be turned into gold and you can trade for other resources that your villagers need. Gold can be used to invest in, and to expand, your village. You can unlock new types of goods and resources along the way, and with patience and skills create new opportunities to grow into a prospering town."</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Control Application (LACT) v0.7.3 brings configurable charts, improvements for AMD RDNA3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux GPU Control Application (LACT) continues being one of the best ways to control your AMD, NVIDIA or Intel GPU on a Linux system with version 0.7.3 out now with new features and improvements.</p>
<p>The first big one is that the charts window is now fully configurable. This means you can set whatever stats to show that you want, add and remove charts and much more. It's a nice quality of life improvement for the app.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17817087491744028278gol1.png"/></p>
<p>For AMD RDNA3 GPU owners, this is a big release for you too! It includes some workarounds to improve overclocking. Due to driver bugs it does things in a very specific order to work around them, until they're fixed in the drivers. So you should now be able to properly deal with custom power limits/fan curve/clocks on RDNA3.</p>
<p>An emergency reset option has been included, for if you mess up overclocking settings. And, additionally there's also now a Flatpak package.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA open sourced PhysX and Flow GPU code</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a nice win for open source, NVIDIA have now provided the PhysX and Flow GPU source code to expand what developers can do with it.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX/discussions/384" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on GitHub from NVIDIA developer Adam Moravanszky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the release of PhysX SDK 4.0 in December 2018, NVIDIA PhysX has been available as open source under the BSD-3 license—with one key exception: the GPU simulation kernel source code was not included.</p>
<p>That changes today.</p>
<p>We’re excited to share that the latest update to the PhysX SDK now includes all the GPU source code, fully licensed under BSD-3!</p>
<p>With over 500 CUDA kernels powering features such as rigid body dynamics, fluid simulation, and deformable objects, GPU PhysX represents one of the most advanced real-time simulation use cases of CUDA and GPU programming. We hope this release will be a valuable resource for learning, experimentation, and development across the community.</p>
<p>In addition, we’re also open-sourcing the full GPU compute shader implementation of the Flow SDK, our real-time, sparse grid–based fluid simulation library.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see what you build with it. Explore, experiment—and feel free to post issues or feedback right here on GitHub!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will be interesting to see what developers end up doing with this now it's all there. What do you think it might enable?</p>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition rated Steam Deck Verified - but still no official announcement that it exists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it still hasn't been announced yet, we've seen that Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition exists thanks to SteamDB and now its rating has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2738630/history/?changeid=28298036" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improved</a> to be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-hasnt-been-announced-yet-but-it-just-got-a-steam-deck-playable-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Over a week ago</a> it gained a Steam Deck Playable rating, so it appears recent hidden developments have enabled it to get re-tested by Valve ahead of an announcement to be Verified. <em>Nice to see for the upcoming game. </em></p>
<p>As a reminder: from what we do know it seems Aspyr Media are involved with it, thanks to their name clearly stated in the EULA notice. And we also know that Beamdog are <em><a href="https://x.com/BeamdogInc/status/1890121268034519371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not</a></em> involved with this one even though they did a bunch of previous Enhanced Editions for the original and other RPGs. We still know basically nothing <em>else</em> about it though for now. Hopefully an announcement will come soon.</p>
<p>Since it's Verified though, it should at the very least have good controller support and (hopefully) good performance.</p>

      <title>Run, jump and glide at blazing speed in Haste, the latest game from Landfall out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally called Haste: Broken Worlds and now just Haste, it's the latest game from Landfall (Content Warning, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, Clustertruck) that ensures you gotta go fast.</p>
<p>A Sonic-like? Well, sort-of. It's a high-speed third-person running game, set in a collapsing universe. It's an odd one to describe really. You're racing through various zones as quickly as possible, trying to build up speed by landing as perfectly as possible to boost yourself constantly across the map. The demo was impressive and good fun and now it's available with Native Linux support and rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dHoXrWIawxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0f652cf81173505d525539cc788e917e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dHoXrWIawxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Race through a variety of worlds, master your movement and use items and abilities to progress through each level before it falls apart around you. The game consists of ten Shards, each featuring a collection of procedurally generated levels that must be completed without fail to unlock the next. You’ll encounter challenges and characters on your journey, seeking answers about what lies behind the destruction, and how to escape it!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Third-person high-speed running gameplay.</li>
<li>10 Shards, each featuring a collection of procedurally generated levels that must be completed without fail to advance to the next Shard.</li>
<li>90+ Items that let you customize your build for each attempt to clear a Shard.</li>
<li>A story to explore and a lovable cast of characters to befriend.</li>
<li>Spectacular biomes and 4 different bosses to discover.</li>
<li>4 abilities to master.</li>
<li>An unlockable endless mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo did have an issue where alt+tab would just close the game. It's not clear if that's been solved yet. So keep that in mind for the release.</p>

      <title>Earthquakes, cockroaches and broken bones didn&#39;t stop the Hungry Horrors demo releasing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes developers put up blog posts talking about developing their game, but it's not every day you read about how they had to deal with earthquakes, cockroaches and broken bones. And yet, Clumsy Bear Studio still managed to get the Hungry Horrors demo out on Steam.</p>
<p>You can read all about what happened in <a href="https://clumsybearstudio.com/blog/post-008-launching-our-first-steam-demo.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their blog post</a>, which makes for quite a read. Thankfully, they're okay. So we can all enjoy what they've clearly put a bit of blood, sweat and tears into. A game I was already quite interested in from testing an earlier build <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/feed-the-demons-dont-fight-them-in-the-deckbuilder-hungry-horrors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>.</p>
<p>So what is it? Hungry Horrors is a culinary roguelite deckbuilder where you strategically cook and serve authentic traditional dishes to legendary monsters. Your deckbuilding skills and culinary decisions determine whether you successfully satisfy your monstrous guests or become their dinner. That's right. You don't fight the monsters, you cook for them. Your cards make up your dishes, just don't let them get too close.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Qu3xZbn114"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7eff493a3dbf15b055d4c438649f5c88.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Qu3xZbn114" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feed, Don't Fight - Gameplay focused on matching dishes to monsters' preferences, replacing traditional combat.</li>
<li>Legendary Monsters - Encounter iconic folklore creatures such as Jenny Greenteeth, Dullahan, and Glaistig.</li>
<li>Traditional Dishes - Serve authentic regional recipes like Bara Brith and Cranachan.</li>
<li>Strategic Deckbuilding - Build your deck using dishes, spices, herbs, and utensils for strategic depth.</li>
<li>Pixel-Art &amp; Music - Enjoy vibrant pixel art visuals and original whimsical music composed exclusively for the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really a unique spin on a deck-builder and definitely worth a go. Made with Godot it has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Oddventure blends Alice in Wonderland and EarthBound now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Like your RPGs a little on the weird side? Oddventure from developer Infamous Rabbit that's inspired by and blending a little Alice in Wonderland and EarthBound has finally entered Early Access. The game was crowdfunded on Kickstarter back in 2021, and the release arrives with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Oddventure is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending bittersweet comedy with dark humor and an innovative combat system involving the mood of each character. You'll be unravelling hidden secrets, facing off against bizarre foes, and discovering just how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EvjjRWJx9zw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/359bb3dbd5e68da05423ffe9810b3630.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EvjjRWJx9zw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Step into the twisted fairytale world of Oddventure, where every choice shapes a story like no other! Join Charlie, a rebellious and sharp-witted teen with a fiery temper and a streak of nihilism, as she embarks on a perilous quest to rescue her troublemaking brother, Bonzo. But the cursed kingdom of Luxia is no ordinary place, it’s riddled with eerie mysteries, unexpected consequences, and a darkness that lurks behind every fateful decision."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle Enemies – Classic turn-based combat with a twist; use the MOOD of each character! Every battle can have a different outcome.</li>
<li>Explore and Interact – Meet new people (or creatures). In this world, every character can be talked to and has something to say. Don't forget to check the objects surrounding your character, either.</li>
<li>Make Choices – Every decision matters. It’s up to the player to see how the story plays out and which of several endings they’ll come to face.</li>
<li>Solve Puzzles – Between battles, explore a world filled with cute and weird puzzles full of odd creatures.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually supported this myself on Kickstarter, so I can't wait to dive in. My key only arrived recently though, so I haven't yet had time to play it other than checking the Linux version works.</p>

<p>New since last covering includes: Mafia III: Definitive Edition (GOG), Gravity Circuit (Amazon), Paleo Pines (Amazon) and Clouds &amp; Sheep 2 (Amazon). I also forgot to actually put Let's Build a Zoo (Epic) in the table last week, so it's in there now. There's also Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and Minecraft Legends, but they're only for Xbox and the Microsoft Store which isn't usable in any way on Linux platforms.</p>
<p>Plenty more to come this month. I'll push out a new list each week as things change to keep you updated.</p>
<p>On top of all that you get access to various Cloud Games via Amazon Luna.</p>

      <title>Awesome auto-battler Mechabellum gets a free weekend, discount and update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My absolute favourite auto-battler Mechabellum will have a Free Weekend starting later today, it's one you definitely have to try as the battles just look awesome.</p>
<p>It works perfectly on Desktop Linux with the latest Proton 9.0-4, and has been running great since release. To go with the Free Weekend it's also on a 20% discount, and they just added in a huge new unit to the game. The new unit is the Abyss, a huge aerial unit that fires off a massive sweeping laser (and might be my new favourite unit).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6076794101743757136gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6076794101743757136gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mechabellum on Linux</em></p>
<p>This is also the start of Season 3, which runs through until July 3rd. Another major update is planned for May 22nd, which adds in another new unit — the single-target specialist unit Void Eye and an all-new Undo feature available across all game modes. Looking forward to that!</p>
<p>While I grew somewhat quickly bored of other auto-battling games, or they just died out (R.I.P Dota Underlords), Mechabellum feels like it's carved out something special here. The battles are just magic to watch unfold, with all the destruction. A great game for people who love strategy games but don't have hours and hours to put into them.</p>

<p>The developer also just recently teamed up with a new publisher, Dreamhaven, to help the developer continue to expand the game further.</p>
<p>Don't sleep on this one.</p>

      <title>Wildkeepers Rising blends survivor-like bullet-heavens with creature collection for lots of chaotic battles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now in Early Access on Steam, Wildkeepers Rising is one of the latest to attempt to put a new spin on the popularity of whatever genre we're calling things like Vampire Survivors today. <em>Note: key provided by Evolve.</em></p>
<p>Bullet heaven? Survivor-likes? Auto-attacking roguelite? Heck, I don't know but I'm going to play all of them. Something about this genre just has me hooked. Probably because I have so little free "me" time, and they're always easy to get into for a quick run around.</p>
<p>Wildkeepers Rising is another quite unique entry here, and one that (at least initially) feels a whole lot more like you're playing a mini-RPG epic. There's an actual background story, and the starting setup acts much more like a game that's much bigger than the auto-attacking genre it's in. The style of it is fantastic too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8179969481743681877gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8179969481743681877gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9536695731743681878gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9536695731743681878gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While most games in this genre just sort-of throw you into the thick of it, and expect you to understand them already, this is thoroughly different. You get a short story cut-scene, and then actual dialogue between characters before it sends you off into the world. What's really quite unique about this one, and how it helps evolve the whole genre, is the creature collection side of it. Not only are you levelling up and picking various character buffs and abilities, but you'll also be customising various Guardian creatures as you go along too.</p>
<p>During a run you'll come across various little shrines, where you can summon a Guardian creature from a list. These creatures then follow you around dealing damage to all the creatures around you. They each have their own health, and super ability that you manually activate. They can get knocked out, and then have their own individual timer to come back to life.</p>
<p>Active abilities you gain from the level up system can be given to either you, or your Guardians, and you can swap them around at any time. The ability swapping is only a small thing really but this change feels genuinely different and interesting. It's not just the active abilities either, on level up you'll also be picking character buffs between you and your creatures, so there's a <em>lot</em> of room to customise each run through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zEqR269udQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64663edfdd463b67d8076bf449cde188.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zEqR269udQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers said they only expect it to be in Early Access for "a few months" but they plan to add in new playable characters and Guardian creators to follow you, new environments, more enemy variety, more content for the story and so on. Definitely keen to see what this evolves into once it's properly complete. At least from my initial look, it has all the makings of another excellent game to add to your collection.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet Heaven </strong>| Shred thousands of monsters in bullet heaven runs.</li>
<li><strong>Creature Collector</strong> | Discover, tame, and train magical beasts.</li>
<li><strong>Runs &amp; Builds</strong> | Create team synergies with different Guardians.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelike Runs</strong> | Take runs with different Wildkeepers wielding different weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Progression</strong> | Unlock new Guardians and items and make them stronger between runs.</li>
<li><strong>RPG Elements</strong> | Discover a rich world of fantasy heroes and magical monsters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wildkeepers Rising works <em>great</em> on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>I also tested it on Steam Deck (LCD model) but it's a bit problematic here. Their graphics settings are just odd. There's only a single setting "Quality" and anything below "Epic" in that drop-down results in a really blurry picture. Even with it set to "Epic" the picture quality is still a bit too blurry. Performance seems okay enough, but they've clearly got work to do to make it properly Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Having a good time with this one. There's a whole lot of potential here, and even in the initial Early Access release there's a lot of fun to be had and a lot of charm to the style. I just hope they add in some proper progression into the game outside of the runs, and additionally once they add in a little more enemy variety it could be a must-have.</p>

      <title>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed gets a couple of Steam Deck fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed was already rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve, it's nice to see developers still making improvements to it. The original game released back 2010 for the Wii, with this remake arriving in September 2024.</p>
<p>Seems it didn't sell as well as hoped by THQ Nordic, a subsidiary of Embracer Group. In Embracer's earning report from November 2024 they <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1207-million/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> "The most notable new release, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, late in the quarter, was well received by players but initial digital sales were slower than expected". On Steam, it has less than a thousand user reviews but it does have a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1522160/view/542227873190117637" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> the notes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Excluded user settings from Steam Cloud saves; meaning Steam Deck and PC use separate user settings from now on.</li>
<li>Fixed initial start up resolution setting on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm quite thankful for that first one. Games should simply not be storing any video settings at all in Steam Cloud saves. It makes it a real nuisance switching between systems like PC, Steam Deck and other handhelds. So it's good to see the issue solved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uI5t2oXQSAg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6af285e589383d445996dcd86bffe949.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uI5t2oXQSAg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the game:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Spilled! is a gorgeous and relaxing short game about cleaning up the ocean</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spilled! is a thoroughly relaxing cute gem about driving a little boat and cleaning up the ocean, to bring life back to the planet. Playable on Linux and Steam Deck, it worked perfectly with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. Note: the developer sent me a key.</p>
<p>With you starting off in a tiny and slow little boat as you clean up more of the ocean you'll earn some coins to upgrade your engine, storage and your front bumper scoop to deal with all that plastic floating around. This is the kind of game where you can just happily zone-out from the world. It's so incredibly satisfying seeing each section come alive as you clean it up, a reminder that we have a beautiful world that we love to ruin.</p>
<p>A game designed for you to take your time and just take it all in. No pressure here at all, no timers, nothing you can do wrong. Just drive the boat and clean things up.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xYfb_orPMoM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aef5de89e1ff2cdb7183213f0148d47b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xYfb_orPMoM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is a rather short game at only an hour or so, but worth it for people who like sweet casual games with a good message to them. The developer is also giving a cut of the funding to Whale and Dolphin Conservation from every Steam purchase.</p>
<p>I just wish it was longer. It's a lovely game and worth taking a look at, it's just so peaceful. If the developer ever decides to expand it with a full bigger sequel or a big expansion DLC, I'll be first in line.</p>

      <title>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms gets a major update with new missions, AI improvements and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms is a huge free RTS game based on OpenRA that includes Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert action combined in one game with plenty of extras and enhancements.</p>
<p>It's easily one of my favourite OpenRA games, as a big fan of the classics growing up playing both Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert. And thanks to EA making them free so long ago, you don't need anything extra to play Combined Arms — it's fully standalone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3020683261743675845gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3020683261743675845gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5510907781743675847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5510907781743675847gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Combined Arms 1.06</em></p>

We've also implemented a smart transport unit system, making troop deployment faster and more efficient on the battlefield. These enhancements open up new tactical possibilities and customization options, taking your gameplay experience to the next level."</p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay, now I'm excited. Sonic Rumble from SEGA is the first major multiplayer party game for the series and Valve have rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Given that it's an online multiplayer game (up to 32 players), I was worried that anti-cheat would be problematic like it is for so many other games on Linux platforms. Thankfully, it seems this is not the case so players on Linux platforms like Steam Deck will be able to play. Valve tested it with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>It does use Kernel Level Anti-Cheat called Uncheater noted on the Steam page, which seems to be some variant of XIGNCODE3. Sonic Rumble has been added to our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ckFLOcCsO_I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8eecebaa6b0b749d7d0975838af30f17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ckFLOcCsO_I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We don't yet know when the game will release though. SEGA said last month it will be sometime "this Spring" so that could be any date up until June 21st.</p>

      <title>SteamVR Beta 2.10.2 released with a Linux VR fix and a controller and physics improvement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released SteamVR Beta 2.10.2 on April 2nd, and thankfully it includes a couple of fixes for Linux VR players.</p>
<p>Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved automatic throttling behavior. Reduces controller and physics jitter from throttling and prediction changes in response to performance variations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>OpenXR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Better handling of non-pipelined applications. Reduces controller jitter for Unity OpenXR apps.</li>
<li>Remove XR_FB_foveation from the list of available extensions.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed empty black window when starting SteamVR on Linux.</li>
<li>Added window icons to SteamVR windows on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Valve remember that Linux exists for VR. We don't see SteamVR seeing many improvements for Linux very often. I'm still hoping whatever the new VR set from Valve turns out to be results in more VR improvements for Linux, if all the rumours and leaks of it using Linux are true.</p>

      <title>DELTARUNE chapters 1-4 release on Steam in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>UNDERTALE fans are pretty excited about this one! DELTARUNE from tobyfox is finally coming to Steam with chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 on June 5th. The first 2 chapters have been available free for a while now and we're finally getting 2 more chapters with the Steam release.</p>
<p>There's also a new trailer with the announcement of it coming to the Nintendo Switch 2:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yDzgiGdekas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/68a5be8e3468372eff6d263543189856.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yDzgiGdekas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There will be one difference between the Switch 2 and PC release, as the developer explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an effort to make the most of being a LAUNCH TITLE for the Nintendo Switch 2, I really wanted to try to do something special...</p>
<p>So, we made a very small SPECIAL ROOM which takes advantage of using MOUSE CONTROLS ON TWO CONTROLLERS AT ONCE, only possible on the Nintendo Switch 2!! You can see it in the trailer!!</p>
<p>But, don't worry! Even if you can't get your hands on a Nintendo Switch 2 right away, the other versions of the game also have THE SPECIAL ROOM, with a completely different control scheme! (To clarify, all non-Nintendo Switch 2 versions have the exact same content as each other.)</p>
<p>There is no meaningful difference in content amount, dialogue, setting, music etc between any version, so you will have a full package of fun no matter which you get! No one gets left out!</p>
<p>And -- just to clarify for the cats in the back -- no matter what version you buy, EVERYONE gets PLUEY -- for FREE!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who haven't played UNDERTALE, fear not, you don't need to have.</p>
<p>At release it will cost $24.99. You only have to buy it once, with additional chapters planned as free updates as confirmed in the recent <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-date/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter</a>. Chapter 4 is firmly not the end for DELTARUNE, as there's still chapter 5 to come later . There will also be a soundtrack for $14.99 that will have over 150 tracks.</p>
<p>You can also follow the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tobyfox.undertale.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Bullet hell dungeon crawler Enter the Gungeon 2 announced with a new 3D style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dodge Roll and Devolver Digital announced Enter the Gungeon 2 today, teased during the Nintendo Switch 2 event and it's coming to Steam as well in 2026.</p>
<p>The first game is truly a blast to play through, so I'm definitely keen to see more on it. This new 3D style looks like it will make it seriously intense too, at least from the short teaser that was shown off.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gg15MFGINWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e63f5f18aaf312f715100ca59d06c6c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gg15MFGINWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter the Gungeon 2 is a reloaded, high-caliber sequel to the iconic bullet hell dungeon crawler, reinforced with a new 3D art style, new weapons and enemies, and expanded gameplay.</p>
<p>Battle through areas familiar and unknown as the ruined Gungeon reveals its secrets to those brave enough to enter. Discover, unlock, and master fantastic weaponry within its procedurally generated halls and destroy the legions of Gundead pouring forth from within. Charge into dynamic battles against devilishly cute enemies, previously confined to the 2D plane, and delight as they are knocked around, tossed into the air, and thrown deep into pits.</p>
<p>Choose from an expanding roster of Gungeoneers full of both familiar and new faces as you rescue and extract marooned heroes from the depths of the Gungeon. Become mighty through unexpected combinations of powerful passive items, explosive active items, blessings, curses, and your own mastery over an impressive armory of weapons.</p>
<p>And seek to understand why you find yourself under assault in the Gungeon once again...</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong lives and it&#39;s releasing in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is not a drill. Hollow Knight: Silksong is alive, thankfully, and it's even going to be releasing this year. On Nintendo Switch 2 that is at least.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting some big reveal here though, because this isn't it. During the Nintendo Switch 2 event today we were graced with just a few seconds of footage, which also clearly showed a 2025 release date. We're still waiting to see about an official announcement from Team Cherry directly on a release date for any other platform. At least for Hollow Knight fans though, the wait will soon be over in some form.</p>

<em>Pictured - Hollow Knight: Silksong. Credit: Nintendo / Team Cherry</em></p>
<p>I'll be keeping a close eye out for any more news on it. Given the tiny slice we saw today though, it's likely Team Cherry aren't yet ready to divulge any more.</p>

      <title>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck stable update released with various fixes, plus tweaks to the download UI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released and then rereleased a fresh stable update to the Steam Client for Desktop and Steam Deck with a whole bunch of fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>The initial launch came with some problems on both Desktop and Steam Deck. The rereleased update fixes a "display issue on game details page for games with queued updates" across both. But for Steam Deck, there were bigger problems with these two issues quickly getting solved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed TDP and GPU clock performance settings not working.</li>
<li>Fixed crash loop at startup when Wifi Debug Mode setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the rest of the stable update this was specific for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>'Enable Steam Play for all other titles' is always enabled on SteamOS, updated the UI accordingly to stop showing a non functional toggle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And all these apply across all supported systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed brief layout shift of elements (one or two frames) when navigating back to the library section.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Client window focusing multiple times on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed Update News window being covered by Steam Client window at startup.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications displaying in wrong position in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed some instances where windows fail to render after display events.</li>
<li>Fixed game content switching from private beta to default branch in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed child accounts in a family getting additional playtime after switching to offline mode.</li>
<li>Fixed in-game friends sometimes not showing up in the "Friends Who Play" section of the game details page.</li>
<li>Improved accuracy of download progress and time estimates. Accuracy will improve over the course of more downloads.</li>
<li>Improved consistency and clarity of download/install/update UI:
	<ul>
<li>Byte counts, when displayed, refer to the number of bytes to download.</li>
<li>Progress bars and percentages, when displayed, refer to the total progress of the install/update, which includes work before, after, and during the download. The exception is the top (blue) progress bar on the downloads page, which shows the bytes downloaded.</li>
<li>Time remaining estimates refer to the total progress of the install/update. These estimates will be very rough at first but will become more accurate as Steam learns more about the performance of the user's network and disks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that could allow the keyboard to cover the target text area when summoned from a game.</li>
</ul>
<strong>macOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Overlay support for games using HDR rendering.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved the download speed of Steam client updates.</li>
<li>No longer applying compatibility tool filtering to shortcuts.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where non-steam Protons could get assigned an incorrect compatibility tool.</li>
<li>Fixed initial positioning of dropdown menus.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controller input when streaming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</li>
<li>Fixed sending a Remote Play Together invite from a VR game streaming to a headset</li>
</ul>
