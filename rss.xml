<p>It will show up in your Steam Downloads as an update for Proton 10 Beta if you had it installed. Otherwise, it will automatically download if you go to play a game that Valve has set for Proton 10 by default. Or, you can manually search for Proton 10 in your Steam Library to install it and try it on some games.</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat will still be one of the biggest problems for the new Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kernel-level anti-cheat feels like it's everywhere now, and will remain a thorn in Valve's side for the new Steam Machine powered by SteamOS Linux.</p>
<p>On Linux, there's no kernel-level mode available for anti-cheats like they would use on Windows. I know plenty of readers, and gamers across the net probably see it as a benefit due to privacy concerns, and that's fine - but it doesn't change what a lot of people want to play that can't.</p>
<p>This is something many bigger games simply don't want to pull away from including the likes of Call of Duty, Vanguard from Riot, EA Javelin for Battlefield and so on. While we do have some anti-cheat vendors that support Linux like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye (and a few others), it's user-mode with no kernel-level and many developers really don't like that.</p>
<p>Valve's Steam Deck helped a fair bit, with a number of titles that do have something enabled for Linux systems at least, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like with the popular ARC Raiders</a>. What about the Steam Machine though? And even the Steam Frame since it also uses SteamOS, and can play standalone games?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> spoke to Valve on this, with Valve believing it will help things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While [the] Steam Machine also requires Dev participation to enable anti-cheat, we think the incentives for enabling Anti- cheat on Machine to be higher than on Deck as we expect more people to play multiplayer games on it. So ultimately we hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is, the Steam Machine needs to actually sell, and probably a <em>lot</em> more than the Steam Deck has managed so far to actually put a dent in things for the bigger publishers to even begin to take notice and certainly above <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/linux-gamers-on-steam-finally-cross-over-the-3-mark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 3% Linux overall is at currently on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Not just the AAA lot, but games like Rust too. Alistair McFarlane from Facepunch Studios recently replied on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/1ouvpv1/comment/nojbzts/?context=3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to a request to have it enabled, and replied to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="py-0 xs:mx-xs mx-2xs max-w-full scalable-text" id="t1_nofbyxo-post-rtjson-content" style="--emote-size: 20px">
<p>"There are no plans to support Proton or Linux. It’s a vector for cheat developers, and one that would be poorly maintained by both us and EAC due to the low user base. When we stopped support for Linux, we saw more cheat users exploiting Linux, than actual legitimate users.</p>
<p>When monitoring cheats for Rust, we keep a close eye on wider cheat communities across several major games. We look at what cheat developers are doing, and how other studios are responding.</p>
<p>From that experience, I’m very comfortable saying that if a game supports Proton or Linux, they’re not serious about anti-cheat. The only exception would be if they have a fully mature, dedicated in-house anti-cheat team, even then, I'm not seeing anyone handle Proton and Linux well.</p>
<p>Apex Legends also dropped Proton support in October 2024 for the same reasons as we did several years ago.</p>
<p>Could we limit Proton to Premium servers? yes, but I think it's total bullshit asking Proton users to buy the game and then $15 worth of DLC. I'd be pissed if I were forced to do that.</p>
<p>When we stopped supporting Linux, users made up less than .01% of the total player base, even if that number has doubled, or tripled, it's not worth it.</p>
<p>I know that every time I post something like this, some Proton and Linux users call us lazy or dismissive. The reality is that fighting cheaters on one front (Windows), is already a never-ending battle. Adding more fronts multiplies that challenge without adding meaningful benefit to the wider player base."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/blocking-linux-steam-deck-in-apex-legends-led-to-a-meaningful-reduction-in-cheaters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A similar story for Apex Legends</a> where their team noted they saw a "meaningful reduction in the amount of cheating recently" once they blocked Linux. In that article we also referenced the same McFarlane from Facepunch, who made a similar comment years ago. Nothing there has changed it seems.</p>
<p>So even if the Steam Machine sells a bunch, this is a technical problem that needs solving. Who will be the ones to do it? Valve or game publishers / developers? It's going to be complicated.</p>
<p>We're currently tracking it on our own curated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.

You can also follow <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat article tag</a>. We'll be sure to keep you up to date on the Linux / SteamOS anti-cheat situation as it develops.</p>

      <title>Hot on the heels of the Steam Frame announcement, SteamVR Beta 2.14.1 brings more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve only just released the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamvr-2-13-brings-a-whole-lot-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stable SteamVR update in version 2.13</a>, but SteamVR 2.14.1 Beta is now here as well with more tweaks and fixes.</p>
<p>I expect with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement of the new Steam Frame</a> (and Steam Machine / Steam Controller), we're going to see a bunch more rapid updates to get SteamVR truly ready for it. Although, the Steam Deck did come in pretty hot, so it will be interesting to see if the Steam Frame launches with many issues. <em>We have till early 2026 to find out…</em></p>
<p>Anyway, here's what's new in SteamVR 2.14.1 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve startup speed when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could cause "Port 27062 in use" (can also manifest as error 309) when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could result in error 302 or error 101, especially in unusual startup configurations.</li>
<li>Changed Binding UI to allow saving bindings that don't bind all required actions (with confirmation).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HMD simulation would persist after an app using controller simulation ended.</li>
<li>Fixed some scenarios where the wrong render model would be displayed when multiple devices were simulating.</li>
<li>Fix a crash that could occur if the roomview processing was delayed.</li>
<li>Updated dashboard binding for HP Motion Controller to fix screenshots, smooth scrolling, and take advantage of Quick Recenter.</li>
<li>The prompt to setup SteamVR for app containers and web applications now covers cases where SteamVR is installed outside of its normal location.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Link:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix Steam Link freeze for users with AMD video cards ("Error 250").</li>
<li>Minor judder improvements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix a shared memory leak that happened each time an app disconnected from SteamVR.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the Steam Frame will use Linux (SteamOS), I'm really hoping we see Valve eventually get SteamVR into good shape for Linux as a whole. Would be a bit weird if it wasn't improved, considering the Steam Machine runs Linux (SteamOS) too. However, since the Steam Frame is either standalone or you stream to it, this will work in a very different way to say the Valve Index which according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817967/valve-index-vr-headset-stopped-manufacturing-frame" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> is no longer in production.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders is expanding with a new map but first a multi-phase event to unlock it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the first major update for ARC Raiders now available, we have an in-game event for players to work towards unlocking the next map.</p>
<p>Eventually, we'll be able to travel around the new Stella Montis map. First though, we all have to donate a bunch of goodies into the work including Metal Parts, Fabric, Chemicals, Rubber Parts and Plastic Parts. You know, all the junk we keep building up! When you donate, you build up a new Merits credit to eventually spend on rewards on the next stage of the event.</p>
<p>It initially started off pretty darn fast, with developers Embark having to raise the requirements quite a lot otherwise it would have been over far too soon. As they posted in Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been progressing the unlock event much faster than we anticipated. We had no idea all of you would be so altruistic for the Stella Montis cause, and you are donating so much more than we could imagine. We want this event to be experienced by Raiders all over the world and therefore we are raising the bar to unlock Stella Montis expecting you to surprise us again.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O9JeiBAAey4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bad9edbee8ce67435392d8e8327df9d8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O9JeiBAAey4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This new map sounds quite different too, potentially more cramped than all of the current rather open maps as you explore a big facility. Can't wait to see what it really is when it's finally open.</p>
<p>Patch highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduced character movement latency on server to improve the "desync" problem where it looks like you get damaged even after behind cover.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented players from completing quests involving multiple objectives or item collections within a single round.</li>
<li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly. Players will need to redo some achievements with only one objective item (e.g. “Destroy the Queen”) while achievements with multiple objectives will only need parts of them completed again.</li>
<li>Reduced delay between shooting at ARC and seeing impact effects on the target.</li>
<li>Fixed various locations where players could fall through the terrain.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See much more in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/north-line-patch-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>One issue that has come up is their nerf of the Security Locker drop rate. Considering it's a skill you have to unlock, some are not happy about it. In Discord they confirmed they're looking into the "possibility of adding a skill reset mechanic".</p>
<p>Thankfully, even with the major 1.2 update out, there's no problems with it running on Linux still. Perhaps we won't see what we do with THE FINALS, where it ends up breaking for a few days on every update.

<p>The Khronos Group, the stewards of various open protocols like OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenXR and more just revealed a new tool for XR (VR / AR) developers.</p>
<p>What is OpenXR exactly? As The Khronos Group explain: "OpenXR is a royalty-free, open standard that provides a common set of APIs for developing XR applications that run across a wide range of AR and VR devices. This reduces the time and cost required for developers to adapt solutions to individual XR platforms while also creating a larger market of easily supported applications for device manufacturers that adopt OpenXR".</p>
<p>So it's the open standard for VR games to be built with, to sum it up easily for you. It's what Valve actually focus on nowadays for SteamVR.</p>
<p>What's been announced? Today, The Khronos Group released the "Best Practices Validation Layer", a tool in their SDK for OpenXR developers to ensure their apps and games will actually work as expected. As they said it "addresses a critical need in XR development: catching suboptimal API usage patterns that can lead to inconsistent behavior across different OpenXR runtimes".</p>
<p>Just because there's an open API, it doesn't mean developers will know exactly how to use it properly or to ensure compatibility across devices, and this should help solve that. As they went onto explain: "While the OpenXR specification defines the features that implementations must support, it doesn't always prescribe the optimal way to utilize these features. Certain usage patterns, though technically valid, can cause applications to behave differently across various XR runtimes or lead to performance issues that are difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The Best Practices Validation Layer bridges this gap by providing real-time warnings when developers use API patterns that may cause problems, even if those patterns don't violate the OpenXR specification."</p>
<p>Should be good news for any developers planning to support the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly announced Steam Frame from Valve</a> for example.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is getting mid-run saves and an endless mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is set for some major improvements, although we don't know exactly when but it will make surviving in it a whole lot nicer.</p>
<p>Eventually, they've confirmed recently, they will be adding in mid-run saves. So whenever you visit a shop, you'll be able to save and quit. Having to go through an entire run is a bit of a nuisance, so it's great to see that being solved. Still, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-is-an-excellent-horde-survival-game-1-0-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I very much loved the game</a> from the 1.0 release. On top of that, an endless mode is also in the works too. Posted in an official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/590661866525556839" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve got something exciting in the works for you! In this Development Log, we want to tell you about a much-requested feature the team is working on: Mid-run saving.</p>
<p>So how does it work? When you quit the game, your progress will now start at the last shop you visited. That means no more losing a great run because your pet lootbug tripped over the power cable.</p>
<p>This feature is also related to the much-anticipated Endless Mode (yes, still coming). Runs in this mode can take a lot longer, and your decisions will carry even more weight, so being able to safely pause or recover after a crash on a late stage will make the experience smoother and far less frustrating.</p>
<p>It’s a feature that’s pretty seamless but has a big impact, and we can’t wait for you to try it out and tell us what you think. We’ll make sure to keep you posted on when you can expect this feature to drop in the future.</p>

      <title>The excellent CloverPit has sold over 1 million and gets a Hard Mode update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CloverPit is a rather excellent game that's hit the jackpot for the developer, as they're cashing in on over 1 million sales and celebrating with a big update. No need to stick more coins in the slot, take your hand off that slot machine arm as it's a free update. I really <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/pull-the-lever-to-gamble-and-break-the-machine-in-cloverpit-a-slot-machine-with-horror-vibes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite enjoyed my time</a> with this one.</p>
<p>With the hard mode update v1.2 out now it adds a new way to play, where the deadline amount is doubled, which could actually make some of it truly a lot more challenging. There's also lots of tweaks to charms and other assorted improvements throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's a mini-trailer for the update below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vel6NCHRrFU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/159ada30b778f67751384d2b0a5bb575.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vel6NCHRrFU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And the launch trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6f_6xETRrOI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb4332f73ec857571b74fa54c2c37de1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6f_6xETRrOI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The update version 1.2 adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Hard mode to memory cards: if you win with a memory card once you will now unlock the possibility to play it with double the deadline ammount.</li>
<li>Winning during hard mode will now make the memory card rainbow, instead of having to win with that memory card 3 times.</li>
<li>Calendar buffed: now it increases the symbols multiplier instead of increasing the symbols themselves.</li>
<li>Calendar is now Rare instead of Uncommon</li>
<li>Ring bell now increases the symbols multiplier instead of the symbols themselves.</li>
<li>Ring bell now costs 2 tickets instead of 3</li>
<li>Hourglass’effect has been changed as it was the most useless thing ever seen in the entire universe. Now it alternates between growing the symbols and pattern multipliers at the end of each deadline, but it takes 1 extra space. It’s really strong and do not argue against me, OK??!?!?! You will need to use ur big brain between using this or the megaphone or the nuke button. They keep me prisoner in a cell under the Pacific Ocean! Please call for help!</li>
<li>Hourglass now costs a bit more and it’s rare. Nothing special to read here. Please continue reading :)</li>
<li>Cigarettes now have an 80% chance of restocking the store with them in it. Sorry guys, it was necessary to prevent endless runs</li>
<li>CloverPot has been nerfed. Sorry guys, it was necessary to prevent endless runs</li>
<li>Nerfed Naughty Dealer</li>
<li>Nerfed Bricks, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Stone, Harbor &amp; Thief</li>
<li>Charm trait about symbols multiplier now grants +2 instead of 1</li>
<li>Tickets charm trait now grants +3 tickets instead of 2</li>
<li>Buffed fruit basket to 10 rounds duration instead of 7</li>
<li>Deadlines will grow more exponentially after 15 deadlines</li>
</ul>
<strong>VARIOUS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added game completition % near the toilet</li>
<li>Added counter of how many memory cards the player has fully foiled into rainbow holographic</li>
<li>Added counter of how many memory cards the player has cleared</li>
<li>Made dialogue red after the bad ending, so people will pay attention to it and assume they are not done yet with the game.</li>
<li>Added check for mods. If a game is modded, a gear will show up in the bottom left!</li>
<li>When you click on the door key in the box, once the skeleton is completed, if it’s not the deadline time a dialogue will show up prompting you to keep playing</li>
</ul>
<strong>FIXES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Disabled Twitch integration on Linux platforms for those who experienced crashes when there was no internet connection</li>
<li>Added manual garbage collection in some situations trying to mitigate memory leaks when using linux with proton</li>
<li>Weird Clock now resets its deadline limit even if it’s inside a drawer.</li>
<li>Weird Clock now doesn’t reset the deadline limit when discarded. Only the end of deadline can reset the limit</li>
<li>Weird Clock won’t show up in the store as long as it has reached the usage limit</li>
<li>Fixed bug where some 3d models in drawers would overlap with charms (like the vynil player)</li>
<li>Paredolia effect is now permanent as per description</li>
<li>Added a safeguard to prevent infinity value on patterns value, to avoid crashes. The patterns will be clamped to max value: 1.7976931348623157E+308</li>
<li>Fixed cloverfield tickets bonus. It only granted half of it</li>
<li>Fixed items appearing small in stats screen after death/victory</li>
<li>Fixed localization issues as per player feedback</li>
<li>Rotten pepper now works as it should: doesn’t reset if you continue the previous run after closing the game.</li>
</ul>

      <title>You can grab a free copy of Immortals Fenyx Rising from Ubisoft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a free game ready for the weekend? How about Immortals Fenyx Rising from Ubisoft? Well you can claim it free to keeps right now.</p>
<p>The major caveat here is that it's done through Ubisoft directly, not Steam. So for Linux / SteamOS gamers, you'll need to install Ubisoft Connect using Wine or Proton.

      <title>Of course dbrand is doing a Steam Machine Companion Cube</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> brand new Steam Machine from Valve</a> right? But what about a Steam Machine Companion Cube? Yes that's also now going to be a thing. And…I think I want it? Possibly.</p>
<p>Coming from dbrand, who you might know from various skins and a few accessories for other devices (including the Steam Deck). We can expect it sometime next year when the new <s>Gabecube</s> Steam Machine releases, but there's no real details on it on their website at all.</p>
<p>It's "Limited Edition", so you may have to act fast on it. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819863/dbrand-companion-cube-valve-steam-machine-skin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> it's not a normal skin, but a case that attaches to it. With the design still being finalised. Other skins will also be coming, which is not surprising, I'm sure other companies will also be looking to make some accessories too.</p>

      <title>Valve reveal the new Steam Frame, Steam Controller and Steam Machine with SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day has arrived, Valve have announced a major hardware expansion with multiple devices including the new Steam Frame, Steam Controller and Steam Machine. And of course, they're powered by SteamOS (Linux), exactly the sort of thing we cover! Massive news for Linux gaming, and shows how committed Valve are to open source and having an open platform.</p>
<p>"We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck," said Gabe Newell, President of Valve, "and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries. Our work over the years on other hardware and even more importantly on SteamOS has enabled Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame to do just that."</p>

<p>Valve do note in the press details how some of the specs are subject to change, so these may not be exactly final.</p>
<p>As part of this, Valve will be expanding the Steam Deck Verified program. This will include new ratings for the Steam Frame and Steam Machine. They will be known as Steam Machine Verified and Steam Frame Verified.</p>
<p>This is what we have been waiting for and why GamingOnLinux exists. We've been covering Linux gaming for years before Valve even came along, and Valve have practically kept us in business with all their open source work (and especially Proton).</p>
<p>Unlike the original launch of the first attempt at the Steam Machine, Valve has come a seriously long way to make it viable. Proton, the tool to run Windows games on Linux, has made it click and play for tens of thousands of games. So now, it makes a lot more sense.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OmKrKTwtukE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4490dea4e1634a49f82eb4bd083b17bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Absolutely amazing. Much like when Valve originally announced Proton, I feel a bit of the shakes over here from excitement. This is truly some world-changing stuff going on for Linux gaming. It's time for the stranglehold that Microsoft have had with Windows to end.</p>
<p>What this also should hopefully do, is put a bit more pressure on developers to get their anti-cheat enabled for Linux, otherwise that's still going to be quite a number of popular games that won't be playable on any of these devices. As we're tracking on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. Especially so if the Steam Machine is priced reasonably, that could be a ridiculous amount of extra players using SteamOS Linux. Developers are going to <em>need</em> to pay a lot more attention to how their games run on Linux.</p>
<p>On top of that, it will be interesting to see if Epic Games will rethink their stance on the Epic Store and Fortnite.</p>
<p>We've opened up some new content tags for you to follow along: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/steam-frame/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame</a> | <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Machine</a>. You can also <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">join us on Discord</a> with dedicated chat channels.</p>
<p>Sadly, Valve did not provide GamingOnLinux with any heads up on it, so we're playing catch-up on all the details. There's also currently no word on review samples like we had for the Steam Deck LCD and Steam Deck OLED, so if you want to ensure we can grab them <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">please do support GamingOnLinux directly</a>.</p>

      <title>The wonderful roguelite farming deckbuilder Cropdeck has a proper demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Plant, grow and harvest in the farming roguelite deckbuilder Cropdeck, with a demo out now that you definitely need to put on your list to try.</p>
<p>It's all about clearing fields while planting crops strategically, as you build up a deck of plants, and use items like scarecrows to make some fun synergies to pay off your tax. I played a previous early version of it, and came away pretty impressed by it. A wholesome spin on deck building, while a bit more laid back than others it's still challenging and interesting to play through.</p>
<p>See the previous trailer below:</p>

      <title>Satisfactory gets optimizations, and improved Steam Deck support in patch 1.1.1.7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coffee Stain Studios are showing how it's done, with Satisfactory getting a bunch of optimizations, and there's also improved Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Across all systems you should see improvements to RAM usage in big saves, which sounds nice. As for the Steam Deck, a bunch of improvements for the UI and graphics presets that should give a better overall experience. They're hoping this will get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified (currently sits at Playable).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7463617661762961801gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The latest patch 1.1.1.7 rolled out November 11th and notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OPTIMIZATION</strong></p>

<li>Refactored Spline Collision
	<ul>
<li>This affects Conveyor Belts, Pipelines and Hypertubes and should lead to RAM usage improvements in big saves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>STEAM DECK</strong>
<ul>
<li>First time experience improvements
	<ul>
<li>Improved font size and UI scaling defaults across the board</li>
<li>Added new values for the default graphical presets for Steam Deck only (Quality and Performance modes are available similar to console, with values you can tweak manually if preferred as well)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed confirm button to X on the Server Manager menu to avoid soft locks when inputting text using the Virtual Keyboard on Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUG FIXES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed visual flickering in the sky around Northern Forest during nighttime</li>
<li>Fixed issues when saving a game with a custom name on Steam Deck</li>

      <title>KOMODO&#39;s Steam Deck store is renaming to KOMODO STATION - perhaps ahead of the Steam Frame</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something is definitely happening in Valve land, as the KOMODO Steam Deck Store is being renamed KOMODO STATION tomorrow, November 13th.</p>
<p>For those not clued up — KOMODO are the official distributor of the Steam Deck for Asian markets including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. We've seen many leaks over the years about Valve preparing a new VR kit, along with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/new-valve-trademark-for-steam-frame-looks-like-were-getting-new-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam Frame trademark</a>.</p>
<p>All signs are pointing to an official Valve announcement to come really soon.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/announcement-komodo-steam-deck-store-will-be-renewed-as-komodo-station-starting-november-13-2025/?lang=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Thank you very much for using our store.<br/>
We are pleased to announce that the “KOMODO Steam Deck Store” will be renewed as “KOMODO STATION” on November 13, 2025.<br/>
Along with this renewal, the store’s URL will change as follows:</p>
<p>Old Store:<br/>
KOMODO Steam Deck Store<br/>
URL: https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/</p>
<p>New Store:<br/>
KOMODO STATION<br/>
URL: https://komodostation.com/</p>
<p>Please note that customers who have registered or used the old store can continue to use their account information in the new store.<br/>
We sincerely appreciate your continued support.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, what else could it be? Apart from the Steam Controller 2 as well perhaps. Or, KOMODO perhaps getting into supply hardware from other vendors, that's also entirely possible.</p>
<p>If it is the Steam Frame, I expect it to be a new VR kit powered by SteamOS with Proton supported on Arm to run games from other VR sets. Another possibly huge step for Linux gaming overall. There's a lot of excitement building up here.</p>

      <title>Embark confirm &#34;Duo prioritized matchmaking&#34; for ARC Raiders and lowered store prices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Studios have confirmed some recent changes to ARC Raiders, including a highly requested change for Duos to have a bit more fun with it. The game has been running very well on Linux, even with the Easy Anti-Cheat as it's enabled. It's listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with the game previously is that Solo players were matched with other Solos and Trios with other Trios, but if you only had two players for a Duo, you were thrown into Trios games - which made it more difficult than it should be. There is an option to party up with randoms, but that's not always wanted. However, that changed beginning this week as confirmed today in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> where Embark said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have silently tested and <strong>enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking</strong>, beginning earlier this week. Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100% guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it may not be perfect, but definitely a <em>lot</em> better.</p>
<p>On top of that, they've also listened to complaints about the in-game shop prices being ridiculous, something I noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my more detailed article on it recently</a>. Adjustments to the pricing to be lower will go live tomorrow, Thursday the 13th at 10:30 CET / 09:30 UTC. They will also be refunding the difference to players who already purchased at the old prices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6738979721762954472gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6738979721762954472gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - ARC Raiders on Linux</em></p>
<p>Another thing they also confirmed is that the Raider Decks are basically their Battle Pass system. The current one is entirely free, with you earning points to pick stuff from it during the game. They've said they'll be adding more free Decks to it, along with Paid decks too. They made it clear that there will be "no Pay to Win items in the premium Raider Decks" with a focus on "cosmetics and convenience".</p>
<p>Still, I'm a bit concerned what these <em>convenience</em> items will be in the upcoming Premium Raider Decks. They might not intentionally be pay to win, but they could result in an advantage. Then again, items can be just as easily lost to another player during a match. Will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Overall it's great to see that they're properly listening to players.</p>
<p>If you want to pick it up, it seems Fanatical still somehow have it on a 14% discount.</p>

      <title>Beatblock may look simple but this rhythm-action game is absolutely brilliant (and brutal)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beatblock has such a simple style to it that it may fool you into thinking it's a rather basic game, but the rhythm-action is provides is properly good.<em> Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>Entering Early Access in September, it fell down a bit of a hole in the GamingOnLinux inbox that I'm putting right today, because I'm not usually one for such rhythm games but it won my over during the tutorial. That's how fast it hooked me because of the clever game mechanics, and the wonderfully popping tunes to go with it. It's also really flipping challenging too. In a few ways, it reminded me a bit of the classic Super Hexagon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17345015731762953339gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Every song literally revolves around you, and so you have to keep up with it. You're in the middle, controlling a little face with a paddle that you rotate around you to catch blocks in time with the clicks from the tunes.</p>
<p>You get basic square blocks to hit, then there's longer curved blocks you need to move the paddle with to keep up, circles that form around you and shrink down until they hit the paddle where you need to mouse-click at the right time and then also blocks that come towards you with circles around them that require a mouse click too. Especially difficult at times when it combines them together, like the longer blocks that additionally require a mouse click at the start, and to take your finger off the button right at the end.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that, as once you get into more tunes you'll see even more game mechanics making it even more varied and challenging.</p>
<p>Just so many little bits together that make sure you give it 110% of your attention. It's one of those deceptively simple looking games, that's anything but simple.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CuCUjDOTtQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d48f29306f52576a52400079ffe58995.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CuCUjDOTtQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore new mechanics across 25+ songs in the Atom Map, from learning the basics to tackling challenges!
	<ul>
<li>More songs are planned for future updates to bring the final scope to 40+ songs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flow with the music in different ways with multiple block types.</li>
<li>Tailor-made visuals for every song to set the scene (or mess with you...)</li>
<li>Customize Cranky however you want with unlockable costumes!</li>
<li>Chart a new path on your own songs with the built-in level editor!</li>
<li>Accessibility options to tweak the game and have fun on your own terms!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic, if you can handle the challenge. The "Easy" mode is just a lie, there's nothing easy about it.</p>

      <title>Tabulo is an upcoming Balatro-inspired chess roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Balatro-inspired game and this time it's a chess roguelike, and one that actually looks like it could be pretty fun. There's a demo available which has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Positioning is key here, since it's taking a bunch of elements of chess. Keep enhancing your pieces, purchase new powers and grab some bonuses from different challenges. But with the board being quite compact, it can be a challenge and you have to be careful. Each run has you build up a unique board and fill it with different pieces with their own synergies, but it's still all about increasing that score. As you progress you'll unlock new pieces, tiles and boards.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Several chess pieces to add to your board.</li>
<li>100  tiles, each with its unique ability.</li>
<li>10 boards with different modifiers to choose from every run.</li>
<li>25 coins that can modify your pieces, board and impact every run.</li>
<li>8 difficulty levels that provide unique and increasingly harder challenges.</li>
<li>20 bosses that make every run a new challenge.</li>

      <title>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage silently added Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With no official notice from the developer, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage recently added in Easy Anti-Cheat. It's not listed on the Steam page either, which appears to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">against Valve's rules on this</a>. Valve really need to clamp down on their rules to ensure developers are correctly listing things.</p>
<p>Originally just called Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., the Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage rename and update came out at the end of October. There's been a bunch of complaints about it, including the silent addition of kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>I've tried personally testing it on Linux with the update with Proton 9 to confirm, and I can see clearly it loads in Easy Anti-Cheat and the game itself appears to work. You can get into searching for opponents but I have been unable to verify if the online does actually connect now to another player since it never finds a match. So for now, it's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a> under a new status of waiting on reports from players.</p>
<p>A shame when developers choose to do such things silently, it's a slap in the face to fans of the game to be so secretive about a technical change like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f8mibe385yE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7f1b18f745e87e94aa60c82d01784aea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f8mibe385yE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve from January and Platinum on ProtonDB, but all current reports on it are older.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN The Forsaken Hollows arrives December 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN, the standalone multiplayer co-op survival action game by FromSoftware, Inc. is set to expand on December 4 with The Forsaken Hollows.</p>
<p>The base game does have Easy Anti-Cheat, which much like the first game is enabled for Linux / SteamOS, and so you'll have no problems jumping into it with the DLC. It's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. It also has the GuardIT DRM.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DLC introduces two new third day bosses, new field bosses, a new Shifting Earth -- a special condition where the map sees massive geographical changes, and new points of interest in Limveld for players to explore. Two new Nightfarers are joining the fray as well, with new abilities to take on the Night’s Tide. Players who own or purchase the Deluxe or Collector’s editions of ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN will automatically receive the DLC at launch; other players are able to purchase the DLC separately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>SteamVR 2.13 brings a whole lot of bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While many of us are no doubt waiting on whatever the Steam Frame turns out to be, Valve have released the latest stable SteamVR release with lots of bug fixes. <em>There's even a couple in there for Linux too.</em></p>
<p>Valve say they are continuing to focus on OpenXR as their preferred API for new games and apps, and so a lot of their work keeps focusing on that. Which would also make sense if the Steam Frame arrives as a VR kit, sticking to an open standard would be good.</p>
<p>Here's everything that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a crash that could occur when the AMD GPU driver was installed but no AMD GPU was present.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility mode bindings showing as custom bindings when they are remapped default bindings.</li>
<li>Automatically prefer installing the <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824490/Oasis_Driver_for_Windows_Mixed_Reality/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Oasis Driver for Windows Mixed Reality</a> when running on a Windows version too new to support the Windows driver.</li>
<li>Roomview is independently enabled for VR vs non-VR gameplay.</li>
<li>Minor UX improvements to improve consistency with Steam (window reflectivity, colors, etc).</li>
<li>Added setting (general -&gt; advanced) to disable IPD HUD.</li>
<li>Reduced memory usage for user interface textures (improved performance).</li>
<li>Fix for the Default / Custom binding toggle in the Settings UI not working properly in some cases.</li>
<li>Fix for Recenter and Room View buttons not showing up in some cases.</li>
<li>Fix desktop settings showing a completely black screen (under error reporting conditions).</li>
<li>By default, Controller Compatibility Mode will now show users their physical controller render models (but still return simulated names to games).</li>
<li>Added new options to Controller Compatibility Mode render model simulation.</li>
<li>Fixed a few cases where controller input would be broken if a game or steam had been moved.</li>
<li>Fixed the Input Debugger not displaying some content correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Pico controllers using Controller Compatibility Mode.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR Home:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when hosting or joining rooms.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix rare crash when attempting to load render models.</li>
<li>Fix settings crash when navigating to “Developer” in SteamVR Settings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Link:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix excess CPU usage that could occur when the performance graph was never visible during a session.</li>
<li>New frame pacing: Improves “popping,” judder, and other smoothness / latency issues for controllers or other animated content. Note this change does affect timing for VR applications on the host PC; please report any new gameplay issues.</li>
</ul>
<strong>OpenXR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Support XR_KHR_locate_spaces.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where apps that didn’t submit projection layers would see a 100ms wait on alternating frames with some drivers.</li>
<li>When a requested time querying xrLocateSpace is outside of reasonable bounds, return XR_SUCCESS with an empty pose, instead of returning XR_ERROR_TIME_INVALID.</li>
<li>Support XR_META_recommended_layer_resolution.</li>
<li>Register SteamVR as an available runtime in the Windows Registry when SteamVR is defaulted to the active runtime.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Developer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>UX architecture improvements to improve consistency with Steam, including library versions and error handling.</li>
<li>Improved UX for 'mirrored device debug rendering'.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Former Humble Bundle staff launch new bundle site Digiphile to &#34;benefit users, creators, publishers, and charity&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from veterans of Humble Bundle, a new bundle site has launched named Digiphile as the creators want to help you discover new games and support charity. They're calling the packs <em>collections</em>.</p>
<p>Why another bundle site? They were "Frustrated with the shortcomings of current bundle sites", and noted how there's so many thousands of games releasing on Steam each year and they believe the solution "isn't more choice, but better curation" to help you find games that are worth playing. With their collections aiming to "bring back the good old days of bundles, with no more than one premium offering at a time, functioning as community-wide events that include curator engagement, guest curator deep dives, and more features to come".</p>
<p>Interestingly, they have a sort-of key exchange system too. You can trade in a key for a game you already have to earn credits towards a title from a previous collection. They're also promising none of the key issues that plague Humble Bundle a bit lately, with keys being reserved the moment you checkout.</p>
<p>With the charity side of it, you can optionally add extra to your purchases to give more money to selected charities while also grabbing some bonus content with the collection.</p>
<p>From the press release: "Working at Humble Bundle was a dream come true for a fan like me. And I'm not alone. We were all fans of Humble Bundle even before we worked there”, said Digiphile Founder Alex Hill. “Now we’re committed to staying true to Humble’s spirit and building what we loved about it in the first place."</p>
<p>Fully independent and self-funded too, so they don't answer to some bigger company constantly chasing a bigger profit at the expense of everything and everyone else.</p>
<p>A first collection "Return of the Immersive Sim" is due to go live today featuring System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, Perepiteia, Shadows of Doubt, Fallen Aces, Blood West, System Shock and CTRL ALT EGO. Not entirely sure exactly when, it appeared briefly for me earlier, then vanished on the next refresh. The press release did not give an exact time for it.</p>
<p>Well, it's clearly another bundle site but at least they're really <em>trying</em> to be different by the sounds of it. Will be fun to see how this evolves and if they bring out some good bundles. I'm certainly not complaining, I do love a good deal.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.6 to get a great new feature - limit virtual desktops to the primary screen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work never ends to improve the KDE Plasma desktop environment for Linux, and with Plasma 6.6 a fun new feature is coming to tweak virtual desktops.</p>
<p>What is it? A virtual desktop acts like having multiple screens on one screen, allowing you to flick between them. You could have specific things open ready on one, ready to swap over to it whenever you need. It can be really useful. However, currently on KDE Plasma the virtual desktop applies to all screens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13053175211762879953gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13053175211762879953gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - KDE Plasma, multiple virtual desktops.</em></p>
<p>That's going to change with KDE Plasma 6.6, as a new option has <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/910" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">been added</a> to let you configure the behaviour between the current way, and limiting it only to your primary screen. This sounds great, there's a lot of times I want something to always stay on (like emails or Discord) while swapping around on my main screen and this would be perfect for that.</p>
<p>Plus more features and bug fixes coming as noted in the latest Plasma development <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/11/08/this-week-in-plasma-virtual-desktops-only-on-the-primary-screen/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post roundup</a>.</p>
<p>Plasma 6.6 should be due out in February 2026.</p>

      <title>Pill-popping medical horror Side Effects from Free Lives arrives November 21</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love the idea of Buckshot Roulette meets medical horror, so I'm keen to see what all the pill-popping fuss is about with Side Effects. We don't have long to wait, as it's been announced that it's arriving on November 21st for solo play and up to 4 people online together.</p>
<p>Coming from Free Lives who made the likes of Terra Nil, Broforce, Gorn, Stick it to the Stickman and Angerfoot - I think it's safe to say we're in for a good time here.</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to Side Effects: a tense, turn-based medical roulette game. Each round you'll be presented with a selection of pills. Some are helpful, some are harmful, and some mean instant death. You never know what you're about to consume or what it might do to your mind or body. Winning means outlasting – AKA, outliving – your opponent across the table."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UMMnkX2UKqA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/33f48d72cc7768af14538651c2a80d2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UMMnkX2UKqA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resist</strong> - Every pill impacts your resistance. Manage it wisely: zero resistance means death.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment - </strong>Between rounds, you can choose from a range of experimental items and treatments that can shift the odds in your favor, from vaccines to mouth clamps.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>You’re not alone</strong> - The other patient wants to outlast you. They’ll bluff, adapt, and use everything at their disposal to keep breathing one dose longer than you.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The full version of the game will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single player mode.</li>
<li>Free Healthcare (endless mode).</li>
<li>Multiplayer mode (2-4 players!).</li>
<li>20+ unique items .</li>
<li>6 pill types to test.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Instead of racing in Backseat Champions you manage an AI driver like an auto-battling racer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Backseat Champions has a pretty clever idea, bringing the worlds of auto-battlers and roguelites to racing games with you managing an AI driver. <em>You're not quite literally in the backseat but close enough.</em></p>
<p>The game will feature races that are basically a short burst around the track, that's hopefully good for people who don't have a lot of time. The developer says it will allow you to "quickly hop in and get straight to the action" across real races, with "nothing scripted" where each race is different. You can play alone, or with friends too. During the race you pick various random upgrades, in the hope of making the fastest car to win. Not just that but you'll be able to manipulate the car in a few other ways too, and you'll also be dealing with dynamic weather.</p>
<p>From what I've seen and read, this seems like a seriously cool idea. Love it. I'm truly <em>awful</em> at driving games, but still getting in on the action through managing a driver directly? That sounds fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4Vl9b_HE1w0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f5ba8bca97aca32be7d97351bd3b7d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4Vl9b_HE1w0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>However, before you go jumping in worried about any generative AI, it's not that. It's the good old fashioned game AI. As the developer explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The drivers are powered by reinforcement learning using conventional, non-generative neural network models.</p>
<p>All training was done from scratch using self-made training environments built within the 50+ tracks of the game, and run from personal servers.</p>
<p>No copyrighted material, or third-party data, was used during the development of the game. All assets were created either by commissioned artists or myself.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular MangoHud performance display for Linux has a new release coming that's now ready for testing, with v0.8.2-rc1 now up.

      <title>Final Sentence is a unique horror battle royale where you&#39;re all on typewriters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Type accurately and fast, as your life depends on it in Final Sentence. It's a unique blend of battle royale and horror with typing game mechanics.</p>
<p>Quite clever sounding, and looks to be challenging too. There's a demo still currently available, which has proven to be quite popular with over 559,000 players downloading it during the last Steam Next Fest. The full game will feature online typing battles for 40-100 players, along with friends-only games so you can pick how you want to play it. Sounds absolutely horrifying, I can't spell properly half the time (thanks for all the corrections), so this would count me out in a game pretty quickly I think.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tl07u6hQP4E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2fe61ae72b85e7f39bbdb0e924bb7cce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tl07u6hQP4E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle Royale on Typewriters - You’ve never played anything like this before. Type fast and type accurately — your life depends on it. There's a revolver pointed at your head… with one bullet in the chamber.</li>
<li>Beat Your Friends - Play with strangers in massive rooms of 40 to 100 players — or battle it out in private matches with 4 or 8 friends.</li>
<li>Deep Stats and Ranked System - Every achievement is tracked and compared with others. See your progress. Know exactly where you're improving — and where you're falling behind.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is due out sometime in Q1 2026</p>

      <title>The classic Unreal Tournament gets a big upgrade with the v469e patch from OldUnreal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team from OldUnreal have put up a rather big patch for the classic Unreal Tournament, bringing lots of improvements and fixes to the classic Epic shooter.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, back in December, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/classic-unreal-tournament-and-unreal-now-easier-to-download-free-thanks-to-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty much gave it the official stamp of approval</a> too setting the game free with the full thing available via the Internet Archive. Epic also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/epic-games-update-the-unreal-tournament-website-linking-to-the-free-downloads-from-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">directly link to OldUnreal</a> too. Using the updated releases from OldUnreal is absolutely the best way to play the game, and pretty much required for online play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8298492581762876578gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8298492581762876578gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Unreal Tournament on Linux</em></p>
<p>I won't list everything that's changed here in Unreal Tournament v469e as the changelog is <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md#unreal-tournament-version-469e-release-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pretty darn long</a> but the main highlights included apart from <strong>tons</strong> of bug fixes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We added dozens of major quality-of-life features to Unreal Editor</li>
<li>Our Windows patches now include two great DirectX 11-based renderers: Metallicafan212's ICBINDx11 and dpJudas' D3D11Drv. These renderers offer great performance, low input latency, and lots of features. However, they will only work on recent versions of Windows and require a somewhat recent GPU</li>
<li>Apple users rejoice! This patch includes a brand new renderer that will talk to your machine using Apple's Metal API. You can enable this new renderer by setting the GameRenderDevice option in the [Engine.Engine] section of your game ini to Frucore.FrucoreRenderDevice. Please note that we couldn't call this renderer MetalDrv because that name is still taken by the renderer that targets S3's Metal API</li>
<li>The Windows and Linux patches now ship with dpJudas' VulkanDrv</li>
<li>By popular request, we added widescreen FOV scaling to the game (thanks Masterkent!)</li>
<li>The in-game server browser now needs much less time to populate the server list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest way to install it on Linux is actually via their own install script, which downloads the game and patches for you. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>In my own testing today, the resolution was incorrect so I had to edit the full-screen mode to get it to display properly. You can find the settings in "/UnrealTournament/System64/UnrealTournament.ini", when I put "StartupFullscreen" to False it loaded properly and displayed correctly after.</p>

      <title>Sentry gets improved crash reporting for games running via Proton / Wine on SteamOS / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://sentry.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sentry</a> is a toolkit for game devs to monitor errors, performance and more and now it should work a lot better on Linux / SteamOS with Wine / Proton. While the Sentry developers discovered the issues on SteamOS due to games running on Steam Deck, their improvements apply to Linux as a whole for any compatibility layer based on Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>What happened? They detailed in a <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/not-so-mini-dumps-how-we-found-missing-crashes-on-steamos/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> how a game developer sent in a support ticket to note they were getting <em>no</em> information from crashes on Steam Decks. Sentry developers realised it worked fine in Linux builds, but not in Windows games running through Proton.</p>
<p>Strangely they saw that non-fatal errors worked just fine and the logs were all sent. The problem with crashes, they ended up figuring out was that each crash dump was over <em>500mb</em> whereas a typical Windows crash dump would be "50-80 KB" and so "Something was catastrophically wrong" they said. This is far over their size limit for what was being sent, and it makes sense, imagine the Sentry systems getting sent tons of large packages like that - it would cause problems fast.</p>
<p>It all gets a bit technical from there, talking about capturing memory and leading onto finding an issue with Wine (which Proton is based on). Not a bug in Wine though, just part of how it works that led to this issue. As a result, they made multiple improvements to their system to account for it and they're now detecting Wine / Proton automatically in their SDK for game developers. And, as a bonus, developers can actually track Wine / Proton issues separately which sounds rather useful.</p>
<p>They said the fix is already in their Unreal Engine SDK and their own Sentry Native SDK for custom game engines, and it's coming soon for Unity and Godot SDKs. Side-note: Sentry also recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/godotengine.org/post/3m4zuvbllus2a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">started sponsoring</a> Godot too.</p>
<p>What does this all actually mean? It will be easier for developers to track down and fix issues with their games running on Linux systems via Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>Pretty cool to see how SteamOS on the Steam Deck is having such a wide effect across the industry, leading to all sorts of toolkits getting better overall Linux support. <em>Long may it continue.</em></p>

      <title>Talking point - what have you been playing lately?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello GamingOnLinux readers! It's time again to open up the floor as they say so jump into the comments and give your latest recommendations.</p>
<p>I don't think I really need to talk much more about what I've been playing, because it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite obviously ARC Raiders whenever I get the chance to</a>. I now have somehow lost 45 hours of my life to this thing, to the point where I've been <em>dreaming</em> about running through it. How wild. This is also another great excuse to show off some more cool screenshots I took during my runs of it. You might have spotted the dance party me and a few other random groups had in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-experimental-gets-fixes-for-multiple-xbox-game-studios-titles-arc-raiders-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent Proton Experimental update article</a> too.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders is just screenshot bait quite often, it really does some fantastic things with lighting and world-building that I keep coming across things thinking "oooh cool!", and then bang — dead. Another raider comes over to take everything from me, although I went in with a free loadout. Hah, sucker! Enjoy your <em>nothing</em>!</p>
<p>Here's a few snaps a took recently:</p>

<p>Apologies to the partner, they had to buy a copy because I'm so hooked on it. But hah, now they are too!</p>
<p>ARC Raiders is doing some impressive numbers on Steam too, hitting an all-time peak player count of 462,488 recently. That's a lot, especially when you consider it's a multi-platform game. It's been beating the likes of Battlefield 6 and Rust, even coming pretty close to the constant player count of PUBG.</p>
<p>So, what have you been playing lately (and why isn't it ARC Raiders?).</p>

      <title>Crimson Freedom could be one to watch for single-player RTS fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you like single-player RTS games with a proper narrative to go with it? You may want to keep a close eye on the upcoming Crimson Freedom. The developer has just announced it with a gameplay reveal to show it off, and it looks promising.</p>
<p>Set on 22nd-century Mars, the game follows the struggle of different ideologies battling for supremacy over the red planet and the future of humanity. Their aim with it is to revive "the golden age of RTS, combining sophisticated base building, complex army composition, and vital resource control, but enhances them with a modern user experience and thoughtful innovations". Coming with three factions each with unique units, tech and strengths.</p>
<p>A single-player first game with what is planned to have "25+ hours" of gameplay during the campaign, with another planned "15+" hours in an update after release. It will also have skirmish battles and they're planning on 1v1 online multiplayer too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HCP65C1ti-s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a93d08d661dcd16d40b151282fdf18b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HCP65C1ti-s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said a demo should hopefully be up in December.</p>
<p>“We built Crimson Freedom to be the RTS we always wanted to play, a deep strategy game with a story worth uncovering,” said Marko Gardijan, Game Producer at Yboga Studios. “Each campaign offers a radically different perspective on the struggle for humanity's future. You’re not just building armies, you’re exploring the moral gray area of the red planet, and the choices and failures of humanity.”</p>
<p>All sounds promising, and graphically looks pretty good too. With this sort of RTS being a favourite, I'm looking forward to giving it a try.</p>

      <title>The EasySMX X05 Pro wireless controller is cheap, feature-filled and comfortable with a big flaw</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The EasySMX X05 Pro was sent over for review and after spending weeks with it, this little device <em>nearly</em> turned into a favourite.</p>
<p>Let's get all the good bits out of the way first shall we? A controller designed to remove wires from your life, while also keeping the cost down. I'm genuinely surprised at just how cheap this is (around £30), while also feeling amazing to hold and play games with. It seems truly shocking how good the EasySMX X05 Pro actually is for the price.</p>
<p>What's also nice is how wonderfully quiet it is. The only noise you actually hear is the slight click from pushing in the thumbsticks, every other button is pretty much a whisper, which is great for family life or for those of you like me who really do get irritated by loud controller clicks. Even though it's all muted, all of the buttons still feel good on the feedback from pressing them. Even the D-Pad actually feels quite nice on this, with a clear click you can feel for the direction pressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2091738671762789313gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2091738671762789313gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It has 1000mAh battery, dual-stage vibration triggers, a two-stage trigger lock system to swap between quick clicks and long pulls of the triggers, hall effect joysticks to help fight against stick drift, and compared with previous models they upgraded the D-Pad to help stop any missed diagonals.</p>
<p>The device supports 2.4Ghz wireless via a USB dongle supplied with it, Bluetooth and USB-C Wired.</p>
<p>You also get a bit of fancy lighting on it, which I know how some feel about everything having some form of RGB nowadays - but you can adjust the lighting directly on the controller, no need for an app. You can swap it between a dynamic moving colour bar, a breathing animation with different colours, a solid colour or none at all. <em>Yes, you can turn the RGB completely off.</em></p>
<p>There's also two extra buttons on the top between the triggers and shoulder buttons (M1 &amp; M2). These also don't need an extra app to configure, you can do it all on the controller directly which works perfectly. You just hold down the M button in the middle, with either M1 or M2 and it will flash red to tell you it's ready, then tap the button you want to assign it and press M again and it's done. No fuss at all. Nice!</p>
<p>Plug and play on my Linux Desktop and Steam Deck too, absolutely no issues with input there thanks to Steam Input.</p>
<p>For me, the most important thing was comfort. And I don't know exactly what it is about it, but I find it far more comfortable than my 8BitDo Ultimate and Ultimate 2. It just seems to fit into my hands a whole lot better. It's really nice to hold.</p>
<p>That's all the good stuff, and now onto why I cannot currently recommend anyone purchase it.</p>
<p>The EasySMX X05 Pro looks and feels like a premium controller. It is <em>so</em> close to perfect it's unreal. However, it has one absolutely massive glaring flaw that needs to be dealt with. The triggers are a <em>problem</em>. If you press the triggers a couple of times quickly when in long travel mode (the default / normal trigger experience), it will then incorrectly detect some light pressing as if you're fully pulling on the triggers. Let's say you pull down on triggers three times lightly, after that it will always act like you've pulled it down all the way to 100%, like you've enabled the locks on the back of the device for trigger clicks. You have to pull the triggers down hard to max to get it to reset and act normally again and it will happen constantly. This <em>seems</em> like a software issue, so if they can do a firmware update to solve that trigger problem, it would be pretty much perfection.</p>
<p>It's sad to end the review on such a technical problem, and the controller will now gather dust until that is solved as that's a complete deal-breaker for me.</p>

      <title>D7VK brings Direct3D 7 to Linux using Vulkan based on DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've have DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for various versions of Direct3D on Linux, but now it seems we're also getting Direct3D 7 as well.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page the developer describes how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7, which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine. It uses DXVK's d3d9 backend as well as Wine's ddraw implementation (or the windows native ddraw) and acts as a proxy between the two, providing a minimal d3d7-on-d3d9 implementation. The project is currently in its early days. Expect most things to run, but not necessarily correctly or optimally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project has only recently had a first public release on GitHub (about two weeks ago), but a fresh update on November 5th should make it a whole lot better. As the developer said: "After focusing a bit on performance tuning, things are now anywhere between decent to stellar in most of the supported games".</p>
<p>Sounds like the intent is to keep it as a standalone project, and not merge it into DXVK. Pretty cool to see though, amazing for game preservation to get even more retro Windows games running and most importantly performing well on Linux where even modern Windows will likely struggle with some.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16389232301762787818gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Star Trek: Armada</em></p>
<p>It won't work with every Direct3D 7 game though, things were a bit messy back then with various APIs. The developers notes "d3d7 is a land of highly cursed API inter-operability, and applications that for one reason or another mix and match d3d7 with older ddraw (not ddraw7) and/or with GDI are not expected to ever work". With that in mind, it might also never be an official part of Proton (and certainly not Wine directly) - so this isn't some world-changing thing for Linux (or Steam Deck), but really cool to see anyway.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Direct3D_2-7_games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamingWiki</a>, there's quite a number of games that use Direct3D 7.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">find it on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>THRASHER is thoroughly weird and it&#39;s out now as the follow up to THUMPER</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not entirely sure what I thought of THRASHER but it's certainly a unique experience and it's officially out now with Linux / Steam Deck support. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>For people who played the game THUMPER, this comes from the artist &amp; composer behind it. Not a game I've actually played before, so I went in entirely cold on it. But what I do know, is that they're very different games. Where THUMPER is a rhythm game, THRASHER is an arcade-style smasher that sees you go through some very strange worlds to defeat a bunch of unusual looking otherworldly boss creatures.</p>
<p>The whole thing is just thoroughly <em>odd</em>. I like bizarre stuff though, and this is very much out there. You control a floaty space eel, and the idea is to smash through various moving objects as quickly as you possibly can to progress. Your time left is your score and so you need to be <em>fast</em>. It's all about the leaderboards here to beat your own time, and times from others across the world. Going into it the game feels like some sort of hypnotic psychedelic-infused version of the classic Snake almost, it's really hard to describe. Make the eel move around, smash through objects, while avoiding hazards that take away precious seconds you need or destroy them if you have time. That's really it on the basics.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ilm63FtWc4U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d1351ebd5b591bed867e84ce1167efc3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ilm63FtWc4U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The boss battles are very much the same as the normal stages, just tweaked a little with you smashing into an orb at the end of extra boss-battle rounds to then have your eel fly directly into their face to hurt them. If anything, the boss battles are a bit anticlimactic as the game ends up feeling rather samey as you go through.</p>
<p>But, it does expand and open up just a bit as you progress through it with it introducing power-ups, so it's worth it if you stick through it enough to see through the first bunch of realms as there's 27 stages across 9 very different realms to play. You don't necessarily have to be amazing at it to keep beating your times either, as it will allow you to progress regardless.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like a game should be more of a fit for VR, and considering it's supported in VR and was first released for VR, that makes a <em>lot</em> of sense. Although it still works fine as a flatscreen game with either mouse or gamepad, and all ways of controlling it do feel a little bit different.</p>
<p>Overall, it's properly unique. I'm struggling to clearly note down how I feel about it. Visually distinct from anything else, with audio to make it feel a little out of this world. If you like the idea of something firmly different to everything else releasing right now, perhaps give it a go. And as a bonus, it only takes a few hours to complete it.</p>
<p>Not quite the strangest game I've played this year (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/tingus-goose-is-one-of-the-weirdest-games-ive-ever-seen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tingus Goose</a> wins that) but pretty close to it. I just wished there was something more to it. A lot of it was simply too easy, because it wants you to rush to beat those times and everything surrounds that.</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment is still probably the best survivor-like with The Boglands DLC and free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Possibly still the absolute best action-roguelike survivor-like ever made, Halls of Torment has expanded with The Boglands DLC and a big free update. <em>Note: a DLC key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>What is it? Halls of Torment looks a bit like the original classic Diablo, but its gameplay is based on Vampire Survivors. You pick a character class, and then run through a series of different halls to take down as many enemies as possible, while collecting experience to level up and completely over-power your character. It has the delicious sort of action that allows you to completely hyper-focus on it as you just tear through enemy after enemy. It gives the kind of pure chaos towards the end of a run that you can't help but appreciate it.</p>
<p>Check out The Boglands release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mbBMxS9TdM8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5caf79c2668a6e51c431e6e31f453b9f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mbBMxS9TdM8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It already had a <em>lot</em> of content to play through with multiple characters each with their own style, along with multiple rooms to battle through and lots of quests and now there's just more of it? The Boglands <em>should</em> be a no-brainer. The main problem with the DLC though, is that you need to have spent quite a long time in the game to actually be able to unlock the new content, because it requires hunting down potion ingredients across different halls (maps) to access it. A problem amplified by the 30 minute runs every time, which just feels a bit too long. It never wastes your time, but 30 minutes every time feels like a lot. I think I've been spoiled by the many other survivor-likes that have released with more compact runs.</p>
<p>Not an issue for seasoned players I imagine, maybe I'm just rubbish and that required me to put more time into it due to many failed runs, but I think you have to be <em>really</em> into Halls of Torment for the DLC to actually be worth it. Some of the enemy combinations really are tough to beat when put together. Then again, all it takes is one seriously good run to complete a whole bunch of quests, I think I was just unlucky at the start. </p>
<p>Thankfully, with all the quests you get to go through and their various rewards, I think it's worth it. Especially if you do enjoy over-powering your characters and constantly trying out new combinations using the special abilities you pick up from the maps and defeating the mini-bosses.</p>
<p>As for the DLC content, the new characters and maps certainly add a different flavour to the game, that may not be to everyone's tastes but it's fun to see the developers trying to do something a little different with it. It's been a little unstable and unbalanced since the DLC release though, but it's getting better after a couple of patches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21105913891762783290gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21105913891762783290gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>DLC Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New Stage:</strong><br/>
	Trudge through a murky swamp teeming with insects, spirits, and ancient walking trees. Time is not your enemy here—<em>survival is</em>. Victory lies not in the grains of sand in the hourglass, but in the piles of slain foes.</li>
<li><strong>Two New Heroes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>The Crone</em></strong> summons twisted plant life to ensnare enemies and spread <strong>Decay</strong>, a creeping affliction that weakens defense and shatters block chance.</li>
<li><strong><em>The Alchemist</em></strong> hurls volatile mixtures imbued with elemental powers—customizable for fire, ice, lightning, or earth. He thrives in chaos, and favors builds that harness multiple elements at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>50+ New Quests:</strong><br/>
	Earn rewards by experimenting with new mechanics, braving the Boglands, and mastering your tools.</li>
<li><strong>New Abilities &amp; Gear:</strong><br/>
	Unlock three new abilities and a dozen new items—each designed to synergize with the Crone's control and the Alchemist's raw elemental creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Decay Mechanic &amp; Earth Element:</strong><br/>
	Unleash the new <strong>Earth</strong> element and apply <strong>Decay</strong>—a long-lasting, armor-cracking curse that softens even the toughest foes.</li>
<li><strong>6 New Artifacts:</strong><br/>
	Customize your runs with powerful stage modifiers. Risk meets reward as these ancient objects twist the rules to your favor—or demise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Traits. More Blessings. More Ways to Die.</strong><br/>
Expand your build potential with potion-focused blessings and new traits waiting to be uncovered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there's also the free update that gives you The Bard as a new end-game character with their own unique abilities too, along with a few assorted other new items sprinkled into the game. Plus, some bug fixes and balancing changes and a few bits of improvements for gamepad controller players. I haven't seen any controller issues since the update, it all feels like a perfect fit for a gamepad.</p>
<p>It's still easily one of the best designed survivor-likes available today. Not played it before? You're in for a treat.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint to get an upgraded System Information tool and a spruced up system menu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new blog post is out from the Linux Mint team going over some recent work, with the newer Cinnamon Menu coming along nicely and a new System Information tool.</p>
<p>For the Cinnamon Menu that's getting a refresh, it's looking really good. They've recently added the ability to move the search bar and the system buttons. While it might not be one of the fanciest features around, the menu is your window into your system and so it needs to work well. Compared with the current Cinnamon menu, it definitely looks and feels a lot more modern and useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4762661291762775049gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Additionally, they've announced a rebrand of the original System Reports tool. It's now going to be called System Information, which will give you a better readout of your system in a (hopefully) easy to understand way. It's been expanded with 4 new pages of system details like a USB page for plugged in devices, a GPU page, a PCI page and a BIOS page.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377850501762775276gol1.png"/></p>
<p>One thing I always find missing from these system info apps is your current Mesa driver version. KDE is the same with the About this System page. We get things like the Kernel version, graphics card, processor and so on - but the Mesa driver version just seems like it would be a good fit to add don't you think?</p>

      <title>The popular Easy Effects app swaps from GTK over to Qt, QML and Kirigami with a big new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally known as PulseEffects, Easy Effects is an audio manipulation tool for Linux that provides many different useful effects and filters. Hold on a minute, this isn't a game? Correct! But, it's still an incredibly useful application for Linux, and can also be useful for anyone doing any recording and streaming on Linux!</p>
<p>A big new release has been put out with Easy Effects 8.0.0 that completely overhauls the interface, along with a built-in tray icon and menu. Not only that, the app is friendlier to smaller screens, some plugins saw a few improvements, there's bug fixes and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15646219571762774504gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's looking great on my Kubuntu desktop, might actually have to start messing around with it some more.</p>
<p>Changelog for Easy Effects 8.0.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is our first release using a combination of Qt, QML and Kirigami instead of gtk4. As a result our graphical interface went through major changes.</li>
<li>Now we have a built-in tray icon and menu. Among other things the tray menu shows a list of most used input and output presets.</li>
<li>Our window is now more friendly to small screens. As a result it is friendlier than before to tiling window managers too.</li>
<li>EasyEffects now remembers the last used plugin or tab and restores them when the window is reopened.</li>
<li>The previous global bypass button is now exposed as a [traditional] on/off button.</li>
<li>Out presets menu became a presets window that now has a third tab dedicated for autoloading profiles.</li>
<li>It is now possible to set a fallback autoloading profile. If the fallback is enabled the selected fallback preset is applied for any soundcard or microphone that does not have an autoloading profile.</li>
<li>The preset autoloading tab shows the current routing of the selected input/output device.</li>
<li>Presets can be renamed in our presets window.</li>
<li>Presets backup can be made in our presets window.</li>
<li>Our spectrum is now [drawn] by Qt Graphs. For now only Qt color presets are allowed but this may change in the future.</li>
<li>We added more shortcuts as well as global shortcuts for the global effects on/off and the microphone monitor.</li>
<li>Dry and wet controls were implemented for the convolver and pitch plugins.</li>
<li>The pitch plugin now has a button that allows its history to be reset.</li>
<li>The crystalizer plugin now has an adaptive intensity mode.</li>
<li>Our echo canceller is now based on the webrtc library instead of speexdsp. This should improve echo cancellation quality for many users.</li>
<li>Our manual is now displayed inside our window through WebEngineView. Yelp is not necessary anymore.</li>
<li>The test signal tab now can generate pink noise.</li>
<li>We added a configuration option that allows the microphone monitor output to be sent to the output effects pipeline input.</li>
<li>We added a new Autogain parameter that allows the output level to be forced to zero when the input level is below the silence threshold.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility with the latest Linux Studio Plugins releases.</li>
<li>We are now able to show Calf Studio Plugins native window. This requires the calf package to be built with its native window.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GZDoom successor project UZDoom gets a first preview release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">After the GZDoom implosion</a>, the rest of the developers split off to form UZDoom and the first preview release has rolled out with some essential improvements.</p>
<p>This release is supposed to be a directly follow-up to GZDoom 4.14.2 with UZDoom keeping the versioning just bumping it up to UZDoom 4.14.3. As the <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/UZDoom_version_history/prerelease#4.14.3_(xx_11_2025)" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> notes, updating to this is deemed "critical" as it has multiple security fixes. With UZDoom they also aim to address some historically contentious issues in the ZDoom community with a change to some of the defaults, to make it closer to how Doom originally looked. That, and, make it easier for users since the current amount of options can be a bit overloading.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10795478991762773389gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom 2 with UZDoom</em></p>
<p>Changes from GZDoom 4.14.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple security fixes. <strong>This update is being deemed as critical.</strong> It’s highly recommended to upgrade to it.</li>
<li>Added new game-based cursors (courtesy of Nash Muhandes). These are much more cursor-y, and very good at pointing and clicking on things.</li>
<li>Changed defaults to be more balanced between vanilla and modern.</li>
<li>Lowered the master volume so it's less likely to blow out the system audio and become muffled (especially with things like the Plasma Rifle firing sound).</li>
<li>Added the Default option for automap colors, allowing the automap to choose based on which game is being played.</li>
<li>Added a Display option to control the render style of rocket explosions (these now default to additive instead of translucent since we felt it visually fit the other projectiles better).</li>
<li>Made the mouse less sensitive in menus when it’s been dormant for a short period. This should help reduce it accidentally shifting the selected option randomly while idle.</li>
<li>Added the <em>powerup_fade_scalar</em> cvar for controlling the strength of the fade on power ups (e.g. the Radiation Suit’s green tint).</li>
<li>Added support for the <strong>BUSY</strong> script flag for ACS.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not muting properly when the game is unfocused, causing it to build up and play back explosively in certain cases (especially for multiplayer games).</li>
<li>Fixed the master volume not properly applying to music when the game starts up.</li>
<li>Fixed weapon bobbing not disabling correctly when manually set to 0 via cvar.</li>
<li>Fixed the wrong music being played during Strife’s bad endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the opening subtitle for Strife not displaying.</li>
<li>Fixed the Iron Lich’s whirlwind blaming the wrong target for its damage dealt.</li>
<li>Fixed the textured automap being broken.</li>
<li>Fixed mid textures clipping incorrectly when skewed.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with VisualThinkers when loading from a save.</li>
<li>Fixed IQM models with decoupled animations not displaying correctly if spawned without an animation.</li>
<li>Fixed gun flashes from MBF21 weapons not displaying correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with <strong>CreateTossable</strong> where items wouldn’t be removed if their amount was 0.</li>
<li>Fixed Quat’s <strong>Conjugate</strong> and <strong>Inverse</strong> functions throwing a JIT error.</li>
<li>Fixed the BrokenLines class being unserializable.</li>
<li>Fixed level data fields e.g. Sector not being cleared properly when transitioning between levels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can test it out by downloading it via <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can also follow UZDoom on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/uzdoom.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be the start of plenty of improvements and a long life for UZDoom and the ZDoom community.</p>

      <title>Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) is now free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Previously known as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/virtual-tabletop-app-fantasy-grounds-unity-appears-on-steam-with-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fantasy Grounds Unity</a>, the developers at SmiteWorks have now made Fantasy Grounds VTT free to play.</p>
<p>Originally, this virtual tabletop required someone to spend at least $50 for an Ultimate License (or a monthly fee) to be able to actually host a game with it. Now, all users gain access to the platform without having to spend anything. While the base software is now free there's tons of content that is not including licensed packs like Alien, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and so on.</p>
<p>From the press release: "By removing the license barrier, we’re making Fantasy Grounds more accessible to the global tabletop gaming community," said Doug Davison, President of SmiteWorks. "Whether you’re a veteran GM or a first-time player, we want everyone to experience how powerful and immersive virtual tabletop gaming can be – with zero upfront cost."</p>
<p>They also made a rather odd trailer to go with the announcement:</p>

      <title>Steam&#39;s wider store page refresh is live with plans to improve the home page on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For a while now Valve have been tweaking Steam store pages, including making them a fair bit wider which is now actually live everywhere for all users.</p>
<p>This was originally available via the Steam Beta Client for Desktop <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-is-getting-wider-and-more-responsive-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since August</a>, and rolled out in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-update-gives-wider-store-pages-library-sorting-desktop-accessibility-controls-and-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September</a> on Desktop for everyone but now they've also put all the changes on the web store too not just the Steam Client. The pages have been widened from 940 pixels to now 1200 pixels, which may not be huge news but it definitely makes a difference. Especially for screenshots, since you'll see them at a higher resolution now too.</p>
<p>With this change the trailer / screenshot section also gained some new tricks with new viewing modes between a theatre mode and full-screen, with controls to scroll through them that's especially nice when looking over new games to just quickly tap through full screenshots directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5800837441762538569gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve also gave developers some new tools to make their game descriptions more interesting, store pages take a bit more background colour from the games too which is subtle but looks quite nice. Plus some other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search?term=&amp;snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Search results</a> are wider and each row is slightly taller giving a little more room for the game artwork to increase in size.</li>
<li>Bundle detail pages also now have slightly more colorful backgrounds and larger artwork in the list of contents.</li>
<li>Recommendation pages like the <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/recommender?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Interactive Recommender</a> and <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/friendactivity/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Popular Among Friends</a> are wider.</li>
<li>Store hubs such as for individual tags (eg. <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Supernatural?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>) have always been a little wider than game pages. We updated these now to all be the same width.</li>
<li><a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Charts</a> and <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">News Hub</a> were both slightly different sizes and even different sets of colors. These have been consolidated some to bring them more inline with Steam platform colors.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the main Steam home page, they said they have some "similar adjustments coming in the near future" but they're not ready to go live yet.</p>

      <title>OpenMW 0.50.0 for Morrowind is out with more enhancements and better gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Morrowind just got even better with the new OpenMW 0.50.0 release, as the free and open source game engine reimplementation has some big fancy new features.</p>
<p>One of the headliners being vastly improved gamepad support, allowing you to play through it properly and interact with the UI. This is going to make it a whole lot nicer to play on handhelds like the Steam Deck. They've also made "foundational steps in dehardcoding combat, further expands our Lua scripting API and, among the host of user interface fix-ups, introduces the highly requested quick item transfer".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19276896261762533074gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This brings a new Controller Menus option in the launcher, which slightly adjusts the in-game UI allowing you to use the "controller action buttons to navigate more conveniently through the slightly altered in-game UI" no longer limiting you to the combination of emulated mouse input.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's a lot they've improved elsewhere including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better NPC AI pathfinding.</li>
<li>Improvements to sneaking.</li>
<li>Settings are now actually saved when you exit the settings, not the game itself.</li>
<li>Improved graphics compatibility with various modded assets.</li>
<li>Fixes for normal mapping and parallax mapping graphics issues.</li>
<li>Some big improvements to scripting for modders, like allowing modders to manipulate the weather.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mass Effect&#39;s SSV Normandy SR1 Returns to No Man&#39;s Sky with a re-run of previous expeditions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games are giving us all another chance to grab some cool stuff in No Man's Sky, like Mass Effect's SSV Normandy SR1 with various expeditions. <em>They're bringing back different expeditions to celebrate another year.</em></p>
<p>What exactly are expeditions? They're special time-limited events where you're given a series of tasks to do, and going through them will net you some special rewards.</p>
<p>The re-run expedition timeline starts today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Beachhead: 7th Nov - 18th | Nov The inhabitants of the Space Anomaly have detected something impossible: a fluctuation in history already written. A new pattern is emerging in the stories of the ancient Gek, Korvax, and Vy’keen. Something is coming: a legendary weapon that always appears whenever it is needed...</li>
<li>Titan: 19th Nov - 2nd Dec | Chart a dazzling array of new stars and new worlds formed in Worlds Part II: gas giants, endless oceans and cloud-skimming mountains. Earn exclusive rewards, including a unique living ship dredged from the inky depths of a water world.</li>
<li>Relics: 3rd Dec - 16th Dec | Sign up with the Galactic Palaeology Society and join the community on a journey to recreate ancient lifeforms, uncover secrets left undisturbed for millennia, and earn a complete living stone appearance override.</li>
<li>Corvette: 17th Dec - 30th Dec | Your former starship has been damaged beyond repair, and the Sentinel horde is closing in. Assemble your own corvette-class starship, maximise its stats and potential, and take refuge amongst the stars! Earn an array of exclusive rewards, including the one-of-a-kind Mecha Mouse robotic companion.</li>
<li>Breach: 31st Dec - 13th Jan | Traverse a desolate and abandoned universe, confronting both the awe and the horror that lurks in deep space. Follow the tale of the ill-faded Fireship Arcadia, step into zero-gravity, and scavenge modules from its wreckage to enhance your own corvette builds. Complete milestones to earn a set of ancient, powerful Atlas-themed corvette modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/275850/view/614305130088497378" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> ended with a reminder of work ongoing for their next game, but they also teased that "we already have so much more content planned and in active development" for No Man's Sky. I'm properly excited to see what else they have cooking, as they've added some really incredible features to the game over the last year or so through a bunch of major free updates.</p>

      <title>Lexispell is a roguelike word game where strategy meets physics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this looks like a cool mix, Lexispell brings some roguelike strategy flavour to word games with physics and the trailer easily sold me.</p>
<p>Dare I say it? I'm going to — it's another game that looks just a little bit inspired by <em>Balatro</em>. Yes, a name you've heard a lot I've no doubt, but Balatro has clearly inspired the UI design of a number of more casual games recently and this is another. Not that it's a bad thing, it looks lovely. The gameplay has a similar theme too, as you go through rounds of trying to beat the score but here it's done with words.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TRuNbAKeo8c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5399112ac895efd2dd7fe1dd48d0905.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TRuNbAKeo8c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Craft long words to score high</li>
<li>Merge, merge, merge = more points</li>
<li>Choose specific words to trigger cool upgrades</li>
<li>Defeat bosses with mind twisting rules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More than a roguelike - </strong>Explore various game modes: roguelike, time rush, jar puzzle and daily challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Cozy &amp; relaxing - </strong>Sit back, grab a hot drink, and spell your way to victory</p>
<p><strong>Interact how you want - </strong>Play with mouse, keyboard, touchscreen or controller. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It's actually being developed on Linux Mint too, so that's pretty cool.</em></p>

      <title>Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is getting delisted starting November 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slitherine / Black Lab Games have announced that the excellent strategy game Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is going to be removed from all stores.</p>
<p>They said "starting" on November 15th, that the game and all of its DLC "will no longer be available for purchase on any platform" and they wanted to "give everyone a proper heads-up to grab the game while it’s still available". If you already own it on platforms like Steam and GOG, you will still be able to play it, but no one else will be able to buy it once it's gone.</p>
<p>Another terrible hit for game preservation. It's such a huge shame when games are just removed like this. There's probably some sort of rights expiration behind the scenes for the removal, but we can only guess as they didn't give an actual reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19611405261762519157gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19611405261762519157gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>We do also have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> upcoming but it's a very different game. Still, at least there will be something expanding the Battlestar universe that I love so much.</p>
<p>If you want to grab Battlestar Galactica Deadlock before it's gone possibly forever, the GOG store has it on a 70% discount until the 17th.</p>

      <title>Co-op climbing game PEAK gets a big update with a new Roots biome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily still one of my favourite co-op games, PEAK just expanded with another big free content update so get ready to slide and fall some more. </p>
<p>The Roots biome has been added, which will be a random switch between it and Tropics when going through a run. It comes with new badges to earn, a bunch of new items in the new biome, an overhaul to the cooking system, funny new emotes and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dgOlgyjH7CI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bdd9db5f871325378f162d6a6651410.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dgOlgyjH7CI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All the changes in this update:</p>
<blockquote><strong>MAJOR FEATURES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added a new biome: the ROOTS.</li>
<li>11 new badges to earn, each with associated cosmetics to unlock as rewards!</li>
<li>New Roots-specific Items:
	<ul>
<li>ShroomberriesEach color of Shroomberry gives a random effect, which cycles out every day alongside the map. The best way to find out what they do is to try one! (Or feed one to an unsuspecting friend)</li>
<li>Fortified Milk</li>
<li>Cloud Fungus</li>
<li>Bounce Fungus</li>
<li>...And some more we won't tell you about!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New items that can spawn in every biome:
	<ul>
<li>Rescue Claw</li>
<li>Checkpoint Flag</li>
<li>Book of Bones (new mystical item!!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cooking Overhaul</li>
<li>8 NEW EMOTES!!!</li>
</ul>
<strong>MINOR FEATURES </strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can now join a game or be invited without first having the game open, provided Steam is open.</li>
<li>The divorce court has allowed Bing Bong to visit his kids on weekends.</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUG FIXES </strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can no longer point at stuff (ping) while unconscious</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where status over time (hunger, poison, etc) could result in the stamina bar being visually full of status, but the player would not pass out.</li>
<li>Extra stamina will now reset to 0 when a scout is killed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a reconnecting player could spawn with a different player's statuses/inventory.</li>
<li>The game will end properly if all living players disconnect, leaving only dead ones behind.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing items with limited uses to spontaneously regain all their uses sometimes.</li>
<li>Improved the interaction highlight on several items where it was missing or partially missing.</li>
<li>Updated a number of badge illustrations lightly for readability.</li>
<li>The Napberry Plant spawns again in the Alpine!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PEAK works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton and pretty great on Steam Deck too. Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. It's absolutely one of the highlights released in 2025, where me and friends have spent some of the most time together for our more casual gaming.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.17 released with fixes for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, OS Updates and Discover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest stable system update with SteamOS 3.7.17 now available bringing bug fixes, but also disabled wake-on-bluetooth for Steam Deck LCD.</p>
<p>The experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD has been repeatedly problematic, being enabled and disabled a few times now. Hopefully Valve can figure out the issues with it soon so all users can benefit from it, as it's especially useful when docking a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.17 release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="EventDetailsBody A_A2B6fTn_MPLlGCmsLtd">
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the performance overlay would sometimes not appear in Baldur's Gate 3.</li>
<li>Temporarily re-disabled experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD while issues with spurious wake-ups are investigated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could prevent updating from specific older builds of SteamOS.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the Discover app in desktop mode that could cause update failures in some scenarios.</li>
</ul>

      <title>CodeWeavers launch a new CrossOver Preview adding Linux ARM64 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gaming on Linux with ARM64 is about to get more interesting, with the team at CodeWeavers announcing a new CrossOver Preview. They said this has been years in the making through different releases of Wine gradually adding more of what's been needed.</p>
<p>What is CrossOver? It's from the team that support Wine development, which adds their own UI and tooling on top of Wine to make the experience a little bit easier, along with dedicated support. Some of their team also work with Valve on Proton.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2025/11/6/twist-our-arm64-heres-the-latest-crossover-preview" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In January 2024, ARM64 support was released in <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine 9.0</a> for running native Windows ARM binaries and emulated i386 code. In May 2024, the CrossOver team completed work making a native ARM64 CrossOver client. The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine 10.0</a> release in January 2025 included full support for ARM64EC to run emulated x86-64 code. Tackling ARM64EC involved not only significant Wine development, but also extensive compiler development to essentially implement a brand new architecture. The existing LLVM toolchain already had support for ARM64, and Wine developers worked on the ARM64EC support that was included in the LLVM 21 release. Finally, once ARM64EC development was complete in upstream Wine, the CrossOver team integrated <a href="https://fex-emu.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FEX</a> into CrossOver to handle i386 and x86-64 emulation and our QA team completed an extensive testing sweep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CodeWeavers have been testing on the <a href="https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra-a1.1-n1/configure" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">System76 Thelio Astra</a> which has an Ampere Altra CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti with Ubuntu 24.04. In their testing they were able to see these results:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Really interesting tech, and continues to show what's possible with open source. CodeWeavers' Meredith Johnson notes how "we envisage CrossOver as a viable solution for migrating enterprise Windows workloads to Linux for improved security and reduced bloat".</p>

      <title>The Falconeer gets a huge Revolution Remaster upgrade but drops Native Linux for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster is now available bringing a massive upgrade to the action-adventure game, but Linux gamers will now need to use Proton.</p>
<p>What is it? You take on the role of Falconeer, a powerful airborne warrior traversing a vast oceanic world torn apart by generations of poisonous decisions and dissent. Throughout multiple campaigns, you will experience life from many different perspectives and loyalties as you embark on a journey of discovery, and solve the mystery of the Ursee, its people and history.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3EErnxbh1Lc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c12dbdf9d60961139a7507e32c836659.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3EErnxbh1Lc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what the new edition update brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely overhauled visuals:</strong> rebuilt environments, redesigned warbirds, new lighting systems, and fully dynamic illumination that brings the skies of the Ursee to life.</li>
<li><strong>Refined flight controls:</strong> experience a smoother, faster, and more responsive aerial combat.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalanced missions:</strong> smarter enemies, faster pacing, and more epic encounters.</li>
<li><strong>The Edge of the World DLC:</strong> fully integrated into the base game, now remastered to the same high standard.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded lore and world:</strong> new settlements, visual storytelling, and subtle narrative updates deepen the Ursee’s mystery.</li>
<li><strong>Improved controls: </strong>a reworked single control scheme providing a more intuitive experience for players on mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>And More: </strong>New cosmetic armour sets and expanded voice acting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about dropping the Native Linux version the developer said: "The native Linux option has been removed. It's simply [too] much for me to support additional platforms for two games. The game runs good on Proton 9 and for now that is the official support. I hope Linux players can understand that for a Solodev there are constraints."</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and this release also came with some specific Steam Deck improvements too like a reduction in shadow quality, a new downsampling option and other performance adjustments and improvements.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) joins up with Open Collective Europe for funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hopefully making this excellent open source voxel game engine project more manageable, Luanti (formerly Minetest) has joined up with Open Collective Europe.</p>
<p>As announced in <a href="https://blog.luanti.org/2025/11/05/non-profit/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the blog post</a>, they now have a <a href="https://opencollective.com/luanti" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> where you can directly support the project. This should make it easier for people to donate and for the developers to access the funds to put towards things like hosting servers, promoting Luanti, supporting general development, reducing their legal risk with funding and so on. It should also make it easier for them to attend events like FOSDEM. On top of that, it makes things a lot more transparent too, as you can see what funds are going in and being used for what.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6191724161762434175gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Luanti has made some impressive progress over the last few years, with a lot of popular games available for it and the future is clearly looking bright for this free and open source voxel game engine.</p>
<p>See more about it on <a href="https://www.luanti.org/en/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the official site</a>.</p>

      <title>The open source FOSDEM event for 2026 will have a Gaming and VR devroom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FOSDEM is an important event for the open source community, and it seems like FOSDEM 2026 is going to be interesting for Linux gaming fans too.</p>
<p>They've revealed it's going to have a Gaming and VR devroom for the first time, and they're calling for participation. From the <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2025q4/003675.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gaming/VR devroom will focus on all Free and Open Source gaming, VR and related projects. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>- Open Games.<br/>
- Open VR software and hardware.<br/>
- Open gaming related hardware.<br/>
- Gaming and VR engines.<br/>
- Related components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said the deadline is "December 1st, 2026" but they most likely mean <u><strong>2025</strong></u> (woops), since the event takes place 31 January - 1 February 2026.</p>
<p>Anyone can submit a talk, so it will be interesting to see what happens with this one. We'll be keeping an eye on it. They're aiming for each talk to be no more than 25 minutes. However, you will have to be in-person to do a talk in Brussels (Belgium) on February 1st, 2026 for it.</p>
<p>It has been a big few years for Linux gaming, so it's not really surprising to see FOSDEM make more space for it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck tweaked to fix delays with the screen-off downloads, and other Desktop Linux fixes recently</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out another small Beta to fix up an issue with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steam-deck-gets-a-new-low-power-screen-off-downloads-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Deck screen-off downloads</a>, and some other Desktop Linux fixes that came recently.</p>
<p>I'm seriously happy to see this feature land, and it has been working really nicely in my testing when loading up both my Steam Decks with some more games.</p>
<p>Here's what Valve tweaked for the Steam Deck in the November 5th Beta update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Display-Off Low Power Downloads </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause a delay between finishing downloads and going to sleep if the device had recently received user input.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus a recent Beta for the Desktop Steam Client (Nov 5th):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where PlayStation controller light bar settings did not stick when exiting the controller calibration page.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced or eliminated a bug where the dashboard bar is occasionally missing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And also (Nov 4th):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Xbox 360 controller mappings on newer Linux kernels.</li>
<li>Fixed 8BitDo Pro 3 controller mapping on Linux when hidraw devices aren't available.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse position when using multiple monitors with different display scales.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Terminator 2D: NO FATE delayed yet again into December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terminator 2D: NO FATE has a delay once again with the developers pushing it back into December due to issues with the physical releases. Perhaps this will be the final delay, as they now actually have the physical releases they just need to prepare them all. The issue has been matching up physical and digital release timings which has pushed the release date again.</p>
<p>It's now releasing December 12th as noted in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1718460/view/580528132884267069" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>. You can see the original game overview trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Shoot, sneak and escape the T-1000’s blades in a wide array of levels, and lead the Resistance as John Connor in critical Future War missions.</li>

      <title>The Crew Motorfest is Steam Deck Verified with the Season 8 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/the-crew-motorfest-plans-to-be-steam-deck-verified-for-november-5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft said it would be</a> when they announced it recently, Valve have given The Crew Motorfest the green tick of Steam Deck approval. This new status comes along with the Season 8 update which is now available, after an extended server downtime delay earlier today.</p>
<p>The BattleEye anti-cheat was already enabled as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed on our anti-cheat page</a>, they've just made some improvements to get it up to the green tick. What changes did they make? Your guess is as good as mine, their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/motorfest/news-updates/5EqmmwTrHLUlOTlX5Ya8uP" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> don't actually mention anything to do with it. I sure do love it when developer say they make improvements but don't say what.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/601730971762347913gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve's compatibility notice mentions how it always needs an internet connection. Apart from that, everything else is green ticked. Valve have it set to Proton Experimental by default.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5872943421762348013gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see a bigger publisher like Ubisoft make the effort where many developers still don't, now we just need them to do the same with The Crew 2.</p>

      <title>Scribbly, open-world action adventure Scrabdackle arrives December 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Follow along the misadventure of a novice wizard in Scrabdackle, a scribbly-art open-world action adventure when it arrives on December 2nd. It will arrive with Native Linux support, built with Godot.</p>
<p>What actually is it? From the developer - Scrabdackle is a scribbly, open-world adventure drawing from zeldalike, soulslike, and metroidvania influences. You can explore the world in whatever direction you want, but may be blocked from some pathways until you learn a new spell to help you get by. Or you can just turn around and head somewhere else first instead! Nearly all spells, bosses, and regions of the game can be found in any order.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1578720/view/499459531596628486?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> today their release plan for the first act in Early Access, along with pricing info. Their plan is for it to cost $14.99 for Act 1. They will also be selling the soundtrack for Act 1 with around 40 tracks at $9.99.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QzBF0ZH8qqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cce0c79581b8080e6d92f306b2896fcf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QzBF0ZH8qqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want to try it out early, you'll want to be fast as they've decided the demo will be taken down on November 18th in preparation for the release. It's had a demo for a long time but still a shame to see it go.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Scrabdackle Act 1 features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6 spells to learn.</li>
<li>9 bosses to challenge.</li>
<li>10 regions to explore.</li>
<li>60 unique stickers and stars to find.</li>
<li>90 minutes of music to nod to.</li>
<li>122 notebook entries to scry.</li>
<li>and about 70,000 words to read.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sonic fan game Dr. Robotnik’s Ring Racers gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dr. Robotnik’s Ring Racers is a thoroughly great kart racing game made by fans of the Sonic universe, and a big new upgrade makes it better than ever. <em>While SEGA are busy <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sonic-rumble-has-arrived-on-steam-and-works-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">putting out predatory microtransaction junk</a>, the community delivers.</em></p>
<p>A game made for people who love a challenge, this kart racer is definitely not one you can just instantly pick up and expect to be good in it. You need to master tense combat, resource management, and taking risks under pressure. It's inspired in parts by anti-gravity racers, fighting games and classic kart racers.</p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble has arrived on Steam and works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Rumble from SEGA has arrived on Steam, and although it has anti-cheat it is enabled for Linux / Steam Deck so you're good to go on this one. Valve actually rated it Steam Deck Verified and it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed on our anti-cheat page</a> as it's compatible.</p>
<p>Not that you'll want to play it though. It's a free to play cheap imitation of Fall Guys wearing a Sonic skin, filled to the max with pretty crummy monetization. This looks and feels exactly like a mobile game, complete with the big button overlays in the PC release that you would expect to see on mobile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/402302421762345353gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/402302421762345353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The gameplay isn't even particularly fun. I've played a good bunch of rounds on it this morning to get the feel for it and after a few rounds you've pretty much seen it all, which wouldn't be too bad if it was actually fun but it just feels incredibly shallow. The maps range from a simple race while avoiding obstacles, to running around mashing a button to smash into things to collect the most coins and that's really all there is to it. It is very much Fall Guys Sonic, there's no other way to describe it.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who grew up with Sonic on the Sega Mega Drive, I'm quite disappointed in what they've done to the hedgehog world here. I've no doubt mobile players would get sucked in by it, but this is not the type of experience you would expect to see or even work on PC. The monetization here is just — wow. Expensive. Completely <em>ludicrous</em> even.</p>
<p>Some of the skins cost a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of money. Just look at this one below with Neon Suit Sonic being on sale at 729 down from 999 Red Star Rings. How much is that in <em>real</em> money? Over <strong>£40</strong> just to grab that <em>one</em> single skin. Put your wallets away, it's not worth it. You could buy some of the biggest and best games on Steam for the price of a single skin here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11230890251762344906gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11230890251762344906gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19974143021762344908gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19974143021762344908gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That is the extreme end, so let's be a bit more fair to it because you can also buy a single emote for 99 red rings which is uh, still requiring you to spend about £10 just for that. Okay sure, it can't get <em>worse</em> right? Sure it can! You can spend £5 (minimum) to purchase a Tune-Up bundle to boost your characters in what looks like some pay to win bonus for your points during a round.</p>
<p>Nothing about this looks good. Crappy monetization and boring gameplay. One to skip.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders has seriously exciting gameplay that has firmly hooked me in</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARC Raiders is the new hotness in town and thanks to Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enabling Proton support for Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, I've been putting hour after hour into it.</p>
<p>Since it's an extraction shooter, something that until now I haven't been too familiar with (I've played a little bit elsewhere), adjusting to the gameplay has been thoroughly interesting. Being a Linux gamer, our options for such games are <em>incredibly</em> <em>limited</em>. Actually, this might be the only game of its class that's properly playable on Linux. Not only that, but ARC Raiders is strangely welcoming even with the often brutal challenge to it.</p>
<p>If I had any hair left on my head, it would have at times make me pull it out from the stress of it. ARC Raiders makes me question my sanity as much as it <em>excites</em> me. The minute-to-minute gameplay is some of the most interesting I've seen in forever in an online action game. <em>Helldivers 2 comes pretty close to it though.</em></p>
<p>You just don't know what's going to happen from one minute to the next. Will you find a friendly player? Will someone gun you down and take all your loot? Will you decide to backstab someone that didn't want a fight? There is simply no wrong way to play it - it's all about those split-second decisions that will decide if you live or die. It is a PvPvE game, so you make the choice on how you play it and what you're going to do during each run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9747868371762263260gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9747868371762263260gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Those are some big robots in the distance…</em></p>
<p>Also helped by the fact that it's a gorgeous looking game. It's certainly not the best-ever looking, but we've hit a point where most AA/AAA games are just good enough that I don't think we need to keep chasing realism and ARC Raiders makes that clear. It also performs pretty darn well overall too. I'm constantly taking screenshots thinking - "wow, that looks so cool!".</p>
<p>I'm only really scratching the surface in my surprising amount of hours in it, but even so, I've experienced so many different events that constantly leave me just wanting more. The combat is simply wonderful in it, especially with the ARC robot design and the excellent physics that go along with them. Like the simple ARC hover drones for example, one of the most basic PvE enemies you'll face. As you shoot out their individual propellers and they lose control, they often go speeding off into a wall or the floor and explode. <em>It's actually a little funny when it happens.</em></p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6897082961762342191gol1.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p>It's nice that the gameplay isn't just a constant firefight. You do need to be quite sneaky. ARC, and other players, will be attracted by noise. Make too much noise, ARC will come over to investigate and potentially fill you with holes. Or, another player may come sneaking up behind you to say hello. Some types of ARC will also call in backup if you don't take them out quick enough, which can end up a big problem for you.</p>
<p>So many things going on during a game too, each map is pretty dynamic. Not just through time of day and weather systems, but all the mini-events and the ARC NPCs too. Like the ARC Probes that fly down, which have some nice loot in them. It's a rush to get to them, and they're incredibly noisy and attract attention. But sometimes you might find one landing right next to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19643080701762264467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19643080701762264467gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11093441762264470gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11093441762264470gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There was a time our party of three came across another player screaming at us not to shoot, turns out once they calmed down they were rather softly spoken. To thank us for not shooting, they took us on a little trip where they found some good loot. What happened next was rough though. A big rocket drone none of us spotted came to say hello, and promptly ended their run with a big boom. Oh dear.</p>
<p>My enjoyment of it is helped by the PvE and PvP being so clearly distinct. People are always players, the robots are always the ARC NPCs AI. There's no confusion there at all. You know what you're potentially getting into as soon as you see. Not that it really helps you, since anything can still happen.</p>
<p>A run we had last night was pretty epic too. There was an event going on where some top loot was at the top of a very tall tower. So everyone was fighting for it against all other groups, and against all the ARC NPCs flying around it. After a while, and some sneaking, we managed as a duo to get near the top, but came up against fire from a trio. By sheer luck, we defeated all three of them and managed to loot their bodies as well as score some really great weapons. Unfortunately for us, a couple of drones were circling outside due to all the noise and promptly ended our run by firing into the building. It was incredibly tense, and even though we didn't come out with anything it was so fun that didn't matter.</p>
<p>Also, screw this thing in particular:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875065511762340429gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875065511762340429gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Finishing a round by extracting is also a heart-pumping rush every single time without fail. Because you just know <em>something</em> is likely to happen. I've saved people as much as I've decided to be <em>completely evil</em>. Like the time I went to extract and saw an ARC drone hovering over a bus, shooting constantly at it. I realised someone was inside, so I took out the drone. A player came running out thanking the heck out of me over voice comms. It genuinely made me feel really good. Or the time someone else was about to extract, and I liked the look of their gun and so…well, I put a hole in the back of their head. Don't judge me, it's a tough world out there.</p>
<p>Or how about you go to extract, look around and think you're safe so you run in and tap on the computer to leave only to turn around and suddenly there's two other players just staring at you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5791129531762263759gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5791129531762263759gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Where the hell did those two ninjas come from?</em></p>
<p>Being a PvPvE game, it's not just other players lurking around the extraction zones you need to worry about. It's also all the different ARC NPC enemies that can quite easily ruin your run. The various types of drones flying around, some with weapons that can stun you, others that will explode you and make a misery of your day. And then there's this thing that roams around…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19172301821762264066gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19172301821762264066gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10905850881762264067gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10905850881762264067gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The leaper pictured above is an absolute menace. Quite difficult to take down due to the armour plating, but also an incredibly fun fight.</p>
<p>While it can be overly frustrating to lose everything at times, the loop is what keeps me coming back for more. Okay, so I lost everything, but if I always go in with a plan on each run - it doesn't seem so bad. Like gathering one specific resource, taking in some cheap gear and then coming back to deal with all the crafting and upgrades, to potentially do another run with some better gear.</p>
<p>The crafting system can be a bit confusing though, you don't always know what you're going to need, and their item descriptions on some items intentionally don't tell you that you might actually need them. It's all about figuring it out for yourself, or spoiling it all with a guide (not me though, I like figuring it out). At least loot is colour-coded though, so you know if something is good at least with grey being common, green being uncommon, blue being rare, purple is epic and yellow is legendary.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18594145721762342493gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18594145721762342493gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it's true it's an accessible game in terms of extraction shooters, there's so many parts that are just plain difficult and frustrating. So I've decided to note down a few tips for you beginner raiders to hopefully help you along the way just a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Play entirely solo until you properly understand the game. ARC Raiders matches solo players to solo players (at least usually), and groups of 2-3 with groups. Solo play is far far easier, and usually just a much better time when you're starting off.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Use the free loadout option, constantly. Especially early-on in the game, it's just stupid not to. When you're readying up for a game, you can pick it at the top instead of your normal loadout. This will give you a randomised set of starter equipment, which is great when you're having a breezy run through to grab a few items. Allowing you a bit more chance of survival rather than going in naked, without the <em>stress</em> of losing your good gear. And, as a bonus, when you've extracted, you can swap the beginner pack for something better at a trader completely <em>free</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1942131141762264753gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1942131141762264753gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Don't forget your safe pocket! Did you just find something cool or valuable? Stick it straight in, and you'll keep it even if you die. However, the free loadout doesn't have a safe pocket. <em>Just don't ask where the safe pocket is, I don't want to know either.</em></p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Adrenaline Shots are your friends. They can mean the difference between you outrunning ARC or a player and dying with all your goodies on you.</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong>Put all of your starter level up points into Stamina. Like with 4, they can be the difference between life and a frustrating end.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18001668951762341210gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18001668951762341210gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Holster your weapon so you run faster.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Even if you're downed, you can still pull the extraction lever and exit the level.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> Don't run into an extraction zone as soon as it's available after calling it. Players may be watching and shoot you as you run in. Extraction zones have a 2 minute timer before they close automatically. You have time to scout for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>9) </strong>Arc Powercells can be used to power up your shield if you don't have a Shield Recharger.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> You can get free items via the Raider Deck, and by doing Quests. Quests especially can be worth actually going through properly.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of those little tips will help you survive a bit longer.</p>
<p>What's next for it? A lot. It's live-service so it's going to be sprinkling in content constantly and their roadmap for it has me quite excited with new events, new maps, new map conditions and lots more to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2189586821762262639gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2189586821762262639gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There are some things I really don't like about it though. Like the cost of the in-game purchases for a paid game, the pricing is a bit overly ridiculous in some cases. They need to bring the prices down. I'm also still feeling a bit off about their use of AI for the text-to-speech voices (used in voice barks, like pointing out items). While it's certainly a lot more ethical than a lot of generative AI use, since they actually hired actors and have their full permission, it still feels a bit weird. It leaves me conflicted because I enjoy it so much.</p>
<p>For the gameplay though, it's just amazing. So dynamic you never know what's going to happen, it truly has its hooks into me and I cannot stop playing. I don't know how things will go once I've put many tens more hours into it and perhaps even hundreds, but right now I cannot think of anything that will make me stop playing it apart from any anti-cheat woes for Linux. All will rest on how the game evolves with the updates planned and if the community sticks around to keep it alive where many other games have failed.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a new low-power screen-off downloads mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably the single most requested Steam Deck feature since release is now in Beta, allowing you to get your downloads going with the screen off. You need to opt-in to access this to test it before it rolls out to everyone via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>Trying the feature is pretty simple. When you go to put the Steam Deck to sleep, it will ask you what you want to do between continue downloading or go right to sleep. Otherwise, the Steam Deck will automatically enter this mode after an idle timeout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3114011671762295388gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3114011671762295388gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>When the Steam Deck is in this special mode if you press a button or move a stick a new status screen will appear to show download progress. If you're on battery power, it will automatically go into the normal sleep mode when the battery level falls below 20%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2333742871762295389gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2333742871762295389gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>This feature comes along with the new settings for it available in the Power menu, with display-off downloads on battery power disabled by default. But you can easily turn it on if you want it. Mainly, this is good for when you're plugged in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3669094311762295445gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3669094311762295445gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Available in the Beta / Preview channel here's the main <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267921" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> for the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Display-Off Low Power Downloads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new feature, allowing Steam Deck to complete all active downloads in a new display-off low-power mode before going to sleep.</li>
<li>This feature is enabled by default when Steam Deck is plugged in to power, and can also be enabled on battery power in Settings &gt; Power.</li>
<li>Learn more about this feature at our blog post <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed SteamOS updates failing to respect HTTP proxy configuration.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression where the performance graph wouldn't display while streaming.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really amazing to see this feature land. Valve just keep on delivering for the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>HYPER DEMON PVP brings a free 1v1 FPS like no other out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the developer of Devil Daggers and HYPER DEMON comes HYPER DEMON PVP, taking the wild visual style to a competitive 1v1 online FPS. Best of all - it's free, and it looks absolutely nuts. </p>
<p>Originally, it was actually a secret Easter egg in HYPER DEMON but they decided to expand upon the idea and just release it for everyone to jump in and blast someone. Not that I have even the tiniest idea what's going on, because it really is visually nuts.</p>
<p>Here you have to truly master movement and precise aiming, while always being on the move. Keep damaging an opponent to grow their weak point, which you can use to eventually defeat them. Beat them 3 times and you win the match and compete on a global leaderboard. You can also make private games to play friends, watch replays of others and play CPU AI players to practice too.</p>

      <title>Warhammer Survivors announced as a licensed Vampire Survivors game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh wow, that's certainly a surprise. Warhammer Survivors is coming from Auroch Digital as a licensed version of Vampire Survivors. I've joked a number of times about how every developer seems to be trying to make a survivor-like, but this really moves things a step further taking the original Vampire Survivors and putting an official Warhammer theme on top of it.</p>
<p>We've seen Vampire Survivors do multiple themed DLC, but it seems Games Workshop must have wanted a bigger slice of the survivor pie with a standalone game instead. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Endorsed as part of the official Survivors lineage, this standalone game brings familiar tides of endless enemies with fresh twists, iconic characters, and powerful weapons, packaged in an entirely new setting. Or should we say, settings!  </p>
<p>Choosing from the Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Age of Sigmar universes, players will lead a roster of iconic characters and endure against the swarms of relentless enemies. Weapons and power-ups can be combined into devastating new forms to create screen-clearing storms of bullets, blades and magic.    </p>
<p>Experiment in every run with new strategies, unlocking new characters, upgrades, weapon combinations, as well as troves of secrets and collectables waiting to be discovered. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P5E_EaxN1qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06aeface93635baa969eb905f2007e4e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Not everything about it has been revealed yet. Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast and frantic Survivors gameplay.  </li>
<li>A roster of iconic characters from the Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar universes, featuring Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun’s very own Malum Caedo!  </li>
<li>Multiple modes and stages from across the grimdark 41st Millennium and the Mortal Realms.  </li>
<li>An arsenal of familiar weapons, such as the Boltgun, Astartes Chainsword, Whirlwind Axes, and ​​glorious​ easter eggs such as ​the humble pot of Citadel Nuln Oil paint.  </li>
<li>A mighty cache of passives and power-ups to aid in enduring against the monstrous legions.  </li>
<li>Esoteric secrets and easter eggs to uncover and collectables to collect!  </li>
<li>...and much more still to be announced! </li>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 580.105.08 out now for Linux as the new recommended version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released the latest recommended / certified stable driver for Linux with version 580.105.08.</p>
<p>What is a recommended driver according to NVIDIA? As they said: "This driver meets the quality levels applied to Windows drivers that pass testing in Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), therefore providing the same attention to driver reliability, robustness, and performance for non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux)."</p>
<p>All the changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added a new environment variable, CUDA_DISABLE_PERF_BOOST, to allow for disabling the default behavior of boosting the GPU to a higher power state when running CUDA applications. Setting this environment variable to '1' will disable the boost.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the vfio-pci module to soft lockup after powering off a VM with passed-through NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a recent regression which prevented HDMI FRL from working after hot unplugging and replugging a display.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some HDMI displays to remain blank after unplugging and re-plugging the display.</li>

      <title>Valve upgrade Proton Hotfix to improve NINJA GAIDEN 4 on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While NINJA GAIDEN 4 is Steam Deck Verified, it turns out on Desktop Linux it has some big problems that Valve have hopefully solved now.</p>
<p>Announcing it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3m4rlsggx7s25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned "A Proton Hotfix has been deployed for the NINJA GAIDEN 4 hang issue on desktop". Looking on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/9120" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> report, seems many people were seeing the game constantly freeze. Valve have now set it by default for the game.</p>
<p>Proton Hotfix is the extra special version of Proton that gets very sporadic updates, specifically when a game needs them so you shouldn't really touch it unless you need to. More about all the Proton versions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the GamingOnLinux Guide</a>.</p>

      <title>The original Pillars of Eternity is getting a turn-based mode Beta on November 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A chance to experience this classic RPG in a new way, with a turn-based mode coming to the original Pillars of Eternity on November 5th in Beta. The date and a new trailer was revealed today by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>
<p>The second game already has it, and so they're bringing it over to the first game but with some improvements based on previous feedback that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unbound Turns: All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li>
<li>Smarter Free Actions: Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li>
<li>Faster Pacing: Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li>
<li>Mode Flexibility: You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer with a message from Josh Sawyer, the Game Director:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Mj6HObhD_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76fa00645ec3b8e976105b28f53a5a67.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a Beta it may have some bugs, and they'll be working through feedback towards a full release of it.</p>
<p>This sounds excellent, and will probably allow me to enjoy the game a whole lot more.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds graphics improvements and more planet customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving evolution a little bit more visual flair, Thrive is a scientific open source sim about surviving and growing as a tiny creature. A new release has arrived bringing with it some pretty big changes to how it looks, along with even more customization of your run.</p>
<p>What is it? You take control of an organism on an alien planet, starting off in the microbe stage. The game world and other creatures all evolve and change as you do. It's all quite science-focused too, although not too overloading. <em>It's seriously cool.</em></p>
<p>In the v0.9.0 update out now they've added in procedural terrain to make the world look a bit more alive, with a greater variety of minerals appearing in future updates that are planned. Various other graphical improvements have been added to the game to improve the atmosphere too like more particle effects for currents, the point was to make it all feel more like "a drop of water in a ginormous ocean as opposed to just being an extremely flat environment".</p>
<p>Tons more is in this one like a new save system, more planet customization, an upgrade to Godot 4.5, an upgraded physics engine and lots more.</p>

<p>It's still free and open source but you can buy it from stores to support the development. It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>

      <title>Anti-grav racer BallisticNG brings new tracks, enhanced online play and more for the final update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The last major update for the Wipeout-like anti-grav racer BallisticNG is here, bringing with it new content and enhancements to existing features. The developers have said they're moving on from the game, as development on it will be sunset as they look to their next project. We'll still see some smaller updates and some paid DLC, but this is now the last major update for the racing game.</p>
<p>With the update there's two new tracks, and a whole lot of upgrades for online play including a new rollback netcode implementation. Multiplayer was expanded too with new game mode support, random ship variants for bots, and just online play that should work a whole lot better.</p>
<p>Input improvements too with more customisation of hotkeys and improvements to controller support, improvements to modding support and there's loads more - it's a long <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/473770/view/547870056202109268" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>The Siege Update for Dwarf Fortress has arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress has levelled up with the big Siege Update out now bringing with it a whole lot of trouble, which should spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>You're not safe in the mountain anymore. Enemies will find new ways to invade by digging, building bridges and overcoming other things like water and lava to get at you. They'll also have new weapons, but you've got some new defensive tricks too. The good news is you shouldn't need to start over for it! However, if you prefer things a bit more peaceful a bunch of it can be turned off too. Sounds like some nice additions to an already deep game.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="67qFzcLv8lQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2875b3a7d1c3bd85c67fadd28fbddbdc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/67qFzcLv8lQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Siege update - Attack</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invaders can build stairs and floors.</li>
<li>Invaders can break down constructions and many blocking buildings</li>
<li>Invaders can bring battering rams to bash through constructions and buildings.</li>

<li>Invaders can be lead by historical military-related position holders.</li>
<li>Invaders track where deaths and trap incidents have occurred and eventually plan to avoid them.</li>

<li>Invaders enter over a wider edge width.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Siege update - Defence</strong>
<ul>
<li>New bolt thrower siege engine. These fire regular bolts and can be freely rotated to any direction if an operator can stand behind it.</li>
<li>Catapult and ballista siege engines are placed with fixed firing arcs but can target in the full arc rather than firing only in cardinal directions, and they can fire vertically somewhat.</li>
<li>Boulders thrown by catapults explode on impact, ejecting sharp rock shards.</li>

      <title>Nexus Mods app improves file conflict management ready for Fallout 4 and Skyrim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer cross-platform Nexus Mods app is getting a lot closer to supporting games like Fallout 4 and Skyrim, with version <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.20.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">0.20.2</a> out now for testing.</p>
<p>Currently the app only has full support for Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk, with work ongoing towards Baldur's Gate 3, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, Skyrim and Fallout 4. They're building it up carefully, ensuring they have the features needed to future-proof it, and with Linux support it's going to be awesome for modders.</p>
<p>In this release they noted: "File conflicts—a common occurrence in modding games like Skyrim and Fallout 4—happen when multiple mods try to install different versions of the same file. With this release, we've added a new priority-based system that allows you to see and easily edit file conflict winners and losers using intuitive Drag &amp; Drop controls. This gives you visual control over which mods and files take priority".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/464434511762180374gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/464434511762180374gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They've also added more context menus, fixed a corruption issue with downloads, fixed SMAPI (Stardew Valley) on Linux and fixed an exception that occurred when trying to open the logs folder from the App help menu.</p>

      <title>The Crew Motorfest plans to be Steam Deck Verified for November 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubisoft have confirmed that The Crew Motorfest will be bumped up to Steam Deck Verified with the arrival of Season 8 on November 5th.</p>
<p>Currently, Valve have it rated as Steam Deck Unsupported but Valve's rating for it is a little bit outdated. The game does already work, even with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the BattleEye anti-cheat</a> that it has and especially with a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-experimental-updated-with-fixes-for-the-crew-motorfest-farlight-84-and-more-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Proton Experimental update</a> that improved it further.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6519608641762179068gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Crew Motorfest</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/news/ignt.55791/season-8-quality-of-life-improvements" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the Ubisoft website the developers noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Get ready to join the Motorfest with no strings (or wires) attached, because The Crew Motorfest will be Steam Deck verified on November 5!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't go into detail on what exact improvements they're making.</p>
<p>A major new feature will be coming to the next season with the Friend Pass. This allows anyone with a full copy of the game to invite up to three friends with a trial version without any time limits. Pretty nice.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, they haven't yet enabled the anti-cheat with The Crew 2, which recently gained a hybrid offline mode. Since they've done it for The Crew Motorfest, hopefully The Crew 2 isn't too far behind on that.</p>

      <title>Chizha Mount Ling Dock for Steam Deck looks premium and it&#39;s fully featured but pricey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on the Dockcase: Chizha Mount Ling Dock for Steam Deck sent over a review sample, so I've been testing it for weeks and here's what I think.</p>
<p>What you get is a very premium device, with a price tag to go with it. My thought is that it's definitely a niche device, even in the world of Steam Deck docks but is it actually worth it? That's what I aimed to find out. Which is why I took quite a while to come to a decision on this one, since I've tested quite a number of docks over the years now from cheap to expensive and all sorts in between. The good news is — it works great! Plug and play with everything, not a single issue encountered with it. <em>Only bit not tested is the optical audio, since I simply don't have anything that needs it</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6917570731762167211gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The Dockcase: Chizha Mount Ling Dock for Steam Deck provides a very solid base with a lot of space between the back rest and the front, which allows you to angle the Steam Deck a bit (and provide room for bigger handhelds too). This ensures the Steam Deck gets plenty of breathing room, which certain other docks really do lack for the intake.</p>
<p>There's an M.2 SSD slot that supports 2230, 2242 and 2280 for you to bump up the storage of your Steam Deck (great for lots of games!), although a little fiddly to open since it needs a tiny screwdriver but one <em>is</em> supplied with it. There's even a built-in fan to keep the SSD nice and cool which is quite a nice touch.</p>
<p>Along with that, they also provide a separate SSD enclosure you can use via USB-C for even more storage, but one was not supplied for testing so I cannot comment on how well it works.</p>
<p>You have a screen in the middle for you to adjust all sorts of settings, along with fancy (but colour limited) lights on each side. Settings like adjusting the fan, the lights, check over the SSD status, HDMI status, USB port status, volume, Ethernet info and power supply status and info. I actually <em>haven't</em> needed to use the screen, as all the default settings work fine.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For ports you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dedicated USB-C for connection to the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>USB-C for 100W max power delivery, and an extra USB 3.2 type-C 10Gbps port next to it.</li>
<li>1 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 10Gbps + 1 x USB 2.0.</li>
<li>HDMI 2.0 4K at 60Hz.</li>
<li>Optical audio.</li>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
</ul>
<p>You also get a <em>detachable</em> cable for connection to the Steam Deck, which is great. That's one thing I wished all docks had instead of the breakable built-in cable. However, that is an extra. There's also no charger, so you have to bring your own and if you want to power it fully and properly including an SSD, you'll likely need more than what comes with the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>My main issue with the dock is that I find it all very distracting. If I'm docking my Steam Deck, I don't want a bright screen and lights staring at me. Thankfully, they thought of this too, as there's a button on the back to one-click turn them both off or on again. Excellent.</p>
<p>When it comes to firmware updates, I spoke with their team who provided a Windows-only tool which I just couldn't get working as they've slightly adjusted the brightness but no matter what it wouldn't detect the device. They told me they're working on a Linux tool for that but it's not ready yet and the retail units will be upgraded already. That is the only single issue I've had with it, and may just be because it's an early unit, or Windows 11 being dumb.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm torn. It's a dock that does look good, it feels absolutely solid - you're not going to break this unless you <em>really</em> try to and it has some nice specifications. It's impressive that's for sure.</p>
<p>But, the price and all the extra features really limit who even needs it or will even want it. Options are great, it is a nice device and the extra features pretty much future-proof it for perhaps even the Steam Deck 2. The problem really is just the price, at $199 you can find a lot of docks with enough ports for far less. You can get it cheaper as the Kickstarter has it for less at an Early Bird price at $129 for the dock and USB cable together.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dockcaseexplorerepro/chizha-mount-ling-dock-where-legends-ascend/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">find it on Kickstarter</a> which ends November 20th.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-25 brings fixes for Nioh 2, WoW, Rockstar Launcher and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another smaller bug fix release arrived with GE-Proton 10-25 to run more Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Here's all you need to know.</p>
<p>We've had quite a few releases of it recently, as issues keep being found.

I continue to advise people to simply use Valve's official Proton, unless GE-Proton has something specific you <em>need</em>. But, options are great!</p>

      <title>Wine 10.18 brings OpenGL memory mapping using Vulkan in WoW64 mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing many improvements to running Windows apps and games on Linux, Wine version 10.18 has arrived as we close in on the Wine 11 release.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>OpenGL memory mapping using Vulkan in WoW64 mode.</li>
<li>Synchronization barriers API.</li>
<li>Support for WinRT exceptions.</li>
<li>SCSI pass-through in WoW64 mode.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the WoW64 mode improvements, we should hopefully see more games now run better in the pure 64-bit Wine builds. Looking over the bug fixes there's issues solved for the likes of a Yukon Trail bug report from 2007, Sid Meier's Pirates!, C&amp;C Generals Zero Hour, Autodesk Fusion, Keepass 2, Nightshade, Jolly Rover, The Witcher 2, MDK 2,  PlayOnline Viewer (FINAL FANTASY XI) and more.</p>

      <title>Linux gamers on Steam finally cross over the 3% mark</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It finally happened. Linux gamers on Steam as of the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for October 2025 have crossed over the elusive 3% mark. The trend has been clear for sometime, and with Windows 10 ending support, it was quite likely this was going to be the time for it to happen as more people try out Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As of the October 2025 survey the operating system details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 94.84% -0.75%</li>
<li>Linux 3.05% +0.41%</li>
<li>macOS 2.11% +0.34%</li>
</ul>
<p>The snapshot chart from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> shows the clear trend:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1139496631762087838gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1139496631762087838gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall, 3% might not seem like much to some, but again - that trend is very clear and equates to millions of people. The last time Valve officially gave a proper monthly active user count was in 2022, and we know Steam has grown a lot since then, but even going by that original number would put monthly active Linux users at well over 4 million. Sadly, Valve have not given out a more recent monthly active user number but it's likely a few million higher, especially with the Steam Deck selling millions.</p>
<p>And if we look at the distribution breakdown chart from our page:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21445529501762087839gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21445529501762087839gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The overall distribution numbers for October 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SteamOS Holo 64 bit</strong> - 27.18% (-0.47%)</li>
<li><strong>Arch Linux 64 bit</strong> - 10.32% (-0.66%)</li>
<li><strong>Linux Mint 22.2 64 bit</strong> - 6.65% (+6.65%)</li>
<li><strong>CachyOS 64 bit</strong> - 6.01% (+1.32%)</li>
<li><strong>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit</strong> - 4.55% (+0.55%)</li>
<li><strong>Freedesktop SDK 25.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit</strong> - 4.29% (+4.29%)</li>
<li><strong>Bazzite 64 bit</strong> - 4.24% (+4.24%)</li>
<li><strong>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 64 bit</strong> - 3.70% (+3.70%)</li>
<li><strong>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit</strong> - 2.56% (-5.65%)</li>
<li><strong>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit</strong> - 2.32% (-0.08%)</li>
<li><strong>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit</strong> - 2.31% (-3.98%)</li>
<li><strong>Fedora Linux 42 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition) 64 bit</strong> - 2.12% (+0.19%)</li>
<li><strong>Manjaro Linux 64 bit</strong> - 2.04% (-0.31%)</li>
<li><strong>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit</strong> - 1.93% (-0.04%)</li>
<li><strong>Fedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition) 64 bit</strong> - 1.75% (-0.43%)</li>
<li><strong>Other</strong> - 18.04% (-4.28%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers are still being massively pumped up by the Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux, which is not surprising considering that the Steam Deck is still in the top 10 of the global top sellers on Steam constantly. And with all the rumours and leaks surrounding the upcoming Steam Frame, which will hopefully be a SteamOS Linux powered VR kit, we could see the numbers just continue to jump higher.</p>

      <title>The classic Serious Sam 2 gets a big upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A blast from the past returns in style, with Serious Sam 2 from Croteam recently getting a huge 20th Annviersary Update and now it has been Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the update rolled out October 11th and Part 2 on October 27th. Across the updates the developer added in a load of Steam community items, they bundled the huge Renovation Mod mod into the game, gave it a big UI upgrade, improved controller support, lots of bug fixes and…it's quite a long list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5352701931761920828gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thanks to all the upgrades to the UI, defaults and controller support it is also now Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible for you to take on the go. And, means it should work great with Proton on Desktop Linux PCs too. Valve bumped up the default to run on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/proton-10-0-3-release-candidate-live-for-testing-better-windows-game-compatibility-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Proton 10</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see more classic games get upgraded to work well on modern systems.</p>

      <title>Linux users have no reason to worry about recent AMD GPU driver changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a little PSA to Linux users and Linux gamers, with news reports out there about AMD shifting focus away from certain GPUs.</p>
<p>What's happening? People noticed in the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 release notes</a> how it says "New Game Support and Expanded Vulkan Extensions Support is available to Radeon™ RX 7000 and 9000 series graphics products" signaling a shift away from earlier generations like the popular Radeon RX 5000 and RX 6000 series. According to <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/news/grafikkarten/fsr-4-auf-rdna-2-vom-tisch-amd-versetzt-radeon-rx-5000-und-6000-in-den-vorruhestand.94862/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">computerbase.de</a>, they've had confirmation from AMD that the RX 5000 and RX 6000 series are indeed going into "maintenance mode".</p>
<p>The thing is - this only concerns the <em>Windows</em> driver.</p>
<p>Linux uses a very different driver system with the open source Mesa project that contains many drivers, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/amdvlk-has-been-discontinued-as-amd-are-throwing-their-full-support-behind-radv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AMD recently discontinued their AMDVLK</a> to give their full support for Mesa's RADV. So, you don't need to worry about it if you're on Linux, as we've seen from updates to Mesa for some pretty old GPUs at times. And, with Mesa drivers being open source, anyone can pick up the torch anytime if an older driver stops being updated by the existing maintainers. Something that's not the case with closed-source drivers.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course we have Valve with SteamOS Linux with the Steam Deck using an AMD APU - it's not like Valve are going to stop all the driver upgrades any time soon either which benefits all Linux users.</p>
<p>Anyway, the recent news is nothing to worry about for Linux gamers.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Advance Wars, the new Earth vs Mars from Relic Entertainment is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A smaller team at Relic Entertainment under the Relic Labs umbrella have released Earth vs Mars, a homage to some classic strategy games like Advance Wars.</p>
<p>Quite a break from the likes of Company of Heroes / Dawn of War. Relic said their smaller teams with Relic Labs are experimenting with smaller games to get them into your hands sooner. Not really surprising, spending many years building up single games simply isn't sustainable for a lot of developers.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">This love letter to the turn-based strategy genre puts players at the helm of Earth’s forces in a desperate battle against a full-scale Martian invasion. Players must lead an unlikely group of commanders against alien saucers, grav-tanks, and elite alien warriors threatening the planet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Humanity’s secret weapon is the <em>Splice-O-Tron</em>, a device that fuses human volunteers with Earth’s creatures to create powerful hybrid super soldiers. From cheetah-fly scouts to rhino-human tanks and squirrel-cow infantry, these bizarre, but powerful, super soldiers give humanity a fighting chance. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As the campaign unfolds, you’ll unlock new creatures, upgrades, and commander abilities—but your enemy evolves too, unleashing horrors like “The Creep” and other mutant creations.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><strong>Online Multiplayer –</strong> Battle against other commanders in 1vs1 multiplayer, either as the armies of Earth or as the forces of the Martian Invaders</li>

      <title>ARK: Survival Ascended gets bumped up to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARK: Survival Ascended entered Early Access in 2023, and while it worked well enough on Linux / Steam Deck - Valve noted it was Unsupported until now.</p>
<p>What is it? ARK: Survival Ascended is a remake of the original ARK: Survival Evolved with Unreal Engine 5. Form a tribe, tame &amp; breed hundreds of unique dinosaurs and primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2389526161761910115gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Not long after the initial release, Valve checked it over and gave it a Steam Deck Unsupported rating noting the anti-cheat was <em>not</em> supported. The game uses BattlEye, even though it's <em>not</em> actually listed on the Steam store page (so they seem to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">breaking Valve's own rules on that</a>). It's not entirely clear when BattlEye was actually enabled for Linux / SteamOS but it has been working for a while now and is listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>As of October 30th, Valve finally re-tested it and gave it the green Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible tick. They've also now by default set it to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/proton-10-0-3-release-candidate-live-for-testing-better-windows-game-compatibility-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Proton 10</a>.</p>

      <title>The classic tense horror roguelike &#39;Basingstoke&#39; from Puppygames gets a big surprise upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Basingstoke (now known as Welcome to Basingstoke) is an absolute underappreciated gem from Puppygames, and now is the perfect time to jump back in. It somewhat recently had a console release, and so the developers have refreshed the PC version with a whole bunch of upgrades so perhaps it's time to give this classic a new life.</p>
<p>What is it? If you've not heard of it before - it's a tense roguelike from 2018 that mixes stealth and arcade action. You get to explore the smouldering ruins of apocalyptic Basingstoke, UK, a world of extreme peril where reanimated undead and ferocious alien monsters roam. It really is an <em>incredibly</em> tense game, and one that Puppygames previously said <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/as-puppygames-reflect-on-the-release-of-basingstoke-they-say-it-financially-ruined-them/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financially ruined them</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16730708951761907968gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/336940/view/547875764461113018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new update</a> announced adds in a big remake of the later stages of the game, along with a special new end level that actually allows you to escape with 10 completely new areas and nearly 300 new scenery items. All that plus what's in the list below (and many bug fixes) add up to an awesome sounding upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Achievements for the new levels, Horde mode... and a new extra special secret one :)</li>
<li>Added three new special Omnicorp items</li>
<li>Replaced the old Horde mode UI and added special skins for the Horde mode characters</li>
<li>Enemies would block the player hurdling if on the other side of a barrier - now the player knocks them back instead, and ninja kicks them if timed right</li>
<li>Added UI scaling option</li>
<li>Added controller shake support, and sliders for controller and camera shake</li>
<li>Added audio recording to instant replay, and options for resolution, framerate etc. (Windows only)</li>
<li>Added quick zoom control that works in the game and the map</li>
<li>Added controls to the map to find the level start, player and exit</li>
<li>Changed the map so undiscovered areas are shown as flat black rather than hidden</li>
<li>Added various tweaks to enemy spawning and behaviour based on difficulty autotuning</li>
<li>Added FRAGILE warning to melee weapons if near breaking</li>
<li>Added option to view item info in the shop and vending machines</li>
<li>Changed popup help controls – show map, show next help, or close help, depending on context</li>
<li>Added enemy models to enemy info in the encyclopedia</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent trailer to show it off (for the console release) is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwyuY-xsAZ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/889321f097a1179469c284c1efada3a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwyuY-xsAZ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a Linux version and it's rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Do give this one a go.</p>

      <title>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake out now and Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have released DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake and you should be mostly good to go on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck with it.</p>
<p>Valve have stuck it with a Playable Steam Deck rating and it's SteamOS Compatible. The main issues noted being small text, plus it requires an internet connection for the first run and it doesn't default to external controllers - so you may need to use the SteamOS Quick Access menu to change the active controller.</p>
<p>Apart from that, you should be fine as everything else works with the testing being done on Proton 10.</p>
<p>Release trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Cle07k1-TWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a055ed4911cd4114853460bc4234675.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Cle07k1-TWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake combines full remakes of DRAGON QUEST I and DRAGON QUEST II, which chronologically take place after DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake which launched in November 2024. You will get to experience the conclusion to the Erdrick Trilogy in these two standalone epic adventures, with the upgraded HD-2D graphical style with never-before-seen story content and gameplay updates that includes a new, fully explorable underwater world and playable character in DRAGON QUEST II, among many other additions.</p>

      <title>Replicat is basically the classic card game snap meets Balatro - check out the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Balatro, much like Vampire Survivors, has created a bit of an indie trend and now the classic card game snap has been given the Balatro treatment in Replicat.</p>
<p>There's a demo available, built with Unity it has Native Linux support with a release currently planned for November 19th. I've given the demo a run through and think they genuinely have a great idea here. The classic card-matching memory game, but tweaked for modern generations to add a little more flavour. Since it's now a roguelike deck-builder, you get to acquire all sorts of special cards to bend and break the game resulting in some crazy combos.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14246509831761832748gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14246509831761832748gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Much like the inspiration, you go through rounds to build up a score and you need to keep hitting a higher score to continue on. Here it's definitely challenging, especially because my short-term memory is apparently awful. During your run you earn money to spend on new cards in the shop to add to your deck like cards that give you bonus moves or matching any other card. You also get to buy up special curios which allow you to tweak your whole run with bonuses like multiplying your score or money.</p>
<p>With all the ways you can change your run, it's not entirely a memory game like snap. Since you can acquire tools to reveal extra cards, keep them flipped so you can see them instead of them flipping back when you mismatch and even ways to force mismatches to work. There's a lot of ways to mess with it in your favour. Some cards will also auto-reveal their match, if you're lucky enough to pick them.</p>

<p>My only concern is time. There's so many games releasing, this might suck a lot away from me because the demo is quite delicious.</p>

      <title>The brutal survival horror Darkwood is getting a sequel with Darkwood 2 from Hooded Horse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Publisher Hooded Horse recently revealed Darkwood 2 is coming from the developers of the Pathologic series. It's being made in consultation with the original Darkwood developers Acid Wizard. No release date has been set for it yet.</p>
<p>Need a refresher first? Darkwood originally released in 2017, and went onto receive an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from players on Steam (over 20,000 users rating it). It's a dark and spooky top-down mixture of exploration, action, survival and horror. Darkwood 2 is set years following the first game but it's completely standalone, so you don't need to have played the first game. With a new story, new lands to explore, new horrifying creatures to evade and it looks just as terrifying.</p>
<p>The first trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CR99LP_nays"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/74583aacebafdedf89aa418e3d04b855.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CR99LP_nays" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"The original Darkwood is a unique experience in horror -- mixing resource management and strategic survival into a rarely used top-down horror format," says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. "We’re honored to be part of the sequel, and to be working with such a great team."</p>
<p>"Crafting the world of Darkwood was a very challenging and long journey for the team," says Acid Wizard co-founder Gustaw Stachaszewski. "After an experience like that, you become emotionally attached to your work. We know that the fans have been eagerly awaiting a continuation of Darkwood. For years, the idea of handing over our baby to another studio was something unthinkable for us. But, after it became evident that working together is not viable anymore, we decided that Darkwood should live on, even if not directly through our work."</p>
<p>"We're genuinely excited to pass on the torch to Ice-Pick Lodge - creators whose work on Pathologic has inspired us for years. The team at IPL really gets what makes Darkwood a unique experience. We believe they will not only honor its spirit but will create something truly exceptional. As for us, we'll be in the background, making sure it stays true to the original vision."</p>
<p>"I believe the most interesting things are created when people with very different backgrounds work together on creative projects," says Alexander Souslov, Executive Producer on Darkwood 2. "Ice-Pick is known for its focus on narrative and on the design of semiotic systems. Hooded Horse, on the other hand, is renowned for its expertise in strategy. What kind of game could come from that? It has to be something so compelling that I’d want to play it myself. I’ve been genuinely impressed by their clear understanding of what developers face, their focus on success and mutual growth, and their dedication to long-term support for their games."</p>
<p>"Our collaboration is just beginning, but with people like this working together, I’m confident something truly special will come out of it," says Ice-Pick co-founder Ayrat Zakirov.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu getting optimisations for modern processors with architecture variants</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced they're working on architecture variants of Ubuntu, to hopefully result in better optimisation and performance on modern processors.</p>
<p>Posted today on the Ubuntu Discourse forum, developer Michael Hudson Doyle they note how Ubuntu has a focus on wide compatibility but there is a performance trade-off with it. So with Ubuntu 25.10, they've now added support for packages that "target specific silicon variants, meaning you can have your cake and eat it too". The first supported is amd64v3 (x86-64-v3) that should be supported on Intel Haswell / AMD Excavator and above.</p>
<p>For those wanting to squeeze every possible bit of performance out of their machines, this sounds like a nice upgrade for Canonical to be working on.</p>
<p>As Doyle said they've made changes to dpkg, apt and Launchpad to support building multiple version of packages for different levels of the x86-64 architecture. Some packages are now available on an opt-in basis for the x86-64-v3 architecture level.</p>
<p>The current aim is to have the Ubuntu 26.04 LTS release have all packages rebuilt and ready for the x84-64-v3 / amd64v3 architecture.</p>
<p>You can test it out yourself right now on an Ubuntu install. See the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/introducing-architecture-variants-amd64v3-now-available-in-ubuntu-25-10/71312" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> for details.</p>

      <title>Bazzite using Fedora 43 is out now with full Xbox Ally / Xbox Ally X support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> Linux has been upgraded with the Fedora 43 release, and it comes with many handheld gaming enhancements for those wanting to break away from Windows.</p>
<p>With this release they've added full support for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, although they note there's an issue with the Xbox Ally X above 80% volume they're currently trying to track down with the makers of the amplifier. So for now you'll need to keep an eye on that. Great to see support arrive though, since multiple reports (like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) are out there about how much better the devices run with Bazzite compared with Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/52787831761829276gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's also expanded support for the Legion Go 2, although it's not <em>completely</em> finished yet as it's missing "HDR PQ" but it also adds support for the two new buttons below the d-pad. Support for the OneXPlayer X1 Air was also added but currently missing granular TDP controls. And, the weird crypto handheld SuiPlay0X1 is also now supported.</p>
<p>You also get the latest GNOME 49 and KDE Plasma 6.4 desktop environments, continued NVIDIA support for older GPUs, improvements to the Bazaar app store, Steering Wheel support and more.</p>
<p>Overall, another fantastic sounding release from the Bazzite team - easily the best way to get something like SteamOS on various different handhelds, TV PCs and more.</p>
<p>See all in the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-fall-update-fedora-43-xbox-allies-legion-go-2-nvidia-gtx/10948" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a>.</p>

      <title>The extraction shooter ARC Raiders is out and appears to work on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARC Raiders from Embark Studios has released today and even though it has anti-cheat, it still appears to run just fine on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>What is it? A PvPvE extraction shooter set in a world filled with lethal machines, where humans live underground and go raiding for supplies up top. You can play it alone, or in a squad of up to three players. It's all about risk versus reward, with the loop of running around dangerous areas to find loot.</p>
<p>Much like The Finals from the same developer, ARC Raiders also has Easy Anti-Cheat but it appears they have it enabled here as well since I've had no problems jumping into it today to test it out with the release. Embark didn't reply to repeated emails from GamingOnLinux to talk about Linux and Proton, but still nice to see it working. For now, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page lists it as working</a>.</p>
<p>On my Desktop system with Kubuntu 25.10 and an AMD Radeon 6800 XT (Mesa 25.2.3) with Proton 9 it wouldn't load it at all, but swapping over the Proton version to Proton Experimental and so far I haven't encountered a single issue. Performance is good enough at 2560x1440 with all settings on Epic, with AMD FSR 3 Balanced it so far hasn't dipped below 60FPS even once and feels great overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9622143381761822906gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9622143381761822906gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20694098481761822931gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20694098481761822931gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm hoping that we don't see it constantly break on Linux with Proton like we do fairly often with The Finals, and for it to just keep working like it is now as it's quite impressive. Again, it shows Linux can be an excellent platform for gaming - as long as developers don't actively block it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11394761091761823862gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11394761091761823862gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11646250461761823866gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11646250461761823866gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's an extraction shooter, it's very tense. Your group can encounter another group of players at any time, and as I found it in my first group session - some people will shoot first and ask questions later. Other times, people will wave and ask you not to shoot, so you all put away your weapons and slowly walk away from each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6262155171761824911gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6262155171761824911gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2740388781761824914gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2740388781761824914gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just other players here though, there's also all the different machines you're fighting against both on land and in the air that make it quite a rush to run through and so some looting. Weird little speedy spider things that creep me out, exploding roller balls, multiple flying machines with guns and plenty more.</p>
<p>Once you're done looting with a nice full backpack, you can extract from different locations on the map to return home to craft, trade, pick up more quests and so on. Each extraction point has a limited timer and extracting isn't always easy since other players might be stalking it, or there might machines flying around that take notice of the noise. Like what happened to my group earlier, as multiple flying NPCs were around the extraction point and downed us both. But here's where it's not too punishing, you can <em>still</em> crawl and activate the extraction. Which I thought was a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699970831761825547gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699970831761825547gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Downed by not out, we managed to extract in the above picture. Phew.</em></p>
<p>However, I wouldn't be doing my full duty here though if I didn't point out the generative AI message on Steam, which the developers put up that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the developer has confirmed multiple times elsewhere that this type of AI is only used for text to speech for voice barks like "go over here" or to point out items in the world using the same text-to-speech system as in The Finals. For this they hired actual voice actors too as noted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RPS</a>.</p>
<p>There's also numerous in-game purchases, plenty of which are not particularly cheap for the customization.</p>
<p>The game has only just begun life, and I've only just begun exploring it, so likely more to come on this one from me. Hopefully not a report on the anti-cheat suddenly being blocked but we'll see.</p>
<p>Right now, Fanatical has it with 14% off.</p>

<p>GOG seems to be getting more good stuff lately like the release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-now-on-gog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gog-preservation-program-expands-with-splinter-cell-hitman-and-more-autumn-sale-is-on/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Splinter Cell, Hitman and others entering the GOG Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to see more options available for gamers, especially since most developers just default to Steam (which is not a surprise). Options are good though, as is competition between stores for us.</p>

      <title>Minecraft Java modding is about to get a lot easier and more interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang announced a big change is coming to Minecraft: Java Edition, one that could make it a whole lot easier to make mods and perhaps make them more exciting.</p>
<p>While Minecraft has a long history of modding and there's some truly massive mods out there, the game has been using obfuscation to make it more difficult to pick it apart. Something that is quite normal in the software industry as one tool in the box to protect games. But, that's now going to change as they're completely removing the obfuscation!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16727030411761757023gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When? Quite soon actually. They said the first snapshot after the full Mounts of Mayhem launch will no longer obfuscate the code.</p>
<p>It will take time for modders to catch up with the changes, since everything will be so open now and a lot of tools were built with the obfuscation in mind but it will make it massively easier in the long-run.</p>
<p>This is a genuinely great move. I'm excited to see what happens next for modders.</p>
<p>However, the cynic in me says this suggests that it's a step towards Mojang eventually retiring Minecraft Java and going all-in on the modern Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (which doesn't have Linux support). Hope I am wrong on that though, but having two entirely separate versions is likely not something the higher ups at Microsoft want to continue forever.</p>
