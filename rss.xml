      <title>Kaiju Cleaner Simulator will get you and friends to clean up massive titans together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's another game coming out that will have you clean up the bodies of massive creatures, with Kaiju Cleaner Simulator seeing you and friends team up for it. No battling here, it's all about the aftermath and what comes next.</p>
<p>I'll admit, I got a bit <em>confused</em> when this entered the GamingOnLinux inbox yesterday, because I actually thought it was one I had already covered called <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/youre-on-colossal-cleaning-duty-in-kaiju-cleanup/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kaiju Cleanup that was announced recently</a>. You'll see my problem there right? One is <em>Kaiju Cleanup</em> and this is <em>Kaiju Cleaner Simulator</em> and both only recent reveals. Oh my. Seems two different teams had near enough the exact same idea. This doesn't seem to be some copycat though, as this game seemed to have a Steam page being prepared even before Kaiju Cleanup that just happened to be announced first it seems.</p>
<p>With Kaiju Cleaner Simulator, it's not solo game since up to 4 players can get cleaning together. A bit more chaotic perhaps than the other game. The developers mention this will lean into the more humorous and absurd side of things. In their own words: "Unexpected situations and quirky monster designs bring lighthearted moments to the gritty tasks of cleaning up after kaiju rampages, creating a perfect mix of dark comedy and simulation fun".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below, which is a bit short on actual gameplay though:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YNHivYHib_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d80a9e41476415cf19fd7f6187f71085.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YNHivYHib_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interesting to see their no AI notice at the start, I think we're about to see more developers do such things since there's an increasing amount of AI slop out there. </p>
<p>From the press release: âAfter watching Kaiju No. 8, we thought maybe being a kaiju cleaner is even tougher than being their exterminator. Itâs a job for real tough guys. Our game is for those who arenât afraid to get their hands dirty and turn chaos into fun,â says One More Time. </p>
<p>A Steam playtest is scheduled to begin early next year. With a release planned sometime in Q2 2026.</p>

      <title>Deep colony sim Stardeus adds a huge new narrative-focused update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Because there was always going to be some drama in deep space right? Stardeus is a spaceship colony sim that just expanded in a huge way.</p>
<p>The Story and Drama Update brings with it a huge overhaul and expansion to the narrative systems. They said it includes "new levels of narrative depth, social complexity, and emotional storytelling to the colony simulation experience" which sounds quite fancy. You may find some colonists now might get a bit <em>stabby</em> towards another if they're annoyed enough with them â ouch. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14196197171760708438gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14196197171760708438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Stardeus is just a overall lot more social now with lots more interactions between colonists like a bit of casual chat or even weddings, there's a lot that can happen in a run now.</p>
<p>What we get is a completely rebuilt story generation system, which is supposed to be more flexible to provide a vast range of dynamic story events. You'll also get to see a new raid management system with it being influenced by colony strength, recent losses, and other in-game factors along with new types of raids to up the challenge.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Update Overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Story Generation System.</li>
<li>New Raid System and Raid Types.</li>
<li>New Colony Drama System and Social Relationships.</li>
<li>Visible Eyes and Unique Faces.</li>
<li>New Story Events.</li>
<li>Ashes, Urns, and Mourning.</li>
<li>Scars and Cause of Death.</li>
<li>Fire and Explosions.</li>
<li>UI Improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1380910/view/508463020330975744" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> is rather long (seriously - that's a lot of additions) and there's a 23 minutes video from the developer that goes over all of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BQpx-vaFHps"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5fb3b1fb4894a92e855fafa4b4d314b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BQpx-vaFHps" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This might end up as one of the deepest strategy games around.</p>
<p>Stardeus has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The popular physics sandbox game Brick Rigs has added Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice surprise, Brick Rigs is another game that recently added Native Linux support and it's quite a popular choice along with it being highly rated. It has a Very Positive overall Steam user review score from close to 50,000 reviews.</p>
<p>The Linux support arrived in an update on October 17th, with the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552100/view/553504715299619081" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noting</a> they chose to add support to "improve performance and stability by avoiding compatibility layers such as Proton or Wine". Interesting to see, something that we also saw with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-native-linux-version-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/bloober-team-announce-a-native-steam-deck-release-for-cronos-the-new-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, although those were specifically for the Steam Deck whereas this is just general full Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2317127681760703726gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brick Rigs is a physics sandbox game that allows you to build, drive and destroy almost any type of vehicle imaginable. Whether it's a dragster, fire engine, forklift, helicopter, plane, train, ship or even a tank, you can probably build it in Brick Rigs.</p>
<p>You can also upload your creations to the Workshop to share them with the community. And if you donât feel like building anything, you can just download any of the over 200,000 creations already uploaded by other players.</p>
<p>The multiplayer mode allows you to experience these physics together with your friends. You can organize races, demolition derbies, dog fights or emergency scenarios. The rules are up to you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The update didn't just add Linux support, it also translated the game into 12 new languages. Plus they added AMD FSR support, and a number of other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The trailer is below, although it has no sound and it's quite dated at this point they don't seem to have any more that's up to date. They don't even list a YouTube anywhere I could find:</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum meets Vampire Survivors in the latest crossover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Museum has done a crossover update with Vampire Survivors, which really made me scratch my head but still fun to see. Oh right, it's nearing Halloween - the update makes just a little bit more sense now. <em>It's a free update for all existing owners of the game.</em></p>
<p>Vampire Survivors brings three stages to Two Point Museum's Digiverse map as new Points of Interest: the Mad Forest, Inlaid Library and Capella Magna. And some of Vampire Survivor's weapons have even made it into the game like Garlic, Spinach and Santa Water, serving as offensive weapons to grant bonuses to museum employees and relics that can put on display. There's 10 new exhibits to collect, along with new decor and a bundle of wallpapers and flooring with a Vampire Survivors theme.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MVfdLuyo9eU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eeefc7982b8b83d3c1b2950eaa74401f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MVfdLuyo9eU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>New trailer for Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown has a rather bald Borg crew member</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-gets-a-first-demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed promise from the demo</a> with some rough edges, but the new trailer has me excited about the journey.</p>
<p>But before getting into detailsâ¦what did they do to Seven of Nine?! Why do they have no hair? Or, do we get to pick an entirely <em>different</em> member of the Borg to join the crew? Quite possible given the nature of the game letting you do all sorts of different paths but I need answers.</p>
<p>Anyway, a new trailer has warped in going over a bunch of "what if" moments and it has definitely renewed my interest in seeing the whole journey through after the demo. It focuses on a specific plot-line in the adventure about gathering data, and the different paths you can take on handling it along with some consequences. I don't want to really spoil anything with details, but a certain Romulan scientist being a crew member was certainly a surprise to see as well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bqYgGynR3iU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/055016df3ad9d49af8803f88f9abf6a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bqYgGynR3iU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game really does have a great concept, so I'm keen to see what the end result will be once it's finished. The demo at least has a Very Positive overall rating from players on Steam with a lot of the negative reviews pointing out the lack of any voice acting (something that bugged me too).</p>

      <title>Assetto Corsa Rally announced for Early Access in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know there's a few rally fans reading so you might be excited to learn that Assetto Corsa Rally has been announced for Early Access on November 13th.</p>
<p>Coming from publisher 505 Games with <span style="font-size:16px">Supernova Games Studios taking development lead in </span>technical partnership with KUNOS Simulazioni. Coming with a bunch of officially licenses vehicles and tracks, it sounds quite promising.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U1_7q_gHrTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8e0f94c73bf9a3dd5d34c2ba88bf68f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U1_7q_gHrTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bunch of details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FOR A TRUE-TO-LIFE SIMULATION</strong></p>
<p>The proprietary physics engine developed by KUNOS Simulazioni has been adapted and refined to realistically simulate the unique dynamics of rally racing, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumps and uneven surfaces.</li>
<li>Slippery and variable road conditions.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather.</li>
<li>Realistic vehicle behavior across all types of terrain.</li>
</ul>
<p>A key element is the use of <strong>laser scan technology</strong> for every stage in each rally event, enabling <strong>accurate reproduction</strong> of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world terrain formations.</li>
<li>Road surface irregularities and characteristics.</li>
<li>Details of the surrounding environment like vegetation positioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach â for the first time in the rally sim genre - delivers an unprecedented level of realism, deepening the authenticity of the driving experience.</p>
<p>In parallel, the team at Supernova, leveraging its consolidated experience with Unreal Engine 5, has customized and optimized it to the specific needs of racing games, ensuring high visual fidelity and performance.</p>
<p><strong>CONTENT AND LOCATIONS</strong></p>
<p>At the start of Early Access, Assetto Corsa Rally will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>33km</strong> of fully laserscanned <strong>real life roads</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>4 Special Stages</strong> with <strong>18 variants</strong>, set across gravel roads in <strong>Wales</strong> and tarmac roads in <strong>Alsace</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>10 iconic rally cars</strong>, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>5 game modes, triple screen support</strong>, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete game aims to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over <strong>120 km of faithfully recreated rally stages</strong> using laser scan technology.</li>
<li><strong>10 Special Stages</strong> with over <strong>35 variants</strong> set across <strong>5 international rallies</strong>, with new roads and content added continuously.</li>
<li>A full car roster featuring over <strong>30 vehicles</strong> selected from the most iconic rally cars of the past and present.</li>
<li>New game modes, a <strong>rally school</strong>, a <strong>career mode</strong>, and complete <strong>VR support</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXTREME DETAIL AND IMMERSIVE AUDIO</strong></p>
<p>Each car has been recreated using laser scans and official CAD files, delivering uncompromising accuracy in every component.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced damage system</strong>: combines visual deformations with physical damage that directly impacts vehicle behavior, enhancing realism and challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The experience is further elevated by an audio system designed to maximize immersion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentic sound recordings: real-life acceleration, braking, and drifting sounds, captured both inside and outside the cockpit.</li>
<li>Co-driver pacenotes: developed in collaboration with professional co-drivers, featuring their original voices.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, weâve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts.", commented Mauro Notarberardino, Supernova Studio Director, "A special thanks goes to KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series - especially in terms of the driving model - in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we canât wait to share the journey with you."</p>
<p>My main concern is that they've confirmed it will have online multiplayer - so they might pull an EA here and stick in some anti-cheat and break it like we saw with EA SPORTS WRC. I've asked them to clarify any anti-cheat plans.</p>
<p>It will be priced at Â£24.99 / $29.99 / â¬29,99 at release. They said this is a "special price" so presumably it will cost more later.</p>

      <title>A famous meme comes to life in This Is Fine: Maximum Cope with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Memes, you gotta love 'em right? Question Hound from This Is Fine is getting a metroidvania platformer video game with This Is Fine: Maximum Cope. I must admit, this is the first I'm hearing of it, but it actually had a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign back in October last year where around $52,000 in funding was pulled in.</p>
<p>More about it: "Explore the landscapes, beat bosses, unlock abilities, and access new chapters. This is a metroidvania. As you platform your way through each world youâll encounter enemies, each an embodiment of everyday worries. Through navigation and persistence, you will ultimately face the challenging bosses unique to every area. Defeat them and acquire the abilities needed to progress further (and explore previous areas in more depth)!</p>
<p>Be sure to stop at every burning Rest Point to save, sip coffee, and pretend everything is fine for a brief moment. Collect Coffee Beans as you explore; your currency used to purchase perks and refill your healing coffee cup. Keep your eyes peeled everywhere you go if your heart is set on finding every quirky collectible!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>There's a demo available in Steam Next Fest, could be a good laugh. The animation style definitely reminds me of Cuphead.</p>

      <title>Looks like Farlight 84 is now broken on Linux with their latest anti-cheat video calling it out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farlight 84 is a battle royale hero shooter that now appears to be fully broken on Linux, thanks to updates to their anti-cheat.</p>
<p>The Steam store page still lists it as using Easy Anti-Cheat and it did previously work quite well. However, they've just launched the new "Weaver of Wonders" season and there's reports flowing in about it not working at all.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a few weeks ago on September 25th, they put up a new video going over their anti-cheat work noting they're using "Full Lifecycle Anti-Cheat Protection". Along with that, around 2:17 into the video they begin to talk about the ways people cheat using the likes of emulators and virtual machines. It's here Linux gets a direct mention too, although they don't go into any detail at all on the Linux side of things. But clearly, they saw the ability to play Farlight 84 on Linux as a problem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hdo8vCJU0gw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8007f62bf8a29bf09d70ea57168cf6b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hdo8vCJU0gw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is not the first time Farlight 84 has broken, but it seems like it may be the last time where it stays broken if Linux is a direct target for them like this.</p>
<p>A real shame to see yet another online multiplayer game blocked, because developers see Linux as a platform for cheat developers and just decide to block it as the simple choice. We've seen so many games entirely block Linux now including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/battlefield-6-releases-today-and-it-will-not-be-playable-on-any-linux-steamos-system/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/full-circle-ea-confirm-again-that-skate-will-not-support-linux-steam-deck-or-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">skate.</a>, EA Sports FC / Madden and basically any modern EA game. Various games using ACE like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/that-didnt-last-long-blue-protocol-star-resonance-anti-cheat-causing-problems-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/delta-force-devs-say-desktop-linux-support-is-not-part-of-our-agenda-in-the-future/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/anti-cheat-looks-like-a-no-go-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-for-arena-breakout-infinite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arena Breakout: Infinite</a> and more</p>

      <title>Nightdive release definitive PC update for I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios announced the definitive update for I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream has now landed on PC with Linux support. This brings over a bunch of enhancements done for the console release, making it better for everyone.</p>
<p>More about it: "Based on the post-apocalyptic short story by renowned author Harlan Ellison, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream plunges players deep within the center of the earth, where they play as each of the five survivors who have been trapped in the bowels of the insane AI AM for the past 109 years. Fueled by his intense hatred for the human race, AM has spent the past century torturing and toying with each character as he sees fit, culminating in a final game: an appropriately meta adventure-style quest for each of them, teasing the prospect of freedom if they succeed."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The definitive update adds:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Black Myth: Wukong gets a big performance update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Myth: Wukong might actually now be playable on the Steam Deck, with the latest update out now that focuses on performance. Pretty great to see developer Game Science still working to improve it after release!</p>
<p>What is it? Launched back in August 2024, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredible popular action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology. It has a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 800,000 user reviews. According to <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>, it is the 13th most popular game of all time on Steam â really impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3527039741760634117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Along with some bug fixes, there's a good few tweaks to the game to improve the performance including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Integrated AMD FSR4. On compatible hardware, it will be available in the in-game Settings after updating the driver and enabling FSR4 in the driver settings.</li>
<li>Improved Compatible Mode. Now, with Compatible Mode enabled, ray tracing, frame generation, and some super-resolution functions will be temporarily disabled to help players avoid game launch failures caused by driver, hardware, or system abnormalities.</li>
<li>Adjusted the default graphics settings for certain graphics cards to match the various graphical changes in the current game version.</li>
<li>Significantly improved the lighting quality when Global Illumination is set to low, making it closer to the effect when Global Illumination is set to high.</li>
<li>Improved CPU and rendering performance in numerous scenarios.</li>
<li>Improved memory usage in numerous scenarios.</li>
<li>Improved the quality of motion blur to mitigate the aliasing issues that occur when the camera pans.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The last update before this was back in April that added in NVIDIA DLSS 4.0 and Intel XeSS 2.0.</p>

      <title>The Siege Update for Dwarf Fortress lands November 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The exciting sounding Siege Update for Dwarf Fortress now has a release date, with it set to arrive on November 3rd and here's what's coming with it.</p>
<p>Some of what's been detailed about the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New enemy weapons:</strong> Battering rams, trolls can now carry giant pickaxes and blocks for building<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New enemy behaviours:</strong> Enemy behaviour is now classified into different roles (charge, hang back, ambush) and can path around dangerous areas. Engineers can build floors and stairs. Enemies can break through fortifications and raised bridges. They can also dig underground through natural walls. Goblins also bring more kinds of mounts and their demonic leader<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New weapon:</strong> Bolt thrower. This is a siege engine with a fixed location but can be turned freely in any direction. It fires faster than a crossbow and the ammo bin can hold 100 bolts. Siege operator skill matters but unskilled operators can use it more effectively than they use hand-held weapons.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Reworked weapons:</strong> Ballistas and catapults are more effective<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Changes to traps:</strong> Goblins can rescue caged allies. Water and magma traps will not be as effective as before, so youâll have to try a variety of defensive tools instead of relying just on one, to properly protect your forts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More detail on it will be noted on launch day, but for now you can watch the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5pvlCOF9HfI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b95e2c2272f01412d2ecd22debd00016.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5pvlCOF9HfI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also teased a little about the future with plans for "more magical content and features, such as warlords and demon-trained sorcerers that could make sieges on your fort even more dangerous and varied". </p>
<p>All sounds great to me. Nice to see it continue to expand with a whole lot more.</p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster is coming to Steam with more upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster originally launched as an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-out-now-on-gog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusive to GOG</a>, but that's not going to last with a newer edition announced and a Steam release.</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed that they're doing a new "Croc Legend of the Gobbos Platinum Edition", which they had to tweak due to some PlayStation trophy issue. But, it's also coming with a bunch of other enhancements for everyone along with a Steam release now too.</p>
<p>What's new in this edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new time trial gameplay mode called Time Attack</li>
<li>25+ new additions to the Crocipedia.</li>
<li>The ability to toggle between different Croc Main Theme mixes in the main menu. </li>
<li>A bunch of bug fixes were squashed. Ker-Splat!</li>
<li>A handful of quality-of-life features and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be a free update if you have it on GOG already.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uxrs4_C3QwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db84d4d06ffed6af8fedd6766fdae525.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uxrs4_C3QwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They seem to have messed up on the release dates though. According to the press release it was supposed to launch on Steam on October 13th, with the other platforms today. But the Steam page just notes it's "Coming Soon". So it might be today, it might not. Either way, nice to see it come to Steam too for those that prefer it.</p>

      <title>Open world exploration game Outbound looks super cosy and hit over 1 million Steam wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Outbound looks like a game I need right now, a chilled cosy open-world exploration game about living off-grid and building up your dream minivan.</p>
<p>Seems it's been a popular one too, with it being announced that its hit over 1 million Steam wishlists. And, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that makes it currently about the 23rd most wishlisted upcoming game on Steam. Nice reminder, since I had missed this one when it was initially announced and now I can't wait to go through it.</p>
<p>More about it: "Outbound is an open-world exploration game set in a utopian near future. Start with an empty camper van and turn it into the home of your dreams - alone or together with your friends. Build and explore at your own pace. Scavenge materials, craft, and build in and on top of your vehicle with modular parts. Advance in technology and efficiently use energy to power your home. Adjust your playstyle to adapt to new landscapes and changing environmental conditions."</p>
<p>Their latest trailer is below, which is for the Alpha testing so keep in mind it's not finished:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s9B9xl_cPA8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63db334493b83ed7a1b1ab168a179c00.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s9B9xl_cPA8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: âHitting one million wishlists is a dream come true,â said Marc Volger, co-founder of Square Glade Games. âOur community has been incredible from day one, and now, with our backers helping us test the game hands-on, weâre one big step closer to creating the cozy road-trip experience everyoneâs been waiting for.â</p>
<p>Releasing next year it will be playable solo or in online co-op for up to 4 players.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Your Dream Van</strong> â Expand, decorate, and personalise your camper to suit your vibe.</li>
<li><strong>Harvest Natureâs Power</strong> â Harness solar, wind, and water energy to fuel your off-grid lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>Live Sustainably</strong> â Grow your own food, forage, and cook wholesome meals under open skies.</li>

      <title>Surviving Mars: Relaunched arrives November 10 with two expansions planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that Surviving Mars: Relaunched is now set to blast off on November 10th with a discount for owners of the original. Valve have also given it a Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible rating ahead of release. The main issue for the Steam Deck being some text that's too small.</p>
<p>With this re-release you get everything the original had, expansions and all. Plus upgraded visuals, an improved UI, and the all-new Martian Assembly in-game political mechanics, better modding support and various other general improvements to the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cYdb13fqECo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c3b50dd9ce2d268f0380d3b04fa3ad6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cYdb13fqECo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We're also going to see two expansions coming next year - Feeding the Future and Machine Utopia. The first will focus on expanding food and production systems, introducing deeper management options, and meal choices that affect comfort and sanity. The second with Machine Utopia will introduce mechanized labor and massive industrial options to the red planet.</p>
<p>The latest video on the game can be seen below, going over some of the end-game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZYEqPugZk5s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0bd3a7346edb64b3eb6445f7894ab7f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZYEqPugZk5s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The base price will be $39.99 / Â£34.99 / â¬39.99 but if you own the original it will be $19.99 / Â£17.50 / â¬19.99. They've also announced the pricier Ultimate Edition which comes with an Expansion Pass for the two planned expansions. The Ultimate Edition will be $59.99 / Â£49.99 / â¬59.99 or $39.99 / Â£34.99 / â¬39.99 if you have the original game.</p>
<p>I still love the original but it wasn't without flaws, I'm hopeful this release goes well, at least better than Paradox have been doing with their other games lately. I still feel a little uneasy about re-selling the game with updates, to push even more with expansions again though but it's quite typical of Paradox - they no doubt want the relaunch to be the basis for even more expansions after.</p>

      <title>The Outlast Trials is getting a brutal looking PvP invasion mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Get ready to be terrified all over again, as The Outlast Trials is set to get a major update adding in a spooky and brutal PvP mode. <em>It works great on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>Arriving as a free update on October 21st, the game will introduce a special new PvP Invasion Mode. This will allow you to enter the Trials of other players and sabotage them resulting in some pretty brutal looking outcomes for the players caught up in the web of lies. Looks like you'll need a spare pair of pants for this one.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ukYbwtMdwo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89153c57a6a30ef93063ea5c69853d58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ukYbwtMdwo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessed via the Sleep Room Terminals, the new Invasion Mode allows players to join as either a Reagent or an Imposter. Only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial, but while the others wait, they can be the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. Each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial, as their peers succeed in their sabotageâ¦or die trying.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of New PvP Invasion Mode:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Become the Hunter</strong> â Stalk your prey from the shadows, utilizing stealth and subterfuge to sneak up on unsuspecting Reagents before going in for the kill.</li>
<li><strong>Surveil the Trials </strong>â Plan your route and attack strategy by carefully considering surveillance camera footage. Your fellow Imposters</li>
<li><strong>Don a Deadly Disguise</strong> â Dress yourself in the garb and skin of your targets to gain their trust. Then, when the momentâs rightâ¦</li>
<li><strong>Stab Them In the Back</strong> â Close-quarters combat is the only rule of engagement. Outwit your opponent with multiple blade strikes or a single, lethal stab attack. One slip up means certain death, ratcheting up the intensity in the high-pressure Trial arenas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There will also be a new time limited event, new challenges and a new in-game store.</p>

<p>Team Cherry certainly are getting these patches out rapidly, they only just launched <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-3-1-0-28891-brings-a-lot-of-fixes-and-dualsense-edge-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patch 3 for Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and now Patch 4 has a Beta.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help for those running the Native Linux version, where controller input has been a bit of a nuisance with multiple issues. The list below is only tentative, as they said the patch is still in progress so more fixes are expected to be added before it goes live for all players.</p>
<p>Here's the current list of changes in Patch 4 Beta (v1.0.28954):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Updated Simplified Chinese translation with a new script for public testing. <strong>This is a basic implementation only,</strong> to be refined and updated based on player feedback.<br/>
- Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.<br/>
- Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognised. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please visit: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/<span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1675797b3863787f626f387f78666362656f6562737b5627382722">[emailÂ protected]</span>/manual/SupportedDevices.html</a><br/>
- Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.<br/>
- Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.<br/>
- Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.<br/>
- Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).<br/>
- Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.<br/>
- Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.<br/>
- Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.<br/>
- Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.5 released with major bug fix for Intel graphics on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.5 would normally be just another small point-release bug fix, but in this case it's a little extra special for Intel GPU owners on Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/37498" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This merge request</a> that was accepted and pulled into Mesa on October 13th from developer Sagar Ghuge actually reverted a previous bit of code, which as turns out was quite problematic for newer Intel GPU owners. There were a fair few bug reports across Age of Wonders 4, Dirt Rally 2.0, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Assassin's Creed Shadows and so on reporting graphical issues. It took a while to track down, but the issue should now be solved.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the work that went into finding the problem, gaming on Linux with a newer Intel GPU should be a whole lot better. Just look at how bad Age of Wonders 4 was on an Intel Arc B580:</p>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages gets a major performance upgrade for handhelds - now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>id Software just released a major performance update for DOOM: The Dark Ages, making it run a whole lot better on handhelds like the Steam Deck. Thanks to the update it's also now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>This is some really impressive upgrades, and just shows that you can squeeze out playable performance even at the lower end while keeping visuals looking good.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/535490230242771018?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the game will go through auto detection for handhelds, but you can still customize the settings. Plus, settings are now stored per-device too so no messing with other systems you play on.</p>
<p>The update includes general performance improvements specific to handhelds, advanced optimization settings specifically for handhelds, they optimized SFX and VFX specifically for handhelds and there's a new handheld benchmark mode too. From the announcement they noted the expected performance across devices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Performance depends on selected power mode and whether the device is attached to a dedicated power source. Values detailed here assume the device is using the highest power setting in the OS and is not running from battery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck : 720p @ ~30FPS</li>
<li>Z1 Devices : 720p @ ~30FPS (such as ASUS ROG Ally)</li>
<li>Z1E Devices : 1080p @ ~30FPS (such as ASUS ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go)</li>
<li>Z2A Devices : 720p @ ~30FPS (such as XBOX ROG Ally)</li>
<li>Z2E Devices : 1080p @ ~60FPS (such as XBOX ROG Ally X)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13477691421760604943gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that they also said they added QOL input improvements when handhelds are docked to a stand and new controller detection on handhelds for wireless and wired external controllers.</p>
<p>There's also a whole bunch of general fixes and tweaks to the game for all platforms.</p>
<p>I think, realistically, we have the launch of the Xbox ROG Ally handhelds to thank for this sort of update, since Bethesda Softworks is owned by Microsoft they want more games to run smoothly on the Xbox ROG Ally X and especially the lower-end Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

      <title>BALL x PIT is out now and it&#39;s a brick-breaking ball-smashing great time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BALL x PIT from Kenny Sun / Devolver Digital is out now and it's Steam Deck Verified plus it works to perfection on Desktop Linux PCs (Proton 9 tested). <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Taking a healthy dose of inspiration from all the survivor-likes that have appeared since Vampire Survivors, BALL x PIT takes the basic idea of brick-breaking from the likes of Arkanoid and Breakout and turns it into something truly absorbing of your time. Day will turn to night as you play through this one, it really is something else. But it's more than just that, since it throws in its own little version of town-building into the mixture as well. It's like the developer threw some bouncing sticky balls at a wall full of ideas and said yep - I'll take it all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15223496101760548279gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15223496101760548279gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's the story here then? In the brief intro, we're told that the great city has been annihilated by some massive big shiny ball in the sky. What's left is nothing but a deep dark pit. So naturally, you and others decide to venture down into the pit for resources, lost treasures and to fight the rising hordes of monsters.</p>
<p>The basic setup is that you're fighting through a scrolling arena where you're constantly walking up, while the enemy blocks are constantly shuffling down towards you. You're armed though, with a great many balls. These balls can be powered up as you go through a run as you acquire experience orbs from downed enemies to level up, to give you all sorts of fancy effects which can be pretty over the top at times. Magnificent to watch though and just totally zone out with it as your balls tear through all the blocks.</p>
<p>Your balls can be fired manually, or automatically, but either way you're involved â you have to actually aim. You also do need to be constantly on the move in all directions to avoid enemy fire as well. If the enemies get to too close to you or reach the bottom, it's time to say goodbye to your health. If you find it challenging you can slow it down, but you can also speed it up too. <em>It's nice to have options.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1229960651760548786gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1229960651760548786gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just enemies and enemy fire you're running around to dodge for, as you'll also want to catch those balls. If you miss you have to wait until they bounce to the end of the screen and back to you. But, if you catch them, you can throw them again. You can also unlock certain upgrades for your run based on actually catching those special powered balls too, there's quite a lot to think about.</p>
<p>The release trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="18pHUtXzF2w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5793195add458906516ad3dc50e85a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/18pHUtXzF2w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes it really exciting is seeing all the ball combinations. There's a fusion system which helpfully keeps your rather limited inventory from getting overloaded, where you combine two upgraded balls into one. This is where things start to get a bit wild, because you can make some utterly ludicrous weapons with it. Like one ball that fires a horizontal laser across an entire row when it hits, and also makes them all bleed. Pair that up with a ghost ball that you can fire through a bunch of enemies, that also fires a laser vertically â and it becomes a constant laser death show.</p>
<p>Oh you thought that was it? Wrong. You can also <em>evolve</em> upgraded fused balls into something even <em>more</em> powerful.</p>
<p>There's more still as there's also a number of different characters to unlock to play as. Each of them comes with their own different play-style and starter ball for you to experiment with. This is part of where the grind is though, to unlock more of them by going through each level (which you also have to grind a bit to unlock) to reach certain stages where you can then build some more in your little town to access more characters. All buildings requiring various amounts of different resources you can find during a run, or gather in-between runs but it's a bit <em>slow</em> going on that.</p>
<p>Add to that that each character will individually level up as you play more rounds with them too, there so many features blended into this package to keep you wanting more. It really wants you to play not just one, or two but many more rounds before you finally go to bed.</p>
<p>The result of the mechanics is that it's quite challenging as you progress through it due to the different enemies, their layout and weapons they can fire at you, and the fact that you're constantly moving. Add to that the boss fights as well, which can be ridiculously <em>brutal</em>, especially if your balls aren't the best at fighting that particular boss. This is where I think it fails a bit, because it feels a bit like you're forced into using certain builds. Like the first boss, it can only really be damaged from a hit to the back of it. I had a run where I just could barely touch it at all - it felt like a waste, apart from all the resources I had gathered.</p>
<p>Aside from that one gripe where there's a chance I'm just not quite getting the trick to some of the bosses with the ball bouncing, it's brilliant.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fuse Your Balls: combine over 60 randomised balls to create chaotic, overpowered synergies.</li>
<li>Build New Ballbylon: construct over 70 unique structures to power up, unlock heroes, and expand your empire.</li>
<li>Explore New Realms: battle through deserts, caverns, and forests teeming with bizarre foes and massive bosses.</li>
<li>Recruit Fellow Hunters: team up with treasure-seeking heroes that change the way you play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>BALL x PIT is a truly unique blend of many things that will keep you captive for hours. Easy to get into and an easy recommendation to anyone who loves a fresh spin on a classic with a blend of new ideas.</p>

      <title>Valve add an easy way to see all the bundles a Steam game is in</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of developers like to team up for their games to put them in bundles, so Valve made it easier to see all bundles for each game on Steam.</p>
<p>As long as a game is in 3 or more bundles you'll now see a new link below the last bundle show on a Steam store page. Like the example below of "See all 7 bundles" for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Balatro</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17976059981760538885gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And when you click it, you'll be sent to a whole new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundlelist/2379780/Balatro" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bundle list page</a> to present all the packages that include it. A pretty nice way to see if you can save some monies on various games together, perhaps you might find some more that interest you and end up buying a bundle this way. Steam bundles automatically adjust the price based on what you already have, and this page works the same - it's personal to you.</p>
<p>By default it will sort them by the most popular (by revenue for each bundle). Although you can change it to sort by price, discount, or alphabetical by name.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13605686021760538965gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can also just head direct to a bundle page for any game on Steam if you grab their app ID via: https://store.steampowered.com/bundlelist/*appid*</p>

      <title>Uncle Leeâs Cookbook will bring five episodes of point and click adventuring while you save the universe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Uncle Lee's Cookbook: Five Recipes for Disaster was recently announced that will bring five interesting point and click adventures to Linux / Steam Deck. Relatively Painless Games have teamed up with Dionous Games to bring all of the entries in the Ines &amp; Uncle Lee series into one episodic game. </p>
<p>One of the episodes at least was previously covered on GamingOnLinux back in 2024 with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/save-a-town-from-paranormal-infestation-in-the-point-and-click-adventure-the-founders-of-redacted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The founders of [redacted]</a>. With this brand new bundled edition the developers told me they will be "polishing and revising them, and most importantly by adding voices to the games" and now a demo is available too. They also told me "the game is Linux native and is fully developed on Linux, and this time we also have Steam Deck support with controller input".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MLiU-v1jyK0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4b658088fead6684bc22869979af8dd0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MLiU-v1jyK0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncle Lee has done it again. And again. And again. And again. And again. Itâs up to you to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>Join rebellious teen Ines as she deals with the fallout of her uncle Leeâs experiments/inventions/cookingâonly you can help her save the universe!</p>
<p>Experience five episodes of reality-bending puzzles, witty dialogues, weird characters, and gorgeous pixel art (no, <strong>you </strong>are biased) in a wonderful package of point &amp; click gloriousness. You get all of the adventures of Ines and uncle Lee for the first time all together, revised and improved, and most importantly WITH VOICES. What more could you want?</p>

      <title>Many developers leave GZDoom due to leader conflicts and fork it into UZDoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drama in open source land, as a major conflict has caused many developers to leave GZDoom behind to fork it into <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UZDoom</a>. <em>It seems like going forward most people will end up using UZDoom.</em></p>
<p>What actually happened? In the official <a href="https://dsc.gg/zdoom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> server that covers ZDoom and related projects, an announcement was put up by a moderator noting "Due to a conflict between GZDoom's lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl, a lot of other developers decided to leave GZDoom and work on a new fork of the engine now known as UZDoom".</p>
<p>They continued to note that "UZDoom is a direct continuation of GZDoom and will inherit all of its features (and add more eventually)" but the point is that it will have "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads'".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14137096721760529660gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom Infinite</em></p>
<p>Looking a bit further into it, a <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> on the GZDoom GitHub page titled "Project management" was opened that gave a little more detail noting issues with the lead of GZDoom pushing untested code, using an LLM to write code and hiding "not insignificant changes in commits, which has people worried that you'll randomly rip out features that they rely on". In reply, the project lead simply <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3402316482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> "Feel free to fork the project under a" (yes, that really all they said).</p>
<p>A later <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3403606864" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">comment</a> before the bug report was locked points out the specific <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> in GZDoom that was made with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Really a shame when such incredible projects go through issues like this. Hopefully the ZDoom / UZDoom will come out healthier and stronger from this with a more community orientated approach to the code.</p>

      <title>Grab the new demo for Tiny Auto Knights, a pretty chill and fun looking PvP auto battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Auto Knights is an upcoming release from Mumpitz Games with a demo now available that now has Native Linux support for it. Seems like a nice way to spend a few hours, if auto battling PvP is your thing.</p>
<p>A little more about it for you: "Recruit heroes with unique skills and place them strategically on the field. Merge the same characters to level them up and get access to more powerful skills. Optimize your team and create strong synergies. When the battle starts, your characters will fight automatically and use their skills. Where they are on the battlefield determines the order of attacks and skills. Status effects like armor, poison, or bleeding make the combat even deeper.</p>
<p>Win battles to earn Unlock Tokens! Use these tokens to get new characters and add them to your custom deck. Find unexpected combinations and perfect your strategy. Share your decks with the community and friends â and try out their creations."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j8XpzoXDb1k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a308a767b00f0c6add18df58e3a0f04a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j8XpzoXDb1k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about making it supported directly on Linux the developer noted how "It was running quite okay with Proton before, but I could see performance improvements (more stable FPS and less fan noise) on my very old Laptop (Intel i5-4210U, AMD Radeon R7 M260) running Lubuntu 24.04.3 LTS with the native build".</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play against teams of other players:</strong> Discover and learn new strategies</li>
<li><strong>No turn timer:</strong> Take as much time as you want</li>
<li><strong>Ranked and Casual mode:</strong> Play competitive or have a relaxing time</li>
<li><strong>Compete in weekly challenges:</strong> Find the strongest build from a curated deck</li>
<li><strong>Find relics:</strong> Get passive bonuses to complement your team</li>
<li><strong>Create custom decks:</strong> Choose from dozens of unique characters</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 29th anniversary is here and they need your funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE, the free software community that develops the likes of the KDE Plasma desktop, has turned 29 years old and they're doing a fresh fund-raiser. <em>Hard to imagine the Linux space without KDE nowadays isn't it? </em></p>
<p>Just like they did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/kdes-end-of-year-fundraiser-is-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last year</a>, they're doing a years end fundraising effort in the hopes of gathering at least â¬50,000. Last year the initial goal was â¬30,000 but they ended up raising around â¬54,115. Perhaps this year we can beat that? Since launching it has so far raised just â¬7,209.65 according to the daily updates.</p>
<p>Not sure where I would be in my own Linux journey without KDE and Plasma. No other desktop environment fits me. Plasma isn't perfect, but their attention to the detail and long list of features and customisation really allow me to feel like it's /home.</p>
<p>From the funding page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE is on the verge of something big, and the popularity of its free software is on the rise. Itâs increasingly being adopted by gamers, artists, professionals, companies, and public institutions. But the costs associated with developing and maintaining that software are also growing.</p>
<p>A core aim of KDE is keeping you in control of your digital life, and we do it by providing high-quality and privacy-conscious free software. But we can only keep doing it by preserving our own financial independence, so that we never become too dependent on any single source of support.</p>
<p>This week is also <a href="https://weee-forum.org/iewd-about/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">International E-Waste Day</a>, and KDE wants a clean planet too! We started the <a href="https://endof10.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">End of 10</a> campaign because big tech corporations continue pushing everyone to chase the new shinyâ¦ in the process filling landfills with perfectly functional devices that become terrible sources of pollution when junked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important ending note there, since Windows 10 support has officially ended. If your PC doesn't support the stricter requirements of Windows 11, Microsoft think you should just buy a new PC. Or, you could install Linux and keep using it for a long time.</p>
<p>Check out the fundraiser on <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the KDE website</a>.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to the KDE community.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Hammerwatch II gets new content and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Hammerwatch II from Crackshell / Team17 just released the first free major update to the rogue-lite action-rpg, along with improving it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is it? "A rogue-lite action-rpg brimming with randomly generated levels, deep customization, and rich persistent progression. Battle your way through the perilous Dark Citadel, collecting powerful equipment and trinkets that unlock game-changing upgrades and abilities. This unique mix of permanent equipment in the style of action-rpgs along with run defining rewards from its rogue-lite roots results in a compelling experience where you are sure to get something new out of every run, always progressing in some way, with no two runs the same."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endgame Maps.</li>
<li>Epic Tier Armour Drops.</li>
<li>Improved Steam Deck Support.</li>
<li>French, German, Russian, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese Language Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>The tweak for the Steam Deck was small, mainly adjusting the resolution but this should now be enough to get the game bumped up from Steam Deck Playable to Steam Deck Verified. The less people have to go diving into settings to get a game to look right, the better the overall experience.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA DLSS support in progress for NVK, the open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is pretty big and exciting, the open source NVK driver for NVIDIA GPUs is on a path towards getting NVIDIA DLSS support. Announced on their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/froggi.es/post/3m36txfxcb427" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> profile by one of Valve's Linux developers, Autumn Ashton, who has previously done a fair amount of work on the likes of DXVK and VKD3D-Proton (and created D9VK).</p>
<p>Ashton mentioned how it took 3 days but they got DLSS to work on NVK noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After about 3 days of work, I got DLSS to work on NVK (the open source NVIDIA driver in Mesa)!</p>
<p>DLSS is essentially just some launched Cuda kernels, so it was just a matter of implementing the VK_NVX_binary_import and VK_NVX_image_view_handle extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With an image noted to be "(Control, 960x540 -&gt; 1920x1080)":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13825309621760519848gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13825309621760519848gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image Credit - Autumn Ashton</em></p>
<p>Further in the Bluesky thread Ashton noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These extensions are used by DXVK and VKD3D-Proton via DXVK-NVAPI to implement DLSS. Although, that alone was not an easy feat because the surface area of Cuda is pretty huge and parsing the cubins is difficult as there's these weirdly packed attributes spread across-multiple sections an ELF where some of the metadata is ordinal-based and some of it is name-based and oh, the ELF is also inside another container of ELFs (elves?).</p>
<p>But once you parse all that out, it's actually not *that* bad.</p>
<p>The surface area is mostly in the parsing of the cubins, the actual dispatch code is tiny! ATM, it only supports DLSS versions that have code compiled for the GPU you are using. If you try and run old DLSS on a new GPU, that won't work currently. PTX-&gt;NIR is much harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty great to see the NVK driver continue to make big improvements. One day perhaps the open source driver might end up being the best way for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux.</p>

      <title>SpaceCraft from Shiro Games has been delayed but a playtest is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SpaceCraft from Shiro Games is easily one of the most exciting looking upcoming games, but we're going to have to wait a bit longer to see it release.</p>
<p>What is it? SpaceCraft is an online space exploration and building game. Explore a vast galaxy of solar systems and planets, mine and craft resources, design and build ships, automate planetary bases and interplanetary logistics, trade and cooperate.</p>
<p>Their original plan for Early Access was to have it out this year, but they've now moved it to a vague Q2 2026. This is due to them wanting to get some proper player feedback on it, which they said is essential to have before a successful Early Access launch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bdd0avB3t-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875b5d7dc81828ab3e5d50db018f52a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bdd0avB3t-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the playtest they plan to start sending out invites towards the end of October, with you able to sign up via the Steam page right now. There will be no NDA, so you'll be able to capture footage and talk about it with anyone. They plan to keep on building up the playtest towards Early Access adding in more features as they go.</p>

      <title>Improved Steam Deck support is coming to Satisfactory</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Satisfactory recently had a fresh experimental Beta for testing, which includes improvements to how it works on Valve's Steam Deck. Currently the game has a Steam Deck Playable rating due to issues with the first-time setup and in-game text being small, with this update making progress towards getting it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5837267361760518551gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The EXPERIMENTAL Update v1.1.1.5 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/499459531596630667" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> from October 7th starts by noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone, Today weâre reopening experimental with several changes, but the most important one of them is an optimization weâve done a refactor of how we handle Spline Collision in-game, so now Conveyor Belts, Pipelines and Hypertubes should only have collision when a player is near them, this should also result in memory optimizations for bigger saves that use a lot of them.</p>
<p>This could potentially have unintended effects in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer/Dedicated Server so we wanted to release this in Experimental first to see if thereâs anything we need to address before these changes come to the default version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OPTIMIZATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored Spline Collision
	<ul>
<li>This affects Conveyor Belts, Pipelines and Hypertubes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUG FIXES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed âLetâs see whatâs out thereâ achievement did not work when playing in languages other than English</li>
<li>Fix for a specific crash when loading saves that contain Conveyor Belts built by blueprint auto-connect during 1.1 Experimental when it was not working correctly and have not been resaved since</li>
<li>Fixed null pointer crash when logging discrepancy between picked up items on client and server</li>
</ul>
<strong>STEAM DECK</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controller support not working with the Server Manager</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Verified support:
	<ul>
<li>First time install now properly supports Steam Deck in-built controls during the first time setup elements (Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime)</li>
<li>Steam Deck built-in controls are now always usable and available even when an External Controller is connected</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really great to see, so soon once it's in the main public build you'll be able to build on the go hopefully without issues. There's a few games on Steam that do need the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime and give you a UI for it, but they often need the touch screen or emulated mouse / keyboard controls, so nice to see another game make this easier for players on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Inspired by 80s and 90s trash-horror cinema, 3rd person action game HandFoot looks hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HandFoot is an upcoming chaotic 3rd person action game where every gun is also a melee weapon. Inspired by 80s and 90s trash-horror cinema it could be great. The whole setting, style and action in it look completely ridiculous and I really can't wait to try it.</p>
<p>More about it: "HandFoot blends grotesque action, physics-driven combat, and gritty stealth into one chaotic ride.<br/>
Shoot, smash, throw, and improvise with any weapon in your hands. When bullets arenât enough, slow time and use your surroundings to turn enemies into debris.</p>
<p>But violence isnât always the answer. Crawl through vents, climb across rooftops, and sneak through the shadows to stalk your targets or avoid detection entirely. Solve light environmental puzzles, uncover clues, and piece together the grim mystery behind the factoryâs secrets.</p>
<p>Whether you fight or hide, every move counts â and every mistake leaves a stain."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet-Time Combat:</strong> Slow down time to unleash cinematic destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Versatility:</strong> Every gun doubles as a melee weapon â shoot, smash, or throw it straight into someoneâs skull.</li>
<li><strong>Stealth &amp; Exploration:</strong> Hide, climb, crawl, and sneak through dark industrial zones and twisted environments.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Puzzles:</strong> Simple but clever challenges that reveal hidden paths and lore.</li>
<li><strong>Grindhouse Aesthetic:</strong> Inspired by 80sâ90s trash horror with over-the-top gore, grim humor, and VHS-era attitude.</li>
<li><strong>Physics-Driven Gore:</strong> Dismember enemies, blast apart bodies, and paint the walls with chaos.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam page notes Linux support as "OS: Linux + Proton", so it appears the developer is doing some sort of testing with playing it in Proton being supported.</p>

      <title>BattleBit Remastered is surprisingly alive - a huge Operation Overhaul update test arrives in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dropping the first bit of proper news on Steam since early 2024 after the release of Battlefield 6 is certainly a choice - BattleBit Remastered is still alive.</p>
<p>If you only followed the game on Steam, you might have thought it was basically dead since there had been no posts since early 2024. I thought so, and a <em>lot</em> of their fans did too. Not everyone visits an official developer website or can keep up with social media.</p>
<p>Now formally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/671860/view/498334899948749334" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam, "Operation Overhaul" is a major update with first testing of it due in November. They've been working on it for the "past year and a half" and it will have "a ton of changes to gameplay, levels, UI, QOL, balancing, graphics, and many other areas". A first teaser video for the update was actually posted to their YouTube channel back in June as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://joinbattlebit.com/visual-changes-overhaul/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> buried on their website it notes the game will add the likes of god rays, ambient occlusion, deeper shadows, increased render distance, improved fog and more. Another <a href="https://joinbattlebit.com/new-ambient-lighting/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> talks about the new and improved lighting so it's not so dark.</p>
<p>The brief teaser from June is below if you didn't see it before:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QbggSwxssFU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f343365c22659a65a621c2f544461ae1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QbggSwxssFU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Nice to see it is actually still being worked on. </em></p>
<p>It amazes me every time I see a developer just go silent and work in the background. This actively harms their reputation with it being an Early Access game. Even just posting small progress updates to the Steam page would have been better than the silence we've had for so long. Developers, you have a Steam page with a news section â <strong>use it</strong>.</p>
<p>The time between updates was so long that it was one of the games hit with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-now-warns-on-steam-pages-if-an-early-access-game-hasnt-been-updated-in-a-long-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam changes to put up a warning</a> for games in Early Access that haven't seen anything in a long time.</p>
<p>BattleBit Remastered actually works on Linux / SteamOS + Steam Deck with its Easy Anti-Cheat as noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>, so it may still be a good solution for those of you wanting large-scale warfare on Linux.</p>

      <title>That didn&#39;t last long - Blue Protocol: Star Resonance anti-cheat causing problems on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was just updated, as it seems the initial build did <em>not</em> actually have any anti-cheat enabled but now it does.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-is-out-now-and-does-work-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">worked initially</a> apart from a few videos, but an update was released 4 hours ago that currently doesn't have any public announcement from the developer. But, looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/20381043/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> we can see this update actually <em>added</em> in Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). Seems they initially just forgot to even add the anti-cheat. <em>Bit of a woops.</em></p>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) the game now doesn't seem to launch at all with Proton 9, Proton 10 or Proton Experimental. None of them work. However, curiously, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/ge-proton-10-18-brings-fixes-for-wayland-company-of-heroes-2-3-blue-protocol-star-resonance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest GE-Proton 10-20</a> does actually still get the game to launch on Desktop Linux for me. All seems fine for a while and then â crash. The game will just abruptly quit on you. So it's still problematic.</p>
<p>However, it <em>does</em> still run on Steam Deck with SteamOS (tested on my LCD Steam Deck). With Proton 9 it loaded up without issue and so far I've not seen it crash at all like it does repeatedly on Desktop. So it seems <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/blue-protocol-star-resonance-to-be-playable-on-steam-deck-but-probably-not-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our original report</a> with word from the developer is now correct about the compatibility with Desktop Linux not supported at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2786886081760444083gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2786886081760444083gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Blue Protocol: Star Resonance on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>A shame that Linux gamers have to continue to deal with the nuisance that is kernel-level anti-cheat. We can clearly see that Linux will run these games nicely but there's simply no solution in some cases <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/battlefield-6-releases-today-and-it-will-not-be-playable-on-any-linux-steamos-system/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like with Battlefield 6</a>. An ongoing problem that reduces our available multiplayer titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our anti-cheat page</a> was updated for the change in compatibility.</p>

      <title>LMDE 7 (Linux Mint Debian Edition) released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LMDE 7 (Linux Mint Debian Edition) is out now as the latest from the Mint team based directly on Debian instead of Ubuntu. It's their fallback plan if Ubuntu ever truly goes to shit, making sure Linux Mint could continue on and it's a target for various software they develop to also ensure their stuff works outside Ubuntu.</p>
<p>LMDE 7 is based on Debian 13 Trixie, which originally released back in August and comes with all the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a> from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7893527911760440642gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7893527911760440642gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - LMDE 7</p>
<p>The Linux Mint team didn't really go into any detail on any of their own changes, their release notes gave a one-liner of "Linux Mint 7 comes with updated software and brings refinements and many new features to make your desktop experience more comfortable". Helpful. Mostly, it will be the changes from Debian 13 along with all the updates they made to the Cinnamon desktop for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/linux-mint-22-2-zara-is-officially-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux Mint 22.2</a>.</p>

      <title>Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow gets a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a surprise to see, Ubisoft have revived Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow with a Steam release now available. Now you can actually complete your PC collection of the games available in the Splinter Cell Legacy Collection on Steam as this is the one that was missing (not counting Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials for PSP).</p>
<p>The second game in the series, that was originally released in 2004 and it was pretty much universally praised with high ratings across the board. Nice to see it now able to live on properly again. However, it does require Ubisoft Account / Ubisoft Connect, yes they've stuck that into a 20+ year old game.</p>
<p>At least with Proton 9 tested on Kubuntu Linux, it appears to work just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13648052431760438628gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13648052431760438628gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUSPENSEFUL TECHNOTHRILLER</p>
<p>Play as elite agent Sam Fisher and navigate through high-stakes missions across the globe, from the tense corridors of the American Embassy in East Timor to a high-speed train bound for Nice, France, as you race to thwart a global bio-terror threat.</p>
<p>CUTTING-EDGE STEALTH MECHANICS</p>
<p>Evade, outsmart, and silently neutralize enemies with advanced gadgets and weapons, signature stealth techniques, and strategic takedowns.</p>
<p>REACTIVE ENEMY AI</p>
<p>Be tactical and leverage your environment as you face intelligent foes who react to sound, movement, and light, keeping tension high and every mission unpredictable.</p>
<p>Please note: online features for this game are no longer supported. Multiplayer and co-op modes are no longer functional.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2025 is now live with a great many demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again, you've got a week to check out a bunch of games having their first or updated demos now in Steam Next Fest - October 2025.</p>
<p>Many demos will only be up for this event, but plenty will keep their demo up longer too. More demos than any one person can handle! The official trailer provided by Valve is below:</p>

      <title>One of the most promising deck-building roguelikes ever, Moonsigil Atlas gets a big demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas is by far one of the most interesting and promising upcoming games I've played in a while, taking deck-building roguelikes in a fun direction.</p>
<p>Instead of a mana or energy system, you use physical space. Each card you have creates a certain shape to activate and place down, so it's all about making use of the space that's available to piece things together. You can manipulate the shapes of each individual card as you progress and upgrade too, and eventually get some really interesting overpowered combos going thanks to bonuses for overlap and adjacency.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Azqo-cQaaPk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0541d8bfe71ca6e63c865f8fc207f248.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Azqo-cQaaPk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's all about physical space, there's no real right way to play through or build up your deck. It gives you an interesting type of freedom to experiment during a run.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the email sent to GamingOnLinux, here's some of what's included in the big demo upgrade for Steam Next Fest:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Localization - The upcoming Next Fest Demo will be fully playable in Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian (localization is currently work-in-progress and may have minor inaccuracies)</li>
<li>Second Act - A preview of the game's entire second act will be available to all players in the Demo</li>
<li>Forbidden Cards - New rare cards with powerful effects that can be acquired during a run</li>
<li>Artifacts (Items) - Rare and powerful artifacts that grant the player passive abilities that can be acquired during a run</li>
<li>A Ton of New Encounters - Shape Swapping (allows the player to swap the shape between two cards), Card Duplication, and more</li>
<li>Even Better Visuals - We've added a ton of new visual effects, flair, and QOL visual features to the game</li>
<li>Greatly Improved Tutorial - We've rebuilt the tutorial from the ground up to be interactive and spread out over the course of normal gameplay</li>
<li>Additional "Character Mastery" Unlocks - There is more content to be unlocked over time while playing the Demo</li>
<li>Steam Achievements - A selection of Steam achievements from the full game will be available in the demo.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I absolutely adore it. Definitely one you simply have to check out. The demo and full game have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown gets a first demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clearly still a work in progress but a taste of things to come, Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown now has a public demo available. <em>Your crew. Your ship. Your command.</em></p>
<p>What is it? "Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is a story-driven survival strategy game in which the fate of the iconic starship is in your hands. Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?"</p>
<p>The new demo trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Toj1LgFvoUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1fc3572ee6d82efb13b29a8f21bfecb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Toj1LgFvoUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So far in my early testing of it, the game works great in Proton 9 on Linux! However, the developer pretty clearly has a lot of work to do on this one.</p>
<p>The biggest problem for the game is the lack of voice over, there's seemingly none at all. That honestly felt a bit jarring when first going into it, with my brain trying to make up for it by hearing their voices inside my head as I read the subtitles. I think this is going to <em>really</em> work against it. Even if they can't get the original people to do it, some quality voice over would really help bring it to life.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that even though it's a licensed game, the familiar Star Trek music isn't there either. It all sounds a bit hollow and generic. A work in progress of course, so hopefully they'll improve the atmosphere as it goes on. The atmosphere is just severely lacking.</p>
<p>But, thankfully, other than that - it's about how I imagined it would be. A space strategy game blended with elements of a choose your own adventure (and plenty of resource management) with the Star Trek Voyager setting. The planet scanning and exploration side of it actually reminded me just a little of Mass Effect, with perhaps a little XCOM 2 vibes for the ship management but the rest is very much interactive fiction with you making constant choices to progress through it. I think they've done a good job on the interface though, it does feel very Voyager-like.</p>
<p>I do look forward to more of it, as I can certainly appreciate what they're going for here. As an avid Star Trek fan, I can see that there's some serious potential here but they have plenty of work to do on that atmosphere and game feel. Really, the outcome will ultimately rest on exactly what choices you're allowed to make throughout the full game and how wildly it will change things. I'm keen to see.</p>

      <title>From the creator of Sally Face, horror deckbuilding roguelike The House of Hamelin has a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enter the frightful world of The House of Hamelin and take control of Perdita, a young woman tasked with finding her missing cat, Paige. In development by Wither Studios founded in 2009 by Steve Gabry (Sally Face) and John Cobb it's a horror-themed deck-builder set in a house where ghastly creatures and ever-changing hallways make each step a horrific fight for survival.</p>
<p>More about it â build up a collection of unusual cards and use them against the creatures that stalk Perdita from the darkness. Engage in terrifying turn-based card combat where lurid abominations demonstrate shockingly intelligent strategies. Build two different card decks, a main spell deck and a more powerful, but limited-use ritual deck to crush the creatures preventing Perditaâs progress through the house. Battle the gang of gruesome foes in long, foreboding hallways, where clever use of stamina makes all the difference between survival or being caught by monsters. </p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8PcjGeVrqyg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cfd9cf158c53de01568c57eb9fa3792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8PcjGeVrqyg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Each new playthrough brings new layouts, enemies, and cards, giving Perdita frightening new encounters and challenges as she desperately battles her way to her feline friend. </p>
<p>From the press release emailed to GamingOnLinux: âThe House of Hamelin is a terrifying mix of deckbuilding gameplay and point-and-click adventure,â said Steve Gabry, founder of Wither Studios. âOur team aimed to create a combination of roguelike deck building and horrifying creatures that haunt your every move. Weâre excited to bring this fresh take on horror games to players looking for engaging gameplay and spine-chilling thrills. Plus, cats!â</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support with the demo out now.</p>

      <title>Build a living city on rails in Steel Artery: Train City Builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a steampunk fantasy world with many different races, Steel Artery: Train City Builder is an interesting looking take on a city-builder. Based on rails, your city will be constantly moving which comes with its own challenges.</p>
<p>It's not just the constant movement that makes it a challenge, Steel Artery doesnât give you direct control over citizens either. They act on their own economy-driven needsâchoosing jobs, resting, spending money, forming families, and shaping their own stories, you're just there to provide the opportunities they take.</p>
<p>More about it: "Once a symbol of the Empireâs technological dominance, the legendary Steelpolis has been revived in desperate times. As its newly appointed mayor, you must turn this colossal train into a living city, ensuring prosperity for your citizens while keeping the Empire alive."</p>
<p>Developer SoulAge23 recently announced they've partnered up with publisher Crytivo to help with it. And, the first official trailer has been released to get a good look at it:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expand a train-city wagon by wagon with unique tetris-like construction.</li>
<li>Hundreds of autonomous citizens live their own lives, choosing how to work, rest, and survive.</li>
<li>Humans, orcs, elves, and others bring unique needs and values, leading to cooperation, conflict, or even extremes.</li>
<li>Economy and logistics drive survival as every building uses or produces resources within limited space.</li>
<li>Explore new lands to gather resources and unlock expansion.</li>
<li>Detailed pixel art brings a vibrant steampunk world to life.</li>
<li>Replay every run differently, from a compact express to a massive titan with thousands aboard.</li>

      <title>A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad is certainly an appropriate name for this game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad is an upcoming release from Azimuth Studios, and you don't really need to guess what the game is about with that name. Dare I say it? I'm going to do it â Is this the souls-like of pinball games? Or perhaps it's Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy but pinball? Either way, this is sure to make you rage a bit.</p>
<p>With a demo now available on Steam ready for Steam Next Fest, you too can try out the infuriating one-button ball-basher and see if you have what it takes to make some progress in it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eZOE14v4wjw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a154f16d34312cf4b24eda1f8cdf8be1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eZOE14v4wjw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Imagine a version of Pinball 2000 that actively wanted you dead, and youâd be on the way to understanding A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad. Use one button (or even one finger!) to flip the titular Pinball until you feel the titular Mad, in this titular Game inspired by the maddening genius of Bennet Foddyâs Getting Over It. </p>
<p>Ascend a maze of bespoke flipper-powered puzzles, learning from every fumble and fall. Use timing, wits and patience. When that fails, get mad. Become a Pinball Wizard and claim your awesome gift at the summit. There are optional checkpoints for those who like their glory cheap, and unlockable themes for those who like their pinballs cat shaped (?)."</p>
<p>It has a Native Linux version for the demo and will support Linux for the release too.</p>

      <title>1998 arcade-style aircraft racer Plane Crazy gets a Championship Edition upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released in 1998, Plane Crazy from Inner Workings returns with the newer Plane Crazy Championship Edition from ZOOM Platform. At the original release it had a pretty mixed rating, partly due to the high difficulty of it. ZOOM Platform have been updating a getting refreshed releases out for a bunch of retro games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/1994-retro-shooter-the-fortress-of-dr-radiaki-gets-a-fancy-edition-re-release-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki back in May</a>.</p>
<p>See the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="65OSTVQAzQE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b7ef9411b0cf9502d56493543d77f17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/65OSTVQAzQE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New in this edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for high resolutions.</li>
<li>Modern gamepad support.</li>
<li>Additional quality of life configuration options:
	<ul>
<li>Auto-skip all intros.</li>
<li>Invertible Y-Axis when using gamepads.</li>
<li>Permanent first person cockpit view option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern system compatibility and crash fixes, ensuring the game runs smoothly on todayâs hardware and operating systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Over an email to GamingOnLinux a ZOOM Platform rep mentioned they aimed to ensure it worked smoothly on Linux via Wine / Proton and they noted: "To get technical for a bit, the last thing we were waiting for was figuring out the best way to force the native version of a dll we use that wraps the controller API to map the analog controls to modern controllers.<br/>
For Steam, we asked Valve to update Proton. It's live already via experimental and our Steam app is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/49877a230275968cfa8945cdfe8a0c9fa9fa4307" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pinned to that version</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://zoom-platform.sh" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">zoom-platform.sh</a> will just use that same fix through Proton by utilizing the UMU database to link our ID with the Steam appid."</p>

      <title>Unique RTS game Moduwar fixes the oversized cursor on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moduwar is an adaptive organic RTS where you control an alien creature, it's quite unique and looks really interesting.</p>
<p>More about it: "Moduwar is a Real-Time Strategy game that redefines the genre with its unique modular gameplay. Instead of commanding traditional units, you control the Modu, a highly adaptable native species of water-dwelling creature capable of growing, merging, and splitting their organic structures in real time. By strategically evolving different organs, you create custom units that adapt to any battle scenario."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lpMH1R5WhFA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6f24a5a9f0cf9a5a202287e6b1c5e23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lpMH1R5WhFA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It entered Early Access in June 2025, and came with a Native Linux version. However, it's taken them until <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/923100/view/529858829083477982" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 8th</a> to fix a really annoying problem with it. The Linux version had a hilariously oversized cursor, a problem I see a fair bit in Unity games. Nice to <em>finally</em> see it solved. Shame it took far too long to solve such a bug though.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Organic Modular Gameplay â Evolve a wide range of combat organs to build units tailored to your tactical needs.</li>
<li>Split &amp; Merge Mechanics â Scout with split tiles, ambush with stealth units, or recombine for heavy offense.</li>
<li>Single-Player Campaign â Lead the Modu through a story of rebellion against their oppressors on a hostile alien planet.</li>
<li>Stylized FMV-Style Cinematics: Experience Arkadiaâs story through live-action sequences with a retro-futuristic aesthetic.</li>
<li>Multiplayer Modes â Test your build against others in PvP, co-op, Survival, and Arena modes.</li>
<li>Living Ecosystem â Fight across a lush and dangerous world teeming with biomechanical life.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case you missed it: Valve also recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/proton-10-0-3-release-candidate-live-for-testing-better-windows-game-compatibility-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">put up a release candidate for Proton 10.0-3</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 13/10/25 19:05 UTC</strong>: GE-Proton 10-19 <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton10-19" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hotfix</a> was released the details are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added missing quotation in build patch script that caused patches to not apply properly (or at all.. oops)</li>
<li>Added quartz patch to allow clannad opening movie to play (untested) <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/issues/283" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#283</a></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update #2 - 14/10/25 - 10:20 UTC</strong>: and <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another hotfix</a> has been released with GE-Proton 10-20 here's all the details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOTFIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed unnecessary webview2 patch (fixes Forza Horizon 5 login never opening)</li>
<li>added workaround to allow darkwinter software region version of Girls Frontline 2: Exilium to work</li>
</ul>
<p>About webview2 patches:</p>
<p>Originally in wine 9 a stub was introduced which fixes/allows webview2 to install properly. This fixed webview2 installation for vermintide 2 as well as the Haoplay version of Girls Frontline 2: Exilium. Unfortunately the Haoplay version requires additional missing functionality in wine to work properly (it currently is still broken), so supplementary webview2 patches were added which were proposed to upstream wine for a merge request (separate from the original stub that was accepted). The additional patches were not accepted, and in addition, broke the login prompt for Forza Horizon 5. Additionally they did not help with getting the Haoplay version of Girls frontline 2: Exilium to work, therefore there is no point in keeping them.</p>
<p>As of now without the supplemental patches FH5 login and the Darkwinter Software version of Girls Frontline 2: Exilium are working. The difference between the Darkwinter Software version and the Haoplay version is only in region coverage. Darkwinter Software covers North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland, while Haoplay covers most European countries and the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic scrap their open beta and new Valve rules likely mean they have to change the name</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 Classic is an upcoming Source Engine mod based on Valve's Team Fortress 2, it was due to hold an open beta but they've had to scrap it.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/525355229451913256" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> posted October 6th they noted: "In the final stages of the review process, we were informed that an app on Steam cannot be both a Mod and a Demo at the same time. Unfortunately, this was not caught by anyone at EMINOMA or at Valve until last Saturday, after initial reviews hadn't flagged it as an issue and gave us the mistaken belief that we were clear to ship."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7296621931760114095gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Later in the announcement they mentioned some other concerns from Valve, in a heavily redacted section (as a bit of a joke). Turns out, Valve updated the rules noted on the Steamworks Documentation about shipping Source Engine Games / Mods. It now includes a section on the name of the games / mods that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Clear Communication</h4>
Your mod should have a distinct identity, and should not suggest that it was created or endorsed by Valve. This extends to all places where you talk about your mod, including its title. We may deny titles that imply a mod being an official prequel, sequel or remake of a Valve title.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Bad titles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ricochet 2</li>
<li>Ricochet Classic</li>
<li>Ricochet: Source</li>
</ul>
<strong>Better titles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deflection â A Ricochet Mod</li>
<li>Collider â A Ricochet Story</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Spotted the <a href="http://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/a72284c1e0cbe8bb86e0ff088b575e33478ea6f7#diff-6d4c839c12c1fe885be1dde8bc5d5ce52a916ea7f97888b99a6545d93e18c08a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> thanks to the work SteamDB do tracking everything. Oh wow, Ricochet 2 huh?</em></p>
<p>Overall, it seems fair enough, Valve provide a lot to developers to mess with their code in the Source SDK and so they don't want Steam customers to be confused thinking mods like this are in any way official.</p>
<p>At some point then, I expect Team Fortress 2 Classic to go through a rebrand with a newer name.</p>

      <title>Take on the role of a curious baby boar in the demo for Adorable Adventures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Adorable Adventures is a cozy third-person exploration adventure where you're Boris, a curious baby boar on a mission to find their family.</p>
<p>Covered initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/adorable-adventures-is-a-gorgeous-upcoming-adventure-featuring-a-mischievous-baby-boar/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in July</a>, I was instantly pulled in by the super cute setting and the wonderful looking visuals to match. From peaceful forest meadows to rocky highlands, dark caves and sun-dappled paths you have to use your nose to follow trails, uncover secrets, make friends and expand your library of smells.</p>
<p>Developer Wild Sheep Studio have just released the first demo, and it's as sweet as I imagined it would be. Boris is absolutely adorable, and the animations they've created for your movement are pretty great too. Watching Boris slip and slide all over the place â and the running, it's so funny. As is the sound of Boris sniffing away at all the things you get to discover.</p>
<p>A new demo trailer is also live:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a mischievous baby boar</li>
<li>A deep and innovative scent-tracking mechanic</li>
<li>An interactive herbarium to complete</li>
<li>Interact with your brothers and sisters and other wildlife</li>
<li>A collection of playful activities to compete in</li>
<li>An adaptive story told in voice-over </li>
<li>Playful blend of exploration, light platforming and discovery</li>
<li>Made with care by a small, passionate indie team</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also previously posted in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3840230/view/539991928250303008" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> about how they were testing it on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Worked great on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9. I wasn't a fan of the camera controls though, that will take a bit more getting used to with it zooming in and out along with rotating with the same stick but other than that I really need a whole lot more of this.</p>

      <title>Effulgence RPG has some of the slickest animated 3D ASCII art I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a very fun surprise, Effulgence RPG is an upcoming party-based sci-fi role-playing game rendered entirely from text symbols arranged in 3D space. It looks like nothing else I've seen before, it really is quite impressively made.</p>
<p>A demo is live ready for Steam Next Fest, so you can try it out and see for yourself just how cool it is. A fun idea for a game visual style but the gameplay mechanics are interesting too. In Effulgence RPG, enemies are more than obstacles - they're also raw materials you need. Destroying them breaks them down into particles allowing you to forge weapons and gear using a signature matter printer system, all while exploring a world built from shimmering text characters for a unique, high-contrast 3D ASCII visual identity.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XQc9Rt-F0oI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d27e93b476b47afbd09ddb020f67cffb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XQc9Rt-F0oI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the press email they noted: "Effulgence RPG runs great on Steam Deck via Proton, with a controller-first UI, readable 3D ASCII rendering on the handheld display, and no platform-specific blockers. That same Proton compatibility also means the game runs on Linux desktops (e.g., Steam on Ubuntu/Arch) with gamepad, mouse, or keyboard. We welcome Linux coverage and feedback from Deck users."</p>
<p>Nice to see! And I can confirm it works beautifully on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9.</p>
<p>Definitely a demo you need to try.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder and dungeon crawler Into The Grid arrives November 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid from Flatline Studios is an incredibly promising blend of a cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder and dungeon crawler and it's arriving November 10th. Featuring full Native Linux support, with a demo still live right now for you to try.</p>
<p>Set in a Cyberpunk world in the year 2112, the game mixes strategic and immersive card battles with tactical map exploration and resource management. Become a master hacker, make your way to the Mainframe buried deep within the Grid, and access the corporation's dirtiest secrets.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DmT2jYhE114"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6945a1ad68a5a58ad6d31e8a74d394c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DmT2jYhE114" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really love the style in this one, especially the way enemies are animated during the battles. Really helps sell the whole cyberpunk thing. Looking forward to the release of this one, although this is only the beginning. The story and lore is a work in progress since it will be in Early Access, which they estimate will last at least one year. During Early Access they plan to add two more characters, new cards, new enemies and so on.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exciting blend of Deckbuilding, Card Battler and Dungeon Crawler - </strong>Ever wondered what the love child of a Roguelike Deckbuilder and a Tabletop Boardgame would look like? Hereâs the answer: <em>Into The Grid</em> features action-packed card battles and deeply tactical map exploration with resource management.</li>
<li><strong>Death to dead draws</strong> - <em>Into The Grid</em> has a unique dual-resource system where each card is played for its effect while simultaneously generating Virtual Memory (VIM), which allows the player to take advantage of even the most suboptimal hands. Use VIM to activate your Commands during battle and obliterate your enemiesâ defences!</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the Commands</strong> - Commands are powerful unlockable skills that can be the difference between victory and defeat. Choose them wisely, sync them with your deck, and strategically deploy them for knockout wins.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Dungeon Crawler-like navigation</strong> - The Grid is the infinite digital landscape where information lives. Full of riches and dangers, itâs a place where only the sharpest minds can thrive. Experience a layer of depth never seen before in the genre; consider every move as if it were your last... because it might be. Fight or flee? Visit this area now or later? Cash in a reward immediately, or hold on to it for an even bigger payoff? The choice is yours, as well as the punishment and the profit.</li>
<li><strong>Unveil the stories behind the Hackers</strong>- <em>Into The Grid</em> will include four* distinct characters, each with their own story arc, gameplay mechanics, art, and much more. Every playable hacker belongs to a different Faction that determines the hackerâs ethos and their reasons to be outlaws.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Around 70,000 users affected in Discord related breach which includes some government ID images</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. This whole ongoing online safety thing is going well isn't it? Who could have guessed that some personal data would end up leaking? Everyone with a brain that even remotely understands the internet and technology.</p>
<p>Discord recently <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on October 3rd that a partner they were using for third-party customer service had been compromised. The attackers managed to swipe the likes of contact details, limited billing info, IP addresses, messages with customer service agents, limited corporate data and a "small number of governmentâID images".</p>
<p>Originally the article did not name the company involved, or how many were affected, but it was updated on October 9th to clarify after some misinformation spread online and named "5CA" as the company that was compromised. That and they also now note more clearly that "approximately 70,000" had their government ID photos exposed".</p>
<p>This is all to do with Discord's requirement to verify the age of people in some countries, but this is specifically to do with those who went through customer service for age-related appeals. So to be clear, Discord itself was <em>not</em> compromised, the third-party 5CA were the issue.</p>
<p>A thoroughly frustrating issue. One not just localised to the UK with the Online Safety Act, as more countries and US states have been slowly pushing out age verification requirements to various platforms. This issue of security and privacy is only going to get worse as time goes on. These laws have just added an extra burden to everyone, and made an even bigger target for bad actors to grab even more sensitive personal data from people.</p>

      <title>Battlefield 6 releases today and it will not be playable on any Linux / SteamOS system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a reminder that thanks to EA's latest anti-cheat, the launch of Battlefield 6 today will be unplayable on any Linux system. This is because of EA Javelin anticheat, which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously just called EA anticheat before being rebranded</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's the same for the likes of the recent release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/full-circle-ea-confirm-again-that-skate-will-not-support-linux-steam-deck-or-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">skate.</a>, various other Battlefield titles, EA Sports FC, EA Sports Madden, EA Sports WRC and any other modern game that has an online mode from EA will remain unplayable thanks to EA Javelin anticheat. As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed on our dedicated ant-cheat page</a>, there's simply no workaround for it and no solution until the day Linux / SteamOS gain enough market share that it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18053512911760092469gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Battlefield 6</em></p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-battlefield-3-and-battlefield-4-online-working-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 working though with our guide</a>, since they use older tech. We also have a dedicated ongoing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/alternatives-to-popular-games-that-dont-work-on-linux-steam-deck-and-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide of game alternatives for Linux platforms</a> that might help.</p>
<p>Another alternative is NVIDIA GeForce NOW, which can be played in the browser on Linux (lower quality) and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a dedicated Steam Deck application</a>. NVIDIA recently <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-battlefield-6/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> GeForce NOW is ready for Battlefield 6 and it will have the newer GeForce RTX 5080 servers compatibility too for even better quality overall.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day we might see Valve introduce a newer and more improved anti-cheat themselves with full Linux support, that could end up being another solution. Although, it would need to be cross-platform for it to pull in more developers too.</p>

      <title>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is out now and does work on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/blue-protocol-star-resonance-to-be-playable-on-steam-deck-but-probably-not-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the previous report</a> that it likely wouldn't work on Desktop Linux, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is out now and does work. Now you too can enjoy the anime gacha on your preferred platform be it Desktop Linux or Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>It's supposedly using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), but it's <em>not</em> actually listed on the Steam page, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as per Valve's rules it's supposed to be</a>. Currently this is a little unclear on what exactly it's using since there's no proper statement now from the developer. Either way, it works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8051602021760091579gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8051602021760091579gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, there are some issues so it's not completely playable yet.</p>
<p>A bunch of the videos don't play by default in Proton, and you just get a black screen. I've tried Proton 9, Experimental and the latest GE-Proton and they all have the same issue. They're somewhat minor with the videos for picking a class and area introductions but it still detracts from the experience. Aside from that, everything else does appear to work and quite nicely too.</p>

<p>If you do plan to try it and want to give feedback, they're currently only looking for issues that broke between Proton 10.0-2 and 10.0-3.</p>
<p>How to try it? You need to have Proton 10 installed in your Steam Library, and then opt into the Beta on Proton 10.</p>

      <title>Retro Brazilian RTS game Outlive returns with Outlive 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Outlive 25 is a remaster of the classic 2000 RTS game rebuilt by the original developers, and a demo is just about to drop too.</p>
<p>I truly love base-building RTS games, so this is going high up on my list as I had honestly never heard of it until the news dropped into the GamingOnLinux inbox. Then again, I was only 12 when it originally released (and probably busy playing Total Annihilation). This is why I love remasters, bringing a new audience to games like this for fans of the genre.</p>
<p>In the full game you choose between Humans or Robots, while you decide the fate of the earth across three story campaigns. A future where machines have risen to wage war against their creators and natural resources are scarce.  Hmm, sounds familiar doesn't it.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tqms5Lo-qS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d09848bd4fc44880b5ae4c9000a3a50.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tqms5Lo-qS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Tree:</strong> Upgrade your units and make your buildings more efficient during matches, making each battle unique.</li>
<li><strong>Espionage &amp; Counterespionage:</strong> Scout enemy bases, intercept incoming missiles, and carry out other covert actions.</li>
<li><strong>Pathing System: </strong>Automate unit behaviors so you can focus entirely on your strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Forge alliances with other armies to take down your opponents.</li>
<li><strong>Online Multiplayer: </strong>Play against other players to claim the top spot as the ultimate war strategist!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>âOutlive was among the first Brazilian games to gain global recognition and success, yet itâs not been easily accessible for several years as technology has advanced in the past quarter century,â said Rodrigo DalâAsta, co-founder of Continuum Entertainment. âThat said, we didnât simply want to port the original Outlive to modern hardware, as there was so much potential for improvement. We plan to add ranking boards, even more customization options, and enhanced presentation. Outlive 25 takes everything that was great about retro RTS games and infuses it with a jolt of contemporary polish and accessibility for the ultimate fusion of old and new!â </p>
<p>A demo will be live tomorrow, October 10th, so it's ready for Steam Next Fest. Interestingly, the demo is its own standalone thing. The demo itself is a remake of the original demo, with a standalone campaign that serves as a prologue to the events of the three main campaigns. Pretty fun idea.</p>

      <title>Intel details Panther Lake architecture expected to start shipping January 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel have now revealed a whole lot more on Panther Lake, their next-generation chip architecture with RibbonFET and PowerVia.</p>
<p>Using their new Intel 18A 2-nanometer class node they said it delivers "up to 15% better performance per watt and 30% improved chip density compared to Intel 3.5". The big new changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>RibbonFET:</strong> Intelâs first new transistor architecture in over a decade, enabling greater scaling and more efficient switching for improved performance and energy efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>PowerVia:</strong> A groundbreaking backside power delivery system, enhancing power flow and signal delivery.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned Foveros, their advanced packaging and 3D chip stacking technology that "enables the stacking and integration of multiple chiplets into advanced SoC designs, delivering flexibility, scalability and performance at the system level". Intel 18A will form the foundation for three upcoming generations of products both client (like gamers) and servers.</p>
<p>From the press release, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra series 3 processors will be the first client chips built on Intel 18A, which should see "broad market availability starting January 2026".</p>
<p>Some highlights they included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lunar Lake-level power efficiency and Arrow Lake-class performance.</li>
<li>Up to 16 new performance-cores (P-cores) and efficient-cores (E-cores) delivering more than 50% faster CPU performance vs. previous generation.</li>
<li>New Intel Arc GPU with up to 12 Xe cores delivering more than 50% faster graphics performance vs. previous generation.</li>
<li>Balanced XPU design for next-level AI acceleration with up to 180 Platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be especially interesting with the new Xe3 GPU architecture, and with the overall efficiency perhaps we might see more Intel gaming handheld PCs as they look to take back the market from AMD.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Intel Panther Lake held with a white glove" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6373071051760016817gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Intel Panther Lake</em></p>
<p>We'll have to wait until closer to January for when they actually reveal the list of processors coming, which as far as I can see they haven't done so yet, this announcement was much more about all the tech behind it and not specific models of anything. It's all about being more modular, allowing for them to scale it better across different industries.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7106354361760017183gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Intel Panther Lake configurations table across 8 and 16 core configs" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7106354361760017183gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>XeSS 3 with multi-frame generation was also revealed, to compete with NVIDIA DLSS more. So future Intel GPUs will see a nice performance boost, and it should be supported on their older Intel Arc GPUs too. Games that support XeSS 2 will also support XeSS 3 when it launches.</p>

      <title>Physics-based delivery adventure Truckful gets a first demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer MythicOwl and Pocketpair Publishing (Palworld), Truckful is a wacky and mysterious physics-based delivery adventure. Just today they released the first demo for you to try (Native Linux) and it has a brand new demo trailer too giving you more of a look at the game.</p>
<p>You'll be tasked with taking your reliable old truck to deliver a range of goods across the countryside. You'll be dealing with various challenging tasks during your deliveries, and there's something a little strange going on. From the developer's description they note the "seemingly idyllic countryside hides its fair share of mysteries" and that the "ancient forest on the outskirts whispers through local legends and folklore, its dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadowsâ¦". Sounds like it might get a little spooky.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for the physics-driven co-op action-RPG Cloudheim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from Noodle Cat Games, Cloudheim is shaping up to be an impressive physics-driven co-op action-RPG.</p>
<p>What is it? A rather vibrant action-RPG built for co-op chaos and based around creative physics-based combat. You can play solo or with up to 4 total players online. It has a destructible world, which makes the combat in it quite explosive and fun with you able to tear down pillars on top of enemies, throw them into tornadoes or just kick an exploding barrel their way.</p>
<p>The fresh Cloudheim demo offers access to the game's tutorial, your airborne base of operations (Odin Shell, which is literally the back of a flying turtle), and Acts I &amp; II of the story. This includes most of the island of Arcadia and the first few dungeons. Seems like quite a generous amount of content for the demo.</p>
<p>A new trailer has also been launched for the demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fZd4mntX5XI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76902f6fdb37bee3d6639ca1aef4205e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fZd4mntX5XI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Physics-Driven Combat: Lasso, launch, and juggle enemies into fire pits, each other, or the sceneryâanything goes. Longer air time = more damage.</li>
<li>Real-Time Crafting &amp; Fusion: Grab and toss materials directly into crafting stations in the world. No menus, no inventory clutterâjust pure, visible teamwork.</li>
<li>Drop-In 4-Player Co-Op: Tame creatures, fight bosses, and explore mythic dungeons with friends. All loot is shared; your progression is not.</li>
<li>Evolving Base &amp; Shop System: Return from adventures to upgrade your base, sell loot, and unlock new features.</li>
<li>Stylized Fantasy World: Built by a team of experienced artists, Cloudheim is rich with visual flair, character, and discovery.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: "Cloudheim is a game all about physics-systems combining in unexpected ways as teams of differently built characters combine their powers in hectic battles," said David Hunt, CEO and Founder of Noodle Cat Games. "Itâs like Smash Bros. had a baby with Zelda, as you explore a sprawling fantasy kingdom full of danger, wonder, and surprises around every corner! This demo will give players a taste of the exciting adventures that await them when Cloudheim launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S"</p>
<p>It should work nicely with the latest Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>However, just to be clear they do make use of generative AI in the production of the game. As noted on the Steam page down at the bottom it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.</p>

      <title>HELLREAPER from the devs of Fury Unleashed looks incredible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the studio that gave us Fury Unleashed and Yet Another Zombie Survivors, their next game is a dark action roguelike HELLREAPER and it looks amazing.</p>
<p>The details they shared: "HELLREAPER is a roguelite action-platformer where you play as a former angel, sacrificed and reborn as the Hellreaper, a mystical executioner bound to eternal combat against the legions of the damned. Traverse shifting infernal realms, master cursed powers, and battle grotesque abominations in a desperate fight against eternal damnation.</p>
<p>Balance is at risk; Heaven must strike back, and you're their last line of defense to restore order.

      <title>WinBoat for containerised Windows apps on Linux adds custom install path, home folder sharing and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WinBoat is a very interesting tool in development to run Windows apps on Linux in a full containerised environment and it just got even better. Covered on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/winboat-is-a-new-linux-app-to-run-windows-apps-with-seamless-integration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in early September</a>, it can really help for those few apps you can't be without.</p>
<p>As a reminder on how it works - instead of using Wine / Proton, WinBoat uses an actual copy of Windows to run the apps in a special environment and helps do all the configuration for you. It's pretty slick! Some really impressive work has been going into this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18992659281760001507gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18992659281760001507gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4346116811760001508gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4346116811760001508gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developer released a few new versions since last covering it, some highlights of what's been added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom install path.</li>
<li>The ability to share your /home folder.</li>
<li>It will remember where it was when you close the app.</li>
<li>Multi-monitor support with MultiMon.</li>
<li>An option to auto-start a container.</li>
<li>A warning on disk space if you're getting full.</li>
<li>Some improvements to the general flow and user help for the app itself.</li>
<li>Added noVNC as a preset app if you want to access WinBoat from the browser.</li>
<li>Experimental Dynamic USB pass-through.</li>
<li>And lots more improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar in idea to WinApps but as the developer says in comparison:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there's no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There's a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.<br/>
<br/>
WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. No need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.</p>

      <title>Jump back into Winnieâs Hole with a fresh and expanded demo for this unique genre-blending roguelite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh bother! The virus has returned in the refreshed and expanded demo for the roguelite Winnieâs Hole the viral dungeon crawling roguelite. Yes, it's a name you can make many crude jokes about but I'll try not to.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? You control a virus inside poor Winnie. Explore cells and influence Winnie's adventure as you spread a virus through his randomly generated innards. And, enter Winnie's brain for combo-driven combat and watch as Winnie mutates over time into something horrific. It's definitely different, I'll give 'em that. </p>
<p>There's a new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bZvNefMjHwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b5bf44ba02578017c9b4ab866cae890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bZvNefMjHwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the upgraded demo they've included new mutations and perks, level generation improvements, an overhaul of the progression, controller support, improved visuals and much more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Evolve with each run - Unlock new Perks, Mutations and Virus Strains.</li>
<li>Mutate your host as a symbiotic virus.</li>
<li>Bodybuilding in the worst way.</li>
<li>A storybook narrative which reimagines Winnie in a world of dark science.</li>
<li>A fresh take on exploration, replacing the typical roguelite node map with strategic, turn-based building using a set of tetromino-like virus blocks which you can evolve and reshape.</li>
<li>Dynamic battle system where each turn is an action combo for fast-paced gameplay.</li>
<li>Holesome horror comedy with gritty art inspired by old school Nickelodeon and Brothers' Grimm fairytales.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/play-as-a-virus-inside-winnie-the-pooh-in-winnies-hole-demo-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I was quite impressed</a> with the previous version of the demo, so I look forward to getting back into Winnie's Hole.</p>

      <title>UK gov has &#34;no plans to intervene&#34; with payment processors pressuring stores to remove games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the ongoing drama from the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/game-store-itch-io-has-deindexed-adult-content-due-to-payment-processor-scrutiny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a> getting hit by payment processors for hosting certain adult games, the UK government say pretty clearly they will not get involved.</p>
<p>In the UK we have a dedicated government petitions website, where any UK citizen can ask the government to do something. When a petition hits at least 10,000 verified signatures, the government has to respond. If it hits 100,000 then it gets considered for a debate in parliament.</p>
<p>There's an <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/734441" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ongoing petition</a> titled "Ban payment processors stopping services based on objections to legal content", which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are reports that payment processing companies have recently placed pressure on companies that rely on their services, pressuring them to remove legitimate content.</p>
<p>Because there are a small number of major payment processing companies, we believe this poses an unacceptable threat to small businesses and private individuals, and undermines democratic free speech through censorship from unaccountable companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point recently that petition managed to reach over the 10K threshold (12,362 at time of writing), and so the UK government responded on October 6th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government recognises the important role payments plays in supporting a resilient, diverse and growing economy. The Government is committed to ensuring that the UKâs payment system works for all, allowing businesses and customers to transact with confidence.</p>
<p>The Government recognises that it is important for businesses to have greater choice in the forms of payment that they can accept. The National Payments Vision, published in November 2024, set out the Governmentâs ambition for a world-leading payments ecosystem, where consumers and businesses have a choice of payment methods to meet their needs. A key part of this ambition is the continued development of Open Banking, which enables consumers to make purchases using a wider range of payment methods, including account-to-account payments, thereby increasing competition in the payments sector. HM Treasury is working closely with the financial services regulators to deliver these outcomes.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding which businesses payment processors contract with are a commercial matter, taking into account the relevant requirements on the firm. These decisions will be influenced by a variety of factors, and the Government has no plans to intervene in those commercial decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petition ends 26th February, 2026.</p>
<p>Seems there's going to be no easy solution to this, aside from finding some alternative payment processors that won't kick up a fuss about certain adult content. Complaining directly to the payment processors might help too.</p>

<p>From the press release: "All Under Heaven fulfils one of our great ambitions," says Crusader Kings III Game Director Alexander Oltner. "We've always seen Crusader Kings as the story of the entire medieval world, and you can't fully tell that story without East Asia. This vision for the series predates my leadership, and it is exciting to bring it to fruition. This is the largest expansion in Crusader Kings history, and that posed a lot of new challenges for us. We hope that our players find a lot to learn and love in All Under Heaven."</p>
<p>Hopefully it will do better than the recent expansions to Stellaris, which all have pretty mixed ratings. The last DLC for Crusader Kings III with Coronations also has a Overwhelmingly Negative rating, and the previous DLC with Khans of the Steppe is also on Mixed. Paradox just don't seem to be hitting the mark at all lately.</p>

      <title>Zelda fused with GTA vibes? Vice: Magic City Mayhem certainly sounds unique</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vice: Magic City Mayhem is a supremely odd blend but it looks like it works. A Zelda-like with some GTA elements thrown in because why not.</p>
<p>More about it: Vice: Magic City Mayhem is a top-down 8-bit retro action/adventure game inspired by Zelda with a GTA: Vice City theme. You play as Dutch, one of Magic Cityâs top enforcers on a quest to save your one true love, Sophie. Make your way through bustling nightclubs, scenic beaches, and raptor-infested yachts to defeat 8 epic bosses and uncover the secrets of Magic City and save your one true love. At least it's a retro Zelda-like that's aiming to be just a <em>bit</em> different.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B-5ffMNhhjw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cda690b7320c5f9c8e53ab9249fc999a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B-5ffMNhhjw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on the Steam page (works with Proton 9) and they have a crowdfunding campaign going on right now. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jurassicsunsetgames/vice-magic-city-mayhem-a-zelda-like-fused-with-gta-vibes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> for it lasts until October 30th with their team hoping to hit at least $10,000. At time of writing it has just about $7,000 pledged. It's only a small goal, as the game is about 80% complete according to the developer.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore &amp; Discover: Secrets, treasures, and lore across six unique environments.</li>
<li>Challenging Dungeons: Solve intricate puzzles and traps in eight distinct dungeons.</li>
<li>Dynamic Combat: Use a katana, magical items, and ranged weapons to defeat enemies.</li>
<li>Epic Boss Battles: Confront eight unique district rulers with bold personalities.</li>
<li>Retro Vibes: 80s-inspired visuals and a chiptune soundtrack for a nostalgic feel.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Co-op puzzler PICO PARK: Classic Edition is now permanently free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to a bit of a woops, PICO PARK:Classic Edition from TECOPARK is now staying free to play, permanently.</p>
<p>What is it? PICO PARK:Classic Edition is a local/online multiplayer action puzzle platformer game for 2-10 players. Originally released in 2016 it had a big upgrade in September 2025 to refresh the visuals, add online play, add Steam Input support and add support for monitors running at 60Hz or higher.</p>
<p>It was paid before, then temporarily made free during 2021 and then back to a paid game. This time was only supposed to be free for about a week but it has to stick now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14649789471759925812gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/461040/view/527607029268743823" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said: "I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support. but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! :) If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (PICO PARK , PICO PARK 2) too". They also mentioned in a <a href="https://x.com/teco_park/status/1974686893934870679" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (translated) that Steam told them they could not make it paid again due to going free multiple times.</p>
<p>So now it's basically a nice intro game to the full PICO PARK and PICO PARK 2, both of which have an overall Very Positive rating on Steam. Great co-op fun if you're in need of another to add to your list.</p>

      <title>System Shock 2 (1999) is getting delisted and bundled with the 25th Anniversary Remaster</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios / Atari have announced that the classic System Shock 2 (1999) is getting delisted from stores on October 10th. This means you won't be able to buy it, but existing purchases will remain so you can still download and play it.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news though, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/238210/view/503964319779651936" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam noted it's going to be bundled with the newer System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. Although, the remaster is a fair bit pricier at Â£23.99 compared with Â£6.99 for the original.</p>
<p>One interesting point about this is that it's part of the GOG Preservation Program, and so far GOG don't seem to have announced a change for their store but it's likely it will happen at some point. GOG did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/blizzard-are-delisting-warcraft-i-and-ii-from-gog-so-gog-adds-a-special-discount-and-will-keep-them-updated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announce late last year</a> when Warcraft I and II were removed that they've extended their compatibility promise to keep delisted games updated as well. In this case though it shouldn't matter too much especially if GOG gets them bundled together, it's at least not being completely removed like we've seen with other games in the past.</p>

      <title>The cross-platform Nexus Mods app brings a fancy new mod downloads page</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer in-development cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app has improved again, bringing with it a proper built-in downloads page.</p>
<p>With this, it makes it much easier to download mods directly from the Nexus Mods website and manage the downloads across different games. Allowing you to pause, resume or cancel mod downloads. A necessary step towards supporting bigger mods for some of the bigger games.</p>
<p>You can also now make an editable copy of a Nexus Mods Collection, there's a new early version of a Conflict Viewer to ensure you have mods that work properly together and a few bug fixes too.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8272985671759917049gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8272985671759917049gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the app has full support for Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk, with work ongoing towards Baldur's Gate 3, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, Skyrim and Fallout 4. Really keen to see this app expand to make modding easier on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>PowerWash Simulator 2 release date confirmed for October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get your rubber gloves on again, as PowerWash Simulator 2 is going to officially arrive later this month with a discount if you have the original.</p>
<p>A game that likely needs no introduction. The name alone gives it away, and the original was pretty popular. It's all about making various locations squeaky clean. This time you'll be able to do it with friends in split-screen co-op in addition to online play.<em> Even though you should probably be cleaning your own house right?</em></p>
<p>Developer FuturLab confirmed it arrives on October 23rd priced at $24.99 / â¬24.99 / Â£19.99 / JPÂ¥2970. You'll get a 15% launch discount if you own the original PowerWash Simulator.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also provided you can watch below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RrFexXPbVuM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2138e21b6dcaec4d8accc114876f148b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RrFexXPbVuM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Split-Screen &amp; Online Multiplayer</strong> â Clean solo, with a friend on the couch, or with up to four players online â all with shared progression.</li>
<li><strong>Abseiling &amp; Scissor Lift</strong> â Scale buildings, hover over rooftops, and clean from every angle. Donât worry â fall damage doesnât exist here.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Stage Jobs</strong> â Just when you think youâve finished, surprise: thereâs more to clean. Some jobs expand mid-wash, unlocking new areas on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Home Base Customisation</strong> â Restore furniture, decorate your HQ, and keep your base clean(ish). You earned it.</li>
<li><strong>Career Mode</strong> â Take on 38 jobs across increasingly strange, sprawling, and oddly satisfying locations.</li>
<li><strong>Soap, Nozzles &amp; Tools</strong> â Upgrade your washer loadout with adaptable nozzles, surface cleaners, and yes, foamy soap.</li>
<li><strong>Cat Companions</strong> â Ulysses and her kittens are back, following you on jobs and expecting to be petted. Often.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a demo available which appeared to work quite nicely with Proton on Linux.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors online co-op due out before the end of the year and more announcements are coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer poncle has confirmed that Vampire Survivors much anticipated online co-op update will fully release before the end of the year.</p>
<p>On their official <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vampire.poncle.games/post/3m2m6unial32o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> account they said "Online co-op is coming to Vampire Survivors on PC and consoles THIS Autumn! (yeah it's autumn right now shh)" and with Autumn ending December 21st - it won't be too long to wait. And on PC you can already try it out in the opt-in Beta on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/vampire-survivors-latest-beta-adds-online-play-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as covered on GamingOnLinux</a> at the end of August.</p>
<p>They're also teasing more announcements of extra features are to come and said to stay tuned for next week. They also gave the online mode its own trailer, which makes a joke of the "add online button" some developers make about how some gamers expect adding online play to be easy.</p>

      <title>Dying Breed could end up being a real gem for RTS fans - once it&#39;s a bit further along</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome back, commander. Dying Breed is a new retro-inspired real time strategy game from Sarnayer / MicroProse Software out now in Early Access.</p>
<p>Set in a timeline where during World War 2 a whole lot of nukes were fired making the northern part of the world uninhabitable, a new war is brewing â and something about mutants? All hell is about to break loose. Dying Breed is very much inspired by the classic Command &amp; Conquer / Red Alert series from Westwood (now EA), complete with a FMV (Full-motion video) intro along with FMV mission briefings, and it features two completely different story campaigns to play through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5655413051759841873gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5655413051759841873gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Neither the publisher nor their separate press team replied to a key request from GamingOnLinux, so I went ahead of picked up a personal copy as for me it was too good to pass up. I adore these types of classic base-building strategy games, since I grew up playing the likes of Command &amp; Conquer (amongst many others at the time). Additionally, it seems shortly before release the mentions of Linux and macOS support were actually silently <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2088550/history/?changeid=31349635" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">removed</a> - so you'll need Proton to play it on Linux systems. (<strong>Update</strong>: their PR team sent a key over right after this was published)</p>
<p>My initial thought is that it's like playing a weird mirror-universe version of the classics. The FMV cut-scenes are incredibly cheesy, to the point they're actually a little on the charming side. They're campy and stupid but anyone who likes the classic will probably appreciate them as I did. They've also sprinkled in some short animated scenes too, although they're a fair bit on the rough side they still nicely add to the experience, and in fact reminded me a little of the animated scenes between missions in the 1997 RTS game Dark Colony. With a little flavour of the 1997 RTS game KKND for the mutant side of things too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/762287111759841871gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/762287111759841871gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Taking all the elements together, it's a clear labour of love for classic games from the developer pulling in elements from many different strategy games into a strange but inviting RTS. Very challenging though, some of the missions can feel a little bit too punishing even early on. Seems like the missions are nice and varied though, so it's an interesting challenge but it clearly needs some balancing for the first few missions at the very least to ease players in a bit more.</p>
<p>The pathfinding seriously needs some big improvements though, units get stuck quite often on everything which is quite a nuisance and often just decide to walk across the ore you're gathering (which kills you) instead of walking around it. Fixing up the pathfinding should probably be the first thing they fix up during Early Access as it really harms the experience here. Unit movement overall just needs to be smarter, like medics running out constantly in front of the rest of your group - but then I assume you're supposed to use control groups to manage the separate infantry types on a micro-management level. <em>That certainly would be more like the classic C&amp;C games.</em></p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access and not finished, I'll refrain from giving any true opinion on it, but thankfully for now it does appear to work very nicely with Proton 9.0-4 tested on Kubuntu 25.04. No issues at all in terms of stability or Linux-specific bugs so far.</p>
<p>In the current version it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 playable factions, each with unique units and structures.</li>
<li>22 story missions (38 maps total).</li>
<li>43 FMV and 3D videos (25 minutes of cinematics, including intro).</li>
<li>70+ units and 58 structures, from fortifications to hero units.</li>
<li>23 live actors, 75 3D models, 19 original music tracks (83 minutes total), and 1000+ voice lines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a clear <a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//43693320/758c9881f7786dca23e338d74cb859c805c2c41b.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> on what's planned to come to the game including 12 new missions, modding support, performance improvements, an AI overhaul and more.</p>
<p>Very keen to see more from it as it continues through Early Access.</p>

      <title>CloverPit hits the jackpot on Steam grabbing 500,000 sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/megabonk-is-a-mega-success-selling-1-million-in-2-weeks-after-being-repeatedly-told-to-delay-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Megabonk being a success</a>, we have another good one here with CloverPit managing to be quite the hit on Steam. <em>A horrific fusion of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11770754381759837873gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Announced on their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/panikarcade.bsky.social/post/3m2ezsk5owj2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the developers said it's hit 500,000 sales in only 8 days since the launch. Made by a small team too, although with publishing help from Future Friends Games, it goes to show that anything can happen but success is still never a guarantee.</p>
<p>In the case of CloverPit, they did manage to hook in some big YouTubers like Blitz, RTGame, Northernlion and more I've never heard of before with multiple millions of followers that covered it. Not a really big surprise though, considering the gambling theme of the game it was bound to be a hit for people doing videos on it. Goes to show that YouTube is still a huge driver of sales for game developers. Developer Panik Arcade has clearly hit their own jackpot here.</p>
<p>Nice to see some more smaller developers keep hitting gold.</p>
<p>You can see some of my own thoughts on it in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/pull-the-lever-to-gamble-and-break-the-machine-in-cloverpit-a-slot-machine-with-horror-vibes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>. The game works great on Linux Desktop PCs with Proton and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Tears of Metal is pretty much a co-op Scottish Dynasty Warriors with fun upgrades and a demo worth trying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A roguelike Scottish Dynasty Warriors? Sort of. Tears of Metal has a demo out now on Steam and if you love a good hack and slash, this is one to try out. Developed by Paper Cult, who previously released Bloodroots back in 2021. </p>
<p>Tears of Metal is a medieval hack-and-slash co-op roguelike. Carve through hordes of enemies to reclaim your island with the help of your formidable Scottish battalion. As you advance deeper into the trenches, uncover more about the mysterious Dragon Meteor and the treacherous enemy invasion. You go through slaying hordes of enemies using various different types of attacks and specials, and once each battle is completed you'll be able to pick a special upgrade to buff up your character.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5621696531759836778gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's all about the replay value here. Each run through will be different, giving you a chance to try out all sorts of powerful builds. Not just for you though, you have your own little army of Scottish soldiers who you can upgrade and improve throughout your campaign too. And, between campaigns, there's also a little settlement you can upgrade to access shops and permanent upgrades.</p>
<p>You can even play it in online co-op for up to 4 players, so looks like another one to add to our growing list of fun co-op games.</p>
<p>The game works great on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton and it should work quite well on Steam Deck too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kdt4o55qMG0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/501cf4283716c2ccdeafe3a5d2cd0089.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kdt4o55qMG0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo was refreshed for the upcoming Steam Next Fest giving you these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>March through the first act, culminating in a clash with Gilles the Hog.</li>
<li>Fight solo or side-by-side in 4-player co-op.</li>
<li>Harness power from 4 clans of Emblems (more await in the full campaign).</li>
<li>Unlock 30+ Charms earned through challenges.</li>
<li>Strengthen your army and hero with weapons, trinkets, skins, and more.</li>
<li>Brave the Challenge System for higher difficulty and replayability.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Death Road to Canada gets a major free update with new game modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>9 years after the original release, Death Road to Canada is still going with a major update released with fun new game modes. The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>What is it? Built to be replayed. It's a randomly generated road trip simulator, set in a zombie apocalypse. You build up a team of survivors to explore cities and face big swarms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5180991171759835470gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>With the QUADRICEPS update now live it adds in these game modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>INFECTION
	<ul>
<li>Time is ticking until you all turn into zombies. Every zombie you kill increases the timer, but only once you leave the mission to rest!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEVERE WEATHER MODE
	<ul>
<li>Less zombies, but now it's you versus the elements. New, dangerous weather patterns. And all this inclement weather makes everyone more hungry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RPG Mode
	<ul>
<li>Classes and powerups, in my Death Road? TRIPLE the zombies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4 Jerks SCEPTER Mode
	<ul>
<li>Start with 4 people, all with strange new powers. ALSO TRIPLE the zombies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more than just that though. There's also multiple new locations, new special characters, new weapons, new hats, new perks and various bug fixes.</p>
<p>In regards to the future of the game, even though they're working on their next game, Death Road to Canada is still going to get even more big updates. They're "about halfway done" with the next update and it sounds like even more gameplay modes will be added.</p>

      <title>Megabonk is a mega success selling 1 million in 2 weeks, after being repeatedly told to delay it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though they were told constantly to delay the release, developer vedinad who made Megabonk has clearly cut through the noise with it now a mega success. <em>I really love it, you can see some thoughts in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/megabonk-is-risk-of-rain-2-fused-with-vampire-survivors-and-its-glorious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</em></p>
<p>Just as the game was releasing the developer put up a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QehSvrRwvPY" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> to note how "Everyone has been warning me not to release my game today. Because my game launches in the middle of other massive games." (with the video showing the likes of Hades II, Silksong and Borderlands 4). The developer continues to say "Basically, I have to delay my game â is what I would say if I was a little ***. I don't care. Boom. Megabonk is out now".</p>
<p>Clearly, they were a little <em>insane</em>. Then again, so is every game developer. Nothing is a guaranteed success, it doesn't matter if you're a huge publisher or a solo developer, sometimes it's just pure luck. In this case, they were just onto something great. As the developer posted on X, in two weeks they've made a million sales.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4124974421759833913gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Just to put it into some wider perspective for you. It's had an all-time player peak of 117,336 which it hit on October 5th, which is a little bit more than Hades II has ever seen. And not far off half of the all-time peak for Borderlands 4, which was a massively anticipated game from a huge publisher with lots of marketing.</p>
<p>It's just seriously impressive that we keep seeing these smaller games come along with a tweak on a popular idea, and hit it big like this.</p>
<p>Anyway, Megabonk is cool. Go play it.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) v5.14 brings an improved minimap, particle improvements and UI tweaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luanti (formerly Minetest) has a fresh small release out with v5.14 bringing a couple of gameplay tweaks and various other improvements. What is Luanti? An open source voxel game engine. You can play many different games made with it, like the popular <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/the-minecraft-like-free-and-open-source-game-voxelibre-v0-90-brings-dynamic-settings-and-new-fire-spreading/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VoxeLibre</a> pictured below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4626810671759832437gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - VoxeLibre in Luanti</em></p>
<p>This Luanti release makes a tweak to the main menu to help prevent player confusion, removing world-related options when no world is selected. They've also made it easier to select text in the menu and game text fields, and nametags can now scale by distance to help you see who is nearby and who aren't. Some other changes to the game include an update to particles like the when you're digging, with these now shown to all players, not just you.</p>
<p>My favourite little change from this release is the upgrade to how the minimap works. Now it actually shows the correct tiles on top of land, like grass, so you know exactly what's around you. Small thing but looks much better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/469638001759831915gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Grass on minimap in Devtest before and after</em></p>
<p>There's also been some optimizations to how certain mapblocks are stored, plus textures should now load faster with paths being cached and more.</p>
<p>Lots to come in future release with some of their plans to include inventory image animations, a dark mode theme for the main menu, more accessibility settings and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Dino society is about to fall apart in the pre-apocalyptic action adventure GNAW</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dinosaurs were able to suppress their cannibalistic urges and build a society, where of course it all goes to hell in GNAW. An action platformer metroidvania that will release sometime in 2026, and it really does look impressive. You'll have to take a bite out of this one.</p>
<p>What an interesting spin on dinosaur life and an apocalypse this one is. A "MEATeor" (see what they did there?) crashed into New Dino City, sending its residents into a feral state they had suppressed for millions of years. You'll be running, jumping and spinning through a vast network of interconnected regions as you gradually acquire new powers all while trying to save the city from total collapse.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0eUScZrYfVk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f895a74bce4d12162e0b8dfcb5e8eaf6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0eUScZrYfVk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>âGNAW combines strong and dynamic combat encounters reminiscent of classic â90s mainstays with a lore-rich world full of societal unrest,â says Jon Lawitts, Developer, Redstart Interactive. âThis deinonychus will traverse 7 different regions, each with its own distinct landscapes and platforming challenges, while fending off feral critters and vengeful scientific experiments.â</p>
<p>From the press release it's confirmed to have full Native Linux support, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3833390/GNAW_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demo</a> is live now too.</p>

      <title>Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror - Reforged announced from Revolution Software</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revolution Software just revealed Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror - Reforged, a faithful reimagining of the the classic 1997 adventure game. This will follow up on their success with Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged that was released last year.</p>
<p>"The Smoking Mirror has always been one of our most loved games, and with Reforged we were able to enhance it in ways that respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences". says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. "Just as with the first game, we can't wait for players old and new to experience it again".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hCqq6ngj6Yc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ef948b859c716b40e21c61350823203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hCqq6ngj6Yc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step into the shoes of American tourist George Stobbart and sharp-witted French journalist Nico Collard as they unravel a deadly Mayan conspiracy steeped in ancient artifacts and dark magic.</li>
<li>Travel across Europe, the Carribean, and Central America, solving puzzles, outsmarting enemies, and piecing together the mystery behind the terrifying âSmoking Mirrorâ.</li>
<li>Experience the gameâs iconic locations, illustrated in beautiful high definition, coupled with crisp audio for the first time.</li>
<li>Switch between the original 1997 version of the game and the new reforged visuals at the click of a button.</li>
<li>Play the game the way that you want to - choose between a âtraditional modeâ for people who enjoy adventures the way they used to be, and a âstory modeâ for those who want subtle hints to ensure they never get frustrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>They confirmed in the press release it will have full Linux support.</p>
<p>It's not a set deal yet though for the game to actually properly be complete, as they'll be launching a Kickstarter crowd funding campaign to get it over the finishing line.</p>

      <title>Crysis Remastered Trilogy gets a GOG release with the original Crysis now in the GOG Preservation Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have once again expanded their store with the release of the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis_remastered_trilogy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered Trilogy</a>, along with their promise of keeping the original Crysis working.<em> Be sure to also check out the official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Guide to get GOG games on Linux</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Merge dogs to make bigger dogs in the delightfully silly roguelike deckbuilder Dogpile</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love how delightfully silly Dogpile is as you drop various types of dogs into a vertical yard where they merge into bigger dogs. <em>What a wonderfully cute idea this is.</em></p>
<p>Dogpile is the first collaboration between the co-developers Studio Folly and Toot Games, the audio design team A Shell in the Pit, and the co-publishing team at WINGS.</p>
<p>A roguelike deck-builder they say (everything is a roguelike now apparently). Play your dogs, get money, customise them with special traits to refine your deck and then play more dogs. There's even a demo you can try right now on the Steam page and it works perfectly with Proton 9 on Linux Desktop. It's all about building up your money and bones, which you can then use to extend and upgrade your pack of dogs, and eventually unleash some insane combinations that might just break the game.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aofUQAqCUx8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/777f8e7fa7cd7b0e1684fa2fec3cb936.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aofUQAqCUx8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What really helps to sell it is all the cute little animations on each individual dog. And, like any good deck-builder, there's various special relics (or dog tags in this case) you can buy to help boost you along the way. You'll need that boost too, with the Balatro flavour of it as you attempt to beat the increasing amount of bones you need for each round.</p>
<p>Physics are involved too since you're dropping them into the yard like a big rock, where some unexpected things can happen. Like the dog tag you can get that flips the entire pit when you have to shuffle your deck, which is quite amusing to watch. You can even make the physics <em>bouncier</em> with the right dog tag added to your collection which makes it even funnier.</p>
<p>It's just amusing that they call where you place your dogs the yard, but it's as if the yard is completely vertical, so they drop into what looks like a pit. A pit of dogs. <em>I'm sure that's totally safe right?</em></p>
<p>Your dog cards have all sorts of individual special traits too. Some might help you, some might mess with you. Traits like dropping another dog instantly from your hand, or being crated so they cannot combine. Other traits are quite funny like how they might push other dogs away from barking (which is especially hilarious with bouncy upgrades).</p>
<p>The more I played of it to see all of the traits and upgrades available in the demo, the more I fell in love with it and I think you'll love it too.</p>
<p>Right onto my wishlist this went. The demo was but a small slice but a brilliant idea.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>LEGO The Incredibles gets a small update to improve Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO The Incredibles from TT Games / Warner Bros. recently had a small update to bring it up to an official Steam Deck Playable status.</p>
<p>In the update posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/818320/view/547873227591910840" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they didn't go into any details on what's changed, but they did note that Steam Cloud saving is also now enabled. They previously did similar small updates for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-gets-updated-and-its-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LEGO The Lord of the Rings</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/lego-batman-2-dc-super-heroes-gets-steam-deck-verified-and-cloud-saves/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes</a> which are both now Steam Deck Verified. In the case of LEGO The Incredibles, small text is stopping it being fully Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8114851571759746452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Would be nice if the developers actually explained what they changed. Still, nice to see classic games get updated don't you think?</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience the thrilling adventures of the Parr family as they conquer crime and family life through both Disney-Pixar films The Incredibles and Incredibles 2, in a LEGOÂ® world full of fun and humor. LEGOÂ® The Incredibles allows players to explore action-packed story levels and an epic hub world - including Municiberg, as they use their unique âSuperâ abilities to bring the cityâs Super Villains to justice. Gamers can also team up with family and friends in 2 player co-op to assemble incredible LEGOÂ® builds!</p>

      <title>Fan-made Unreal remake Unreal Redux shows off a fancy new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With no release date yet, the fan-made remake of Unreal named Unreal Redux looks like it's really coming along nicely. Epic Games won't be doing their own remaster or remaking any time soon, so it's up to the community to show off what a classic Unreal the FPS actually is.</p>
<p>Calling it a remake doesn't quite do it justice though, as technically it's mod as it's still being made for the original Unreal with Unreal Engine 1 thanks to the community OldUnreal patches.</p>
<p>See their latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Pw8zyKdyQsQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/641ef675607061b62c223b68a569d376.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pw8zyKdyQsQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the <a href="https://unrealredux.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unreal Redux is a fan made project to remake the game Unreal which was released in the year 1998. This remake will stay close to the original game but will be enhanced with new features.</p>
<p>Unreal 1 was revolutionary for its time and the Redux version will transport the player back into the past to revive the unique feelings and emotions conveyed by the original game.</p>
<p>This remake is based and runs on Unreal Engine 1 which is extremely enhanced by the new oldunrealâs 227 patch. Therefore, the remake is able to catch the flair and atmosphere of the original Unreal while beeing improved with new visual effects and gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>The insane weaponry of Unreal becomes more visually stunning than before and gives now the feedback that they are kicking asses for sure!</p>
<p>Unreal Redux will be a new experience to everyone who is stranded on NaPali.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buckshot Roulette meets Big Pharma in the latest game from Free Lives, and it's as grim as you might expect it to be with that sort of description.</p>
<p>Two test subjects. One twisted medical trial. Only one leaves. Each round you'll be presented with a selection of pills. Some are helpful, some are harmful, and some mean instant death.

<li>Youâre not alone - The other patient wants to outlast you. Theyâll bluff, adapt, and use everything at their disposal to keep breathing one dose longer than you.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Unity devs are scrambling to update their games due to a recent security issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Unity team recently <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> a security issue in their game engine, with lots of developers scrambling to update their games. Valve actually already implemented their own fix to help with it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/steam-stable-update-brings-end-of-life-notice-for-32-bit-windows-and-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam Client update</a> but a fix in games is still the best thing for developers to do.</p>
<p>Some developers temporarily removed their games for sale while they worked to update their games to a newer version of Unity. According to Unity the affect platforms included Android, Linux, Windows and macOS. The Unity team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications that were built using affected versions of the Unity Editor are susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system, which could enable local code execution or information disclosure at the privilege level of the vulnerable application. There is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability nor has there been any impact on users or customers. Unity has provided fixes that address the vulnerability and they are already available to all developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prompted Valve to even post their own full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/524229329545071275?utm_source=SteamDB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on it for developers as it's such a major issue.</p>
<p>It affects the Unity game engine going back quite a lot of versions, however Unity are only supporting fixes for Unity 2019.1 or newer.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.16 released with fast synchronization support using NTSync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the weekend Wine 10.16 was released finally answering all the questions on when NTSync will land - well it's here now.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main changes from Wine 10.16 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast synchronization support using NTSync.</li>
<li>16-bit apps supported in new WoW64 mode.</li>
<li>Initial support for D3DKMT objects.</li>
<li>WinMD (Windows Metadata) files generated and installed.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To benefit from NTSync you still need a recent Linux kernel version, with kernel 6.14 or later. You likely also need to actually enable NTSync in the kernel, as most distributions do not have it on by default.</p>
<p>For bugs fixed in this release they noted improvements for Need for Speed III, Shadow Company: Left for Dead, Alpha Polaris, Face Noir, A Stroke of Fate series, Overwatch, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, Metro 2033, Project CARS, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and New Order, Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II and more.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.16" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine GitLab</a></p>
<p>We're still waiting on Proton 10 from Valve exiting Beta, which should hopefully be soon and then onto Wine 11 and Proton 11 sometime eventually next year.</p>
