      <title>Spider-Man Remastered is awesome on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Spider-Man Remastered now available on Steam after previously being PlayStation exclusive, I took it for a spin on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Just before release it was Steam Deck Verified and thankfully, the rating is absolutely correct here. With some really good defaults, Spider-Man Remastered is fantastic to play on the Steam Deck. I actually completed it years ago on the PS4, so I know the gameplay and story very well. Getting to play it wherever I want on the Steam Deck though — what absolute joy! This is easily going to be my favourite game of this year to play on Deck.</p>
<p>Check out my video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iV1eLjqn1lE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f584a37fb48812cbd8698fe1abf16903.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iV1eLjqn1lE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How about the Linux desktop though? How does it run?</p>
<p>Well, it's a little quirky. It will complain about GPU drivers every time without fail and if you have a controller plugged in, it will <em>crash</em> before the intro video every time. Unplug your controller, and it works 100% of the time. Plug the controller back in at the menu and at least on NVIDIA, it works fine then.</p>
<p>Performance seems reasonable during fights, on the High preset settings at 1080p with an NVIDIA 2080ti it was consistently well above 100FPS. When swinging around though, it drops down below 100FPS quite a lot.</p>

      <title>yuzu the Nintendo Switch Emulator gets an easy Linux installer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Linux and Steam Deck fans, the yuzu team <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-linux-installer/" target="_blank">have worked</a> to bring the installer for the Nintendo Switch Emulator over to Linux properly.</p>
<p>This was a bit of a sore spot, while you could still install it relatively easily having the proper installer just puts another tick in the box for making it that bit simpler for everyone. Why have they done it now though? As they said previously it was mostly Windows users playing with it but over time they've seen "consistent growth in the number of our Linux users" and so it was only natural for them to improve their own support of Linux.</p>
<p>This new installer supports Mainline and Early Access builds for Linux users. With Early Access builds being available for their Patreon supporters.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18351965881660303163gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18351965881660303163gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The work was done by a user going by the handle <a href="https://github.com/lat9nq" target="_blank">toastUnlimited</a>. As with any new thing, it might have some issues so be sure to report any you find.</p>

      <title>Retro racer Horizon Chase Turbo gets a big free Adventures game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Chase Turbo is a very highly rated retro racing game from developer AQUIRIS and today it sees a huge free upgrade. This is to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the franchise.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before, it's directly inspired by a bunch of different classic racers from the 80s and 90s like Out Run, Lotus Turbo Challenge, Top Gear (SNES), Rush and plenty more. This is a straight to the point arcade racer with no extra fluff, just you and the track.</p>
<p>The Adventure game mode update will bring with it a series of five challenges available for each of the 34 cars in the game, totaling 170 different races to beat. You also get a new skin for each of the cars in the game, as a reward for completing each adventure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XGreyhCzTtc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8917da69440cba0f4c2cbb41c383a9a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XGreyhCzTtc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like a pretty sweet free update!</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horizon-chase-turbo?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/389140/Horizon_Chase_Turbo/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified!</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight is getting cross-platform Steam Cloud Saves to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight developer Team Cherry has announced that an update due to go live on Monday, August 15th will bring a much needed change to the saving system.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/3406429723545099871" target="_blank">Steam post</a>, the developer said "Soon we'll be making some changes in order to support cross-platform cloud saves between Windows, MacOS, and Linux (including the Steam Deck)!" with the plan for it to go live on Monday at 5AM UTC. There's a few important notes they also included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MacOS and Linux users will need to play the game once for Steam to upload their existing local save files to cloud storage</li>
<li>Windows users should not need to do anything, except:</li>
<li>Cross-platform users who manually migrated their save files between platforms may have conflicting files. When steam prompts you to keep or overwrite your files it is important to choose the correct one carefully (which will depend on your own situation). If in doubt, back up your save files first!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to make a backup of your save here's the locations:</p>
<p>Windows:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Code_1Aels"><code class="inline-code">%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/Team Cherry/Hollow Knight</code></div>
<p><br/>
MacOS:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Code_1Aels"><code class="inline-code">~/Library/Application Support/unity.Team Cherry.Hollow Knight</code></div>
<p><br/>
Linux:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Code_1Aels"><code class="inline-code">~/.config/unity3d/Team Cherry/Hollow Knight</code></div>
<hr/>
<p>Not mentioned in their post, but there is currently a rare issue where the graphics might glitch-out completely. To get around this, you can set the game into OpenGL mode by setting this in the game launch options in the Properties of the game in your Steam Library:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">-force-opengl</code></p>

      <title>Valheim gets a small teaser as Iron Gate get back to work on Mistlands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim is due to get a huge upgrade at some point, which most players are now waiting on and Iron Gate have given the smallest of teasers on it again. Their team took a bit of a break recently they mentioned in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3401926123918063730" target="_blank">update post</a>, but they said they're now back at their desks working away on the next update.</p>
<p>Firstly though, a fix is on the way for an unfortunate crashing issue, you can find some help on that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/vssxdi/how_to_restore_most_recent_working_world_save/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next major update, Mistlands, Iron Gate say it's going to be "quite a chunky update, with a lot of things we haven’t shown yet". It will come with new recipes and meals with loads of work on that already done and a sneaky teaser picture was included for people to guess away at:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3369940201660300276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3369940201660300276gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also mentioned again the new Black Marble material that's coming which you'll find in the Mistlands. Players were excited about that so they've shown a fresh preview of something with it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12429990541660300341gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12429990541660300341gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I honestly haven't touched Valheim in ages, as I don't want to spoil myself before this huge upgrade. Overall the game still seems to be doing well though, with it regularly seeing multiple tens of thousands playing each day. I imagine the player count will rocket upwards once the Mistlands update is out.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Two Point Campus from the dev of Two Point Hospital out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Campus is the next game from Two Point Studios and SEGA, the same lot that gave us Two Point Hospital. It comes with Native Linux support and works on the Steam Deck right away.</p>
<p>It shares a huge amount with Two Point Hospital, as clearly that was the blueprint they've applied here but of course it's a whole new setting. You're building up your own educational campus environment but it's not as boring as it sounds. Naturally, it has a bunch of fun twists on it where your students will be doing all kinds of ridiculous things including spell-casting wizardry, dragon-slaying knight school or top-secret spy school. Oh, and there's a fun announcer once again that has a number of silly lines to read out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FnjqPkajRnc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8757ad6f88116df86fff3d6237d03945.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FnjqPkajRnc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been testing it across both my Steam Deck and Linux desktop and it seems to work great. The Linux version is using Vulkan, so performance seem to be pretty great even on the Deck at high settings. Gamepad support is basically perfect too, so it will suit many different types of gamers.</p>
<p>Here's some quick footage from the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zyYPiCZbdaU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e56d55c36cc976ffc5fd83a809ef3756.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zyYPiCZbdaU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can't wait to put a ton more time into this on the Steam Deck while in bed. Saves worked great between the Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux PC too, so no issues there. Good to see Steam Cloud supported properly out of the box.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/two-point-campus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649080/Two_Point_Campus/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>W4 Games formed to help developers using Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a very interesting development for the world of the open source Godot Engine, as a new company named <a href="https://w4games.com/" target="_blank">W4 Games</a> has been formed to push it further than ever before. Founded by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> veterans Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, and veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato the idea is to provide commercial assistance to developers of all sorts using Godot Engine.</p>
<p>One of the goals (there will be a number) is to help developers access console markets, which has been a problem for Godot Engine since it's fully open source and can't just include everything needed to publish on consoles as they've historically been restrictive with things like their SDK. So one goal of W4 Games is to help there, as their FAQ mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>W4 was created to satisfy commercial needs of the corporate game industry that are currently unaddressed, by providing products and services to companies that need them in order to move to Godot from other technologies. This includes services offering such as enterprise support plans and the possibility to access markets that were previously unreached by Godot, such as console platforms. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just one small part of it though, as their <a href="https://w4games.com/2022/08/09/hello-world-w4-games/" target="_blank">announcement</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>W4 Games was formed to strengthen the Godot ecosystem by providing both enterprise and independent developers with a complementary suite of commercial products and services to successfully develop and publish video games to all existing platforms in the market. Further announcements about these products and services will be made over the coming weeks and months as they become available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anyone suddenly worried — Godot Engine remains community built, owned and run and will continue to be. This is just a few of their team hoping to keep pushing open source to the masses of developers out there.</p>

      <title>What if Pong had &#39;lore, special moves &amp; gay aliens&#39;? You get ZONERS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of ZONERS certainly had an interesting pitch when introducing their new game over email and it turns out it's pretty fun. Scanning over my inbox recently and I come across "What if pong had lore, special moves &amp; gay aliens?" as a title and that's certainly one way to grab my attention.</p>
<p>Coming from developer Paris Stalker / ALL iN who also made a hardcore action platformer called <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/some-thoughts-on-ersatz-the-speed-focused-hardcore-action-platformer-with-a-musical-twist/" target="_blank">ERSATZ</a>.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned that it features "a diverse cast of atypical aliens, tons of ongoing accessibility and customisation work, bizarre lore, an insane original soundtrack (OK, I did write a couple of the songs myself, so <em>mostly</em> insane), way too much effort put into the menus, and the determination of a stubborn git after like 7 rejections from indie focused publishers, what isn't to love?".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Iioz5JuT1AU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e978d3c52097832089d725fe03e4d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Iioz5JuT1AU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you essential get here is another take on the style of Windjammers. It's basically a hyper version of Pong for sure and if you love these sorts of fast-paced arcade sports games, you can't really go wrong. A little rough around the edges with it being an Early Access game but so much to love about it already.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598030/ZONERS/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack is another fun looking point and clicker coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love your point and click adventures? We have another to highlight with Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack that will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack, you play three characters trying to unite lost lovers, getting a fun-loving caveman back to his own time, all while steering clear of the scary-looking robots trying to erase you from the timeline. Originally funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warmkitten/justin-wack-and-the-big-time-hack" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> raising $32k due to the support of 469 backers, including Ron Gilbert (of Monkey Island fame). Linux support was a stretch-goal that seemingly wasn't hit but they're doing it now anyway.</p>

      <title>Adventure game Nine Noir Lives seems to let you lick everything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nine Noir Lives is an upcoming point and click adventure game that follows feline private investigator Cuddles Nutterbutter. A new brief trailer is out, showing off a very important game mechanic.</p>
<p>Licking. Yes, you are a cat after all and who knows — licking something might give you an all important clue.</p>
<p>Shown off yesterday for International Cat Day, a new short teaser trailer showed a bit more of the gameplay and the lick mechanic. A bowl of snacks? Cuddles licks it. A sentient computer? Cuddles licks that too. Another cat dressed as a milk carton? I think you get the idea.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cRIuI23ZWeo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1095f1d85e7c467e3c918dd80f4ed222.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cRIuI23ZWeo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by the likes of Grim Fandango and Broken Sword along with the works of classic film noir from Shakespeare, and Taika Waititi the two-person team at Silvernode Games are working hard to create a point-and-click adventure game that pays tribute to the past while curling up in its own unique niche.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brought Up on Feline-y Charges: </strong>A charming comedy-noir storyline set in the unique and intriguing city of Meow Meow Furrington, inspired by every cat ever and with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.</li>
<li><strong>A Point-and-Lick Adventure: </strong>Discover a whole new dimension to everything in the game by using Cuddles’ tongue. Lick first, and ask questions later. Questions like "what did you expect that to taste like, Cuddles?"</li>
<li><strong>S’more Cats Equals S’more Fun: </strong>Experience the city from two very different perspectives as you switch between Cuddles and his trusty assistant, Tabby Marshmallow.</li>
<li><strong>Purrfect Voice Acting: </strong>Laugh and learn about the world of Furth with over a hundred thousand words of fully-voiced dialogue performed by an all-star cast including Lucas Gilbertson (<em>Megaman X</em>), Carol-Anne Day (<em>A Hat in Time</em>) and SungWon Cho (<em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a performance fix available in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the recent SteamOS 3.3 release, it came with some unfortunate performance issues for the Steam Deck that Valve continues to address. The first was a random bit of micro-stutter <a href="https://youtu.be/53aWJrfIkX8" target="_blank">that I highlighted</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/rIU26Tn-UYI" target="_blank">Valve fixed</a>, but it seems there were other problems.</p>
<p>Now you can opt into the Preview update channel on your Steam Deck to get these fixes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3360267192939212657" target="_blank">new update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily reverted Red Dead Redemption 2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to do it?</p>
<p>Just hit the Steam button and go into Settings. Then System and find the Steam Update Channel and select Preview there. Then scroll up and check for updates and let it download. Your Steam Deck will reboot after it's finished.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 4,500 games officially Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After only being available for a few months now officially and with Valve still going through the reservation queue, the Steam Deck has hit 4,500 titles officially marked Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Five months in, that's pretty good going don't you think? Usual reminder though, this is only the number that has been formally verified by Valve directly. The actual number of titles playable will be far greater. Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes unlisted titles, these are the current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 1988</li>
<li>Playable - 2512</li>
<li>Unsupported - 1834</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently Verified titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336120/Bridge_Constructor_The_Walking_Dead/" target="_blank">Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/259060/Dominions_4_Thrones_of_Ascension/" target="_blank">Dominions 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/799640/Dungeon_Munchies/" target="_blank">Dungeon Munchies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/80310/Gemini_Rue/" target="_blank">Gemini Rue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114870/Lennas_Inception/" target="_blank">Lenna's Inception</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1389550/Mind_Scanners/" target="_blank">Mind Scanners</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I recently picked up a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919460/Seraphs_Last_Stand/" target="_blank">Seraph's Last Stand</a> to play on Deck and it's surprisingly sweet. Only £0.79 too! It sort-of scratches the same itch the likes of Vampire Survivors does, with waves of enemies and tons of upgrades to pick but it's inspired by the classic Heli Attack. Instead of you running around a big area, you're running along the bottom of the screen facing off enemies coming down at you and all the firing ends up looking like fireworks. Worth a go, slow to start but once you get going it's absolutely mental.</p>

      <title>Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder releases September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After currently being in Early Access for around 10 months, Despot’s Game: Dystopian Army Builder is set to fully release for all platforms on September 15.</p>
<p>It's a very unique auto-battling dungeon crawler, where you build up an army of people with classes that you won't really find in any other game. They're hilariously varied! You can have a chef, someone with a laser sword, pretzel-throwers, someone with large bionic arms (think Dr. Otto Octavius from Spider Man), someone with boxing gloves and the list goes on. It's ridiculous — in all the rights ways. The full release will come with some reworked mechanics, new quests, new enemies and mutations, an expanded soundtrack and much more.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also just released:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q8HxA0fkEBQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/61d16ce711245f1f8ff064e51a1396e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q8HxA0fkEBQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Despot’s Game represents our childhood and all of our love for gaming wrapped in one,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “The weapons are filled with easter eggs that represent cult movies, TV shows, games and books we read growing up. It’s really fun to see players’ excitement when they recognize and relate to them as well, because without our community, it wouldn’t have been possible to create this game.”</p>
<p>If you pick up Despot’s Game before the full release, you will receive a DLC named "Despot’s Game: Challenges" free.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/despots-game?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227280/Despots_Game_Dystopian_Army_Builder/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21 is out now and you can easily upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In case you didn't already know Linux Mint 21 is officially out now with editions that come with the Cinnamon, MATE or Xfce desktop environments.</p>
<p>Safe to use on the desktop for gaming and work for many years, as it's a long-term support release that will keep going until 2027 with updates thanks to it being based upon Ubuntu 22.04. You will get Linux Kernel 5.15 and depending on which edition you go for Cinnamon 5.4, MATE 1.26 or Xfce 4.16.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2578861191659967663gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2578861191659967663gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition</em></p>
<p>Largely the same as the Beta I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/linux-mint-21-beta-now-available/" target="_blank">previously covered</a>. With major changes to the display manager in Cinnamon, based on a much more modern version of Mutter that was previously rather outdated. They've also ported over the display settings from Gnome, plus plenty of theme tweaks to make applications match with the GTK theme.</p>
<p>Some of the other major changes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A switch from Blueberry to Blueman for Bluetooth</li>
<li>New Xapp project called xapp-thumbnailers, providing thumbnails for many more file types</li>
<li>Upgrades to the Sticky Notes application</li>
<li>A process monitor to inform you when automated tasks are happening that might slow your PC down</li>
<li>Webp support was added to xviewer and thumbnailers.</li>
<li>The WebApp manager supports additional browsers and custom browser parameters.</li>
<li>In Software Sources, the repository list, PPA list and key list support multiple selection. This allows several items to be removed at a time.</li>
<li>Mint now uses IPP (Driverless Printing and Scanning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus lots more.</p>
<p>How to upgrade? Linux Mint 20.3 to version 21 is reasonably easy and supported. In terminal run these commands:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt update<br/>
sudo apt install mintupgrade<br/>
sudo mintupgrade</code></p>
<p>Then you will be greeted by the official UI upgrade tool to follow along. After it's completed you can run these to finish:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt remove mintupgrade<br/>
sudo reboot</code></p>
<p>You can download from the <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Halo Infinite working plus Airborne Kingdom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/proton-70-4-is-coming-to-bring-more-compatibility-to-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-4 getting a Release Candidate</a>, Valve has put up a new build of Proton Experimental and it's quite an exciting one. This is the special version of Proton you can try, that often pulls in new features and fixes earlier to get more Windows games working on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Newly playable in Proton Experimental from August 5th include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>ToGather:Island</li>
</ul>
<p>They also note that Halo Infinite is now playable. However, it comes with issues. On desktop you'll need the Mesa git drivers and there's lots of graphical issues with NVIDIA. On Steam Deck and an AMD desktop, you will see see some minor artifacts. Hopefully those won't take too long to solve.</p>
<p>Additional fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix recent regression that caused VRChat to intermittently hang.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems there might be some issues with the Flatpak version of Steam on desktop (and older distros), as it needs a newer version of Mesa so keep that in mind as Experimental now needs Mesa 22 or NVIDIA 510.47 or newer. Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at how it runs on Steam Deck along with how to switch it over to Proton Experimental:</p>

<p><em>Pretty impressive! Online play works just fine too.</em></p>

<p>If you wish to try it and give feedback, Valve are mainly interested in issues that are directly new in the release candidate builds. So if you find something is broken between Proton 7.0-3 and Proton 7.0-4, Valve need to know about it. A lot of the changes are coming over from previous builds of Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>You can report issues on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6062" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Top quick Steam Deck tips and tricks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Valve are ramping up production and a ton more people than expected will get their Steam Deck this year, plus the expansion into Asia, it was a good time to get some basic quick tips and tricks sorted for you.</p>
<p>I have plenty of guides on here in various articles and on the YouTube channel, although good they're quite spread-out so this is a nice quick reference to jump back to when you need some info. Consider it something of a starter guide for quickly getting up to speed with the Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="59R3k4s1aPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8dc5ae2c1c41e4f2396c8806c0f263d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/59R3k4s1aPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's included:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can hold down the Steam or Quick Access button to get a list of shortcuts, these shortcuts work with both buttons, not just the Steam button. An example is Steam+X for opening the keyboard anywhere, and Steam + Right Shoulder button to make a screenshot. You can also hold down the Steam button and then move the right stick to move a mouse cursor any time too. You can even press the Steam and B button together, to force a game to shutdown if you need to. There’s many other shortcuts, so don’t forget to check back on it.</li>
<li>Plenty of games that aren’t verified work great. You can check <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for reports on unverified games which is a fully crowdsourced collection, anyone can test a game on Steam Deck or Linux and submit an entry on how it runs.</li>
<li>Run the screen at 40Hz and 40FPS from the Quick Access menu available by pressing the three dot button on the Steam Deck and going into the Performance menu which has the battery icon. It gives you a simple way to maximise battery life with good performance.</li>
<li>If you’re going to open up the steam deck, <strong>take the sd card out first</strong>, or you will snap the card. I died a little inside when I killed a 1TB card doing that.</li>
<li>Steam Input is your friend, allowing you to fully customize the controls of every single game. You can access it via the controller icon on the games page in your library, or while playing a game by pressing the Steam button, going to the right and selecting Controller Settings at the bottom. Here you can map all the buttons to anything like a mouse, keyboard, turn on gryo, map the back buttons, change deadzones and so much more.</li>
<li>Use both trackpads for typing with the on-screen keyboard, it’s a lot faster.</li>
<li>If you find the WiFi not working well, especially on 5Ghz networks, try turning on developer mode and then turning off Wifi Power Management. You’ll see more power usage but it might just fix your issues.</li>
<li>To access the full desktop mode, you can hold the power button down for a few seconds and select Switch to Desktop or press the Steam button go down to Power and select it there.</li>
<li>Change the location of where screenshots are saved, so you can access them easier in desktop mode. To do it, in desktop mode go into Steam settings -&gt; in-game menu and change the folder to where you want it to be. You can also select to have higher quality screenshots here too.</li>
<li>If you’re at home a lot, just buy a long <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08J41QTNN/" target="_blank">USB-C cable</a> and keep it plugged in with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08GSSZGWV/" target="_blank">charger</a> when gaming if you can, it will save your battery life.</li>
<li>If you’re going to be using a newer Xbox controller over Bluetooth, update the firmware otherwise it won’t connect properly.</li>
<li>Desktop mode has the Discover software centre, giving you the option to install a ton of extra software like Discord.</li>
<li>If you have games on GOG or Epic Games, the Heroic Games Launcher available in Discover is your friend. It allows you to login and download games, and then run them through a compatibility layer.</li>
<li>Adding third-party apps and games to Steam is easy enough too. Open desktop mode, load up the Steam client and go to the big add game button to the left or the Games menu at the top of the client. Then they will also be available in the normal Gaming Mode in the Non-Steam section of the Library.</li>

      <title>Open source game development advances with Godot Engine 3.5 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine, the free and open source full game development engine has a big new release available with <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop" target="_blank">version 3.5</a>. This is not the version that comes with Vulkan and the big rendering overhaul, that's coming in Godot 4 which is due for a proper Release Candidate sometime soon.</p>
<p>Godot 3.5 brings with it 9 months of development on new features and bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully overhauled navigation system</li>
<li>Physics interpolation in 3D</li>
<li>A lot more powerful and flexible Tween system</li>
<li>Long awaited Label3D node out of the box to display text in 3D scenes</li>
<li>Accessing nodes by unique names</li>
<li>Asynchronous shader compilation + caching</li>
<li>A more adaptable and easy way to add basic occlusion culling</li>
<li>+ Lots more</li>
</ul>
<p>For this release they teamed up with the great people of <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/" target="_blank">GDQuest</a> to show it all off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NjIJm2jax68"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe59d6b3bc3855038ba4398923260c8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NjIJm2jax68" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Wonderful to see Godot Engine advance so much, it's quickly becoming one of the absolute best game engines around and since it's free and open source the rug cannot be pulled from beneath the feet of developers. I do hope more teams take a look at it, especially with the top Linux support it offers for both development and game exports.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 gets Save States support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge advancement for the PlayStation 3 emulator project <a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a> as it now has support for Save States, which is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>For those who don't know: Save States are not like normal Save Data. What it does it take an exact snapshot of what is happening, so you can re-load to that exact state of the game at another time and it could be while you're anywhere and doing anything in any game. A lot of other emulators already support such a feature.</p>
<p>The new feature was announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1555043140461019136" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, with one of their team mentioning on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/wfrcvg/comment/iivig4x/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="_3cjCphgls6DH-irkVaA0GM" data-testid="comment">
<div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root" style="color:#D7DADC">
<p>We didn't think it was realistically feasible several years ago, but after a lot of work, it's here!</p>
<p>Some savestates will be of a couple GBs of size depending on the game, and there are still certain limitations, but those are just small issues in the grand scheme of things.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>With it now in, they can continue improving it and there are some limitations to be aware of. Like right now if you do a Save State, the game will close. You can just reboot it to carry on and the Save State will be sorted as it's just a technical hurdle they will overcome at some point. In future, major updates to RPCS3 might be incompatible with older Save States too but you could just continue running an older version for it.</p>

      <title>Valve spoke to IGN Japan about the Steam Deck, here&#39;s a few takeaway points</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Valve expands the Steam Deck into Asia, they've begun a series of interviews and one on video with IGN Japan was quite interesting so here's the main points. While a lot of it was already known, it's still nice to reiterate just how all-in Valve are on the Steam Deck and during the video it also shows off some rather fun looking prototype devices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20951893241659705276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20951893241659705276gol1.jpg"/></a>Picture credit - IGN Japan</em></p>
<p>I hope they're still working on that new controller design. I've said it before and I'll say it again — I will be first in line for a new Steam Controller. One that has both sticks and the trackpads would simply be amazing, just like the Steam Deck has and would make playing it docked so much nicer for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The full IGN Japan interview (round-up below):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nEFixPrVdhA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85fe1139193dc01b8ee4e421def9f6ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nEFixPrVdhA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's a little round-up of some interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's plenty of continuity between their previous hardware and the Steam Deck, with lots that helped to complete the Steam Deck like working on the Valve Index helped their production lines. Steam Link helped towards Remote Play and so on. Valve Index controller for example was an important stepping stone in regards to dealing with batteries.</li>
<li>Valve confirmed again that they will "only use Proton when there's no Linux version of a game", however they learned from Steam Machines and working with developers to get Linux ports that it often wasn't worth it and why they worked on Proton. Since the Steam Deck, it's been far easier to get Proton working for new release as they've been working with developers.</li>
<li>Linux is a benefit to them since it's open source, as it means they can work to fix issues and features quicker than reporting it to someone else and keep improving as they don't have to report it to someone else and wait on them.</li>
<li>Japan was on their list to ship the Steam Deck to from day 1 but they had to work out the distribution.</li>
<li>They think the Steam Deck will be a multi-generational product, they expect there to be future iterations and they're finding the right balance to give developers a stable product to target but they wish to follow the PC model of constant improvement. No time span yet.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam adds support for Nintendo Joy-Con controllers in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam is ever-improving and constantly expanding what is supported by Steam Input. Just recently they added a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3387288790681635164" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> with support for the Nintendo Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p>This follows on from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-gets-support-for-nintendo-online-classic-controllers/" target="_blank">stable Steam Client release</a> which added support for the Nintendo Online classic controllers including the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis controllers.</p>
<p>With the new Beta released on August 4th Valve has now added the official Nintendo Joy-Con controller support, that can be used individually as a mini-gamepad or them both combined. Additionally, support for the Nintendo Online classic controllers has also now been improved.</p>
<p>So a tiny update in terms of what's new but still a very welcome one.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty incredible just how wide the controller support is on Steam now. It's likely you can just pick up close to any controller and it will work.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the Necrodancer: SYNCHRONY DLC released into Early Access</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A pleasant surprise for Crypt of the Necrodancer fans! SYNCHRONY, a new DLC for Necrodancer, released today into early access. This surprise content for the pioneering 2015 rythm-roguelike is itself an act of necromancy, as until recently the game had not seen new content since the Amplified DLC in 2017. Today's release of Synchrony into EA follows a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-gets-a-big-surprise-update-with-more-to-come/" target="_blank">July update to the base game</a> aimed at making Necrodancer compatible with Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MX9JlggiCHo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca65c1a7f4bd3e0396ea5b57c0f6d01d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MX9JlggiCHo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The biggest addition in Synchrony is co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes, but there is lots of content for solo gamers as well. Here's the feature list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer support for up to 8 players in co-op and vs modes!</li>
<li>New character: Chaunter -- Posesses enemies and fights using their powers!</li>
<li>New character: Suzu -- Speedy character with an invincible dash attack!</li>
<li>New character: Klarinetta -- Does battle with a huge two-handed sword!</li>
<li>Full mod support allowing most aspects of the game to be modded!</li>
<li>An integrated mod portal, and the ability to load multiple mods at once!</li>
<li>New weapons, spells, items, enemies, shrines, traps, and more!</li>
<li>Even more features to come during Early Access!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've never played Necrodancer it's an easy recommendation. The game is set up like a classic roguelike but the turns happen to the beat of the music rather than waiting for player input. The phenomenal OST was composed by Danny Baranowsky (Super Meatboy, Canabalt, Cortex Command), and you will be banging your fingers (and occasionally your face) into your keyboard to one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever made.</p>
<p>When I read about one of the competitive modes in Synchrony I was reminded of watching a competitive speedrun of Necrodancer at Games Done Quick where two players raced to finish the game - it seemed like a ton of fun. Here's the video if you'd like to take a look. To be clear, this is not the Synchrony DLC, it's just two very good Necrodancers playing the base game with the Amplified DLC.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3a3EcSZeZs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/273f541977f47db3cd3d2d9cb0945830.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3a3EcSZeZs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Synchrony is released natively for Linux into Early Access with an expected full release in late 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer_synchrony" target="_blank">GOG</a> (soon) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Claim the fun and challenging Frick, Inc. from Kenney FREE for 24 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frick, Inc. is an amusing game with a name that's slightly silly because it's fricking frustrating too. The developer, Kenney, has made it free to <a href="https://kenney.itch.io/frick-inc" target="_blank">grab on itch.io</a> for 24 hours.</p>
<p>In the game you control a little vehicle and have to move it around a small course. However, the controls are what make it interesting. Instead of using traditional mouse, keyboard or gamepad — you have to flick buttons and switches on the screen to direct the vehicle around. It can be surprisingly challenging and a good bit of fun. Each vehicle has a different controls setup too, meaning you need to keep learning. It's a little gem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EPNE9hMSrVw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df31ea8529fa7d5995b6b1662b402063.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EPNE9hMSrVw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Nara: Facing Fire inspired by Hollow Knight is live on Kickstarter with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another beautiful and engaging looking metroidvania? Loved Hollow Knight? You should keep an eye on Nara: Facing Fire that's live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glowing-glade/nara-facing-fire-a-hand-drawn-fantasy-metroidvania/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. A game I briefly covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/fantasy-metroidvania-nara-facing-fire-blends-hollow-knight-and-ori/" target="_blank">last month</a>, the developer plans to offer full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It's directly inspired by Hollow Knight, Ori and Celeste with challenging bosses and a focus on the fluid and responsive movement mechanics. Those are some big names to live up to but the early footage in the trailer (that's a work in progress) definitely looks the part. The Kickstarter has a €90,000 goal and 29 days to hit it with over €11,000 pledged already.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CK0vfKd-OwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de949b061a1a3c4518c805f17e687fd1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CK0vfKd-OwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers mention you will be exploring a vast open world full of secrets, lots of different characters to meet and plenty of creatures to befriend or fight. It's non-linear too and it sounds like there's multiple endings to it too. Since there's a big focus on the combat, they said their main goal was "for the player to have complete control over Nara's actions at all times while handcrafting the animation transitions to be as smooth as possible" with there being no special acceleration added to the character and abilities have a short "windup time", so you get smooth movement and combat that gives you "the ability to truly express their skill and mechanics which allows for very clean and epic looking speedruns".</p>
<p>All looks and sounds pretty good. I'm honestly surprised it's not funded already.</p>
<p>Follow along on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2087320/Nara_Facing_Fire/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam page</a> and fund it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glowing-glade/nara-facing-fire-a-hand-drawn-fantasy-metroidvania/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx adds diseases, makes you care for the elderly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder that made a bit of a splash at release selling a few thousand copies pretty quickly, but as always many more games appear and some fall off the radar but Songs of Syx continues expanding.</p>
<p>This Native Linux game had a lot going for it at release, so many put quite a lot of hours into it. Since the initial Early Access build in September 2020 they've added in new military units, a much smarter AI, entertainment, religion, reproduction, riots, cannibals, big war mechanics and the list goes on.</p>
<p>A new update just released adding even more mechanics to the game now including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Personal homes</li>
<li>New tech tree</li>
<li>Elderly care</li>
<li>Disease &amp; health</li>
<li>World camps</li>
<li>A new species and religion.</li>
<li>Balance and fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new update video below:</p>

      <title>Last Call BBS, the final game from Zachtronics has left Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Call BBS, the final game from the clever people at Zachtronics has left Early Access and is out now along with Native Linux support. Such a shame to see such a great developer move on. They've had some really amazing games over the years with my personal favourite being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/01/opus-magnum-is-an-exceptional-puzzle-game-available-for-linux/" target="_blank">Opus Magnum</a> from 2017.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is actually multiple games in one package:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>

      <title>No more DLC for Oxygen Not Included, devs decide to do free updates instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is not getting any more DLC, Klei Entertainment has announced. Instead, they're going to keep pumping out free updates for all players. What is it? ONI is a space colony building game where you have to manage a growing group of people in a hostile environment.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/457140/view/3388414690589449312" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developers explained they had been planning a second major DLC but they've decided it "wasn’t the right fit for our long-term goals" and that they want the game to feel like a "true universe" with it continuing to expand. Most importantly, they don't want to split the community again and limit their own design choices with the game as they would have to decide between main features and DLC.</p>
<p>They also explained that the more DLC they would do, the harder it would be to maintain for everyone. So instead they're "shifting our focus to building out a lot of the same content and systems you’d expect from a DLC, and releasing them regularly as free game updates that work for both base game and Spaced Out".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515855861659619312gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515855861659619312gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Very nice!</p>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's a Native Linux game and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the current most-played games on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-reveals-the-top-10-most-played-steam-deck-titles-and-theyre-all-fully-verified/" target="_blank">A little while ago</a> Valve showed the current top 10 most played games on Steam Deck and now we have an update on what people are currently playing.</p>
<p>Shared via the official <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1554912282387173376" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account these are the top 10 over the last week, sorted by the daily average user counts:</p>
<ul>
<li>MultiVersus</li>
<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
<li>Stray</li>
<li>ELDEN RING</li>
<li>No Man's Sky</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
<li>MONSTER HUNTER RISE</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty amazing to see the likes of Vampire Survivors continue to stick in the top 10. Who would have thought a tiny little and rather simplistic indie game could keep on going like this? Vampire Survivors has managed to hit over 110,000 user reviews on Steam now, with an Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p>
<p>Not surprising to see MultiVersus there either, given that it's currently a top 10 game on Steam overall and worked right away at release and even before during the Beta as I showed previously:</p>

      <title>Valve teams with Komodo to bring the Steam Deck to Asia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some huge news for the future of the Steam Deck, as Valve has announced a teaming up with Komodo for the release of the Steam Deck in Asia. This is absolutely massive considering the size of the potential playerbase there, and the continued expansion only continue to show how all-in Valve are with this device.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We hope that gamers in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan agree with us that the performance and design of the Steam Deck makes it a great way to play the games they know and love," said Gabe Newell, President and CEO of Valve.</p>
<p>"We are very excited to be working with Komodo to bring Steam Deck to Asia. We have worked with the team at Komodo for years, and we have high confidence that they'll help us make customers very happy," says Greg Coomer of Valve.</p>
<p>"We are honored to deliver Steam Deck to gamers in Asia, and look forward to showcasing it and our first in-house game in Kyoto this weekend and at Tokyo Game Show next month," said Ricky Uy, CEO of Komodo.</p>
<p>Reservations for Asia will use a different reservation queue, so it will not affect anywhere else.</p>
<p>The first units are targeted to arrive in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan late this year which can be ordered from the dedicated Steam Deck site on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp" target="_blank">Komodo</a>. It will start off with Japan with additional units going on to Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan "in the weeks immediately following". Not only that, Valve also plans to be at BitSummit and the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Starting prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ľ59,800 in Japan</li>
<li>NT$ 13,380 in Taiwan</li>
<li>HK$ 3,288 in Hong Kong</li>
<li>KRW 589,000 in Korea</li>
</ul>
<p>From the site, it looks like Asia will be getting a slightly different type of carrying case too:</p>

      <title>Space Bandit is a top-down shooter with slick tunes and a Hotline Miami vibe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Bandit is a new Native Linux top-down shooter where you're running through cramped corridors on some space ship. It's got a whole lot of style and some great tunes too. Honestly, it firmly gives off vibes similar to Hotline Miami, only with a sci-fi setting and it's just as crazy at times.</p>
<p>It's now in Early Access, although this is just a finishing-up job as the developer said there's no missing content as it's basically complete but they want feedback before saying it's truly finished. The premise here is simple: you're a gun smuggler and you got ripped off, now you're out for revenge. It's ridiculously fast once the action gets going, but mostly it gives you a moment to think around the start of each section on how you wish to tear through it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cJmyGeQKOWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3942710516d52f7ca5383e26abbed1a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cJmyGeQKOWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has some pretty good AI that will actually attempt to take you down and not just run blindly at you firing, and that's part of the selling point. The developer actually says the AI is "madly advanced and challenging" and that the AI will "work together to flank you, they'll call out your position to each other, they'll revive each other and generally make you suffer". I can definitely attest to the suffering part, I lost count of my deaths some time ago.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Brutal (one hit kill) twin stick shooter gameplay.</li>
<li>Hilariously clever fun AI that doesn't just run at you like an idiot.</li>
<li>Teleporting... THROUGH PEOPLE.</li>
<li>Exploding barrels everywhere.</li>
<li>4 Proceduraly generated zones and roguelike stuff to keep things fresh.</li>
<li>4 unique no bullet sponge bosses.</li>
<li>Crazy weapons like the Rail Gun that shots through walls.</li>
<li>Full mouse, keyboard and controller support.</li>
<li>Kicking enemies when they're already dead because they could always be deader.</li>
<li>A fine professional business colleague that chain smokes and spouts conspiracy theories.</li>
<li>Shooting people out windows into the void of space.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Works <em>great</em> on desktop and on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435470/Space_Bandit/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge gets a nice big stability update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is an absolutely fantastic beat 'em up throwback and now perhaps even better, with a big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361510/view/3362518358054122480" target="_blank">stability update</a> out now!</p>
<p>With this update they've been focusing on making the core game feel better, with lots of niggles being fixed up. For the Steam Deck, they also added in Deck-specific input glyphs as a nice cosmetic tweak. The online play also had two additions with a message to tell you if you're kicked, and not letting people play mismatched versions to prevent problems.</p>
<p>As for fixes, there's loads actually and the online play received the most with many fixes to client-side issues with things not happening as they should, like lag during boss fights sometimes just breaking it entirely or game clients ignoring enemy grab cancellation and lots of little improvements like that. Online play also has better detection of when all players are ready, better transitions between stages and more.</p>
<p>Performance should be improved too as they're now preloading all enemies, Dizzy players are no longer invincible and in story mode pressing continue no longer forces you through how to play. Some players noticed audio issues too, which should be solved!</p>

      <title>The 30th update for Dead Cells is out now as &#39;Enter the Panchaku&#39; </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enter the Panchaku is the latest big update to the rather great game Dead Cells, continuing to expand the game in a number of ways and tweak existing features. For those that don't know somehow — Dead Cells is a rogue-lite, metroidvania inspired action-platformer.</p>
<p>With this update they've added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Weapon: Panchaku - Two pans tied together by a string, the perfect DIY weapon to tear through the island!</li>
<li>New Outfit: Bobby Outfit - A new outfit inspired by the Beheaded's design from the Dead Cells trailers, flaming head included.</li>
<li>New crossover content with Soul Knight including the Magic Bow that fires 5 slowly-moving homing arrows, the Knight's Outfit and a new lore room.</li>
<li>New Custom Mode Option: Legendaries Only - Turns all weapons found in the run into legendary ones.</li>
<li>You can now pet your Pets when you are in transition areas, by holding interact next to them!</li>
<li>Lots of weapon and Legendary balancing changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I must admit, when reading their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3383909822377684031" target="_blank">announcement</a> their NFT line almost had me. Cheeky. New gameplay trailer below too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zlPJBqtiZKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4ed78764dc80fd5c34df627311cfb78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zlPJBqtiZKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also put a reminder about their new roadmap, which will see Dead Cells gain updates and new content for what looks like at least another year yet. So there's plenty more to come including a boss rush mode and many surprises they're not yet revealing to us.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi 4 gets a graphics bump with Vulkan 1.2 conformance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you still enjoying your Raspberry Pi 4? Well, there's a graphics bump coming thanks to all the work in the drivers with it hitting Vulkan 1.2 conformance.</p>
<p>Writing in an official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/vulkan-update-version-1-2-conformance-for-raspberry-pi-4/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Eben Upton noted that they continue to press ahead with improving Vulkan support since OpenGL is rather old now and Vulkan is just the future. The update isn't available yet but people from open source consulting firm <a href="https://www.igalia.com/" target="_blank">Igalia</a> have been working on it, with Vulkan 1.2 conformance hit and merged upstream into Mesa ready for a future Raspberry Pi OS update.</p>
<p>An example they showed is that the Deferred Shadows Sample from Sasha Willems is now working:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2280669851659528592gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2280669851659528592gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What does having proper support for Vulkan 1.2 mean? Well, more advanced and modern features of Vulkan should see more apps and games working on the Raspberry Pi 4! In addition to Vulkan 1.2, work has also been ongoing to support various extensions and Vulkan 1.3 along with bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p><em>Support for Android has also been improving too with <a href="https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/" target="_blank">unofficial builds</a> of LineageOS.</em></p>

      <title>OBS Studio 28.0 Beta 1 brings Linux improvements, lots of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> is getting another major version bump with OBS Studio 28.0 Beta 1 now available for testing. Lots of big features included in this one, plus some nice Linux client updates.</p>
<p>A major new addition is support for 10-bit and HDR Video Encoding Support, which is sadly limited on Linux (and macOS). For Linux, it's mainly because we don't really have HDR yet but now that OBS has it in, once various parts of Linux are upgraded to support HDR hopefully it won't be too much to get it into OBS then too.</p>
<p>Some major technical changes too like upgrading the internals to Qt 6, since the version OBS was using is no longer supported. So now they have access to the latest features and fixes to keep improving the UI. This does mean that a bunch of plugins will need updating which the OBS team said they're working on with the community, plus some older operating systems are no longer supported like Windows 7 &amp; 8, macOS 10.13 &amp; 10.14, Ubuntu 18.04 and all 32-bit operating systems.</p>
<p>Other new features and tweaks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added obs-websocket 5.0 as a first-party plugin.</li>
<li>A new default theme.</li>
<li>Added native SRT/RIST outputs.</li>
<li>The ability to automatically split recordings based on file size or duration, or manually via hotkey.</li>
<li>Support for sending chat messages to YouTube from within OBS.</li>
<li>Accessibility section added to the settings window.</li>
<li>CEF (Chromium) updated to version 103 (5060).</li>
<li>Image sources will now honor the rotation in the EXIF metadata</li>
<li>Hotkeys now require strict modifiers (exact modifier matches)</li>
<li>Significantly improved reconnecting when streaming disconnects, including lowering the default reconnect delay to 2 seconds</li>
<li>+ loads more tweaks</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific to Linux these changes made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switched rendering on Linux from GLX to EGL, which should result in a better experience</li>
<li>Added support for the H264 Format in the Linux V4L2 (video capture device) source</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where right-side modifiers wouldn't be detected on Linux</li>
</ul>

      <title>DXVK 1.10.3 out with work for Halo Infinite plus better Stray performance for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> is a Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer used in Proton, to help run Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck. A new release version 1.10.3 is out now.</p>
<p>This is a "minor maintenance release" readying the project for the next version of Proton. While the team mentioned recently that much newer drivers would soon be needed, that's not the case for this release since it's just a minor one. That said, as always, more compatibility and performance improvements is welcome.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for shared fences (PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2608" target="_blank">#2608</a>). This is needed for videos in <strong>Halo Infinite</strong> to work, alongside corresponding wine and vkd3d-proton patches.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced in 1.10.2 that would cause rendering issues in various D3D11 games, including <strong>Prey</strong>, <strong>Bioshock Infinite</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2757" target="_blank">#2757</a>), and some others.</li>
<li><strong>Need For Speed 3</strong>: Fixed Modern Patch not working (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/1699" target="_blank">#1699</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Blade</strong>: Fixed alpha test issues (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2745" target="_blank">#2745</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Stray</strong>: Enabled <code class="inline-code">d3d11.ignoreGraphicsBarriers</code> option to work around some GPU-bound performance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Ys Origin</strong>: Work around stutter with the game's built-in FPS limiter (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2750" target="_blank">#2750</a>, PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2754" target="_blank">#2754</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>As a reminder: you can upgrade the version of DXVK used in Proton, without waiting on a new release. To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of DXVK 1.10.3. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. Do so at your own risk but it's usually harmless. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Check out the new Scrabdackle demo, a scribbly hand-drawn Zelda-like adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Go on a bit of adventure as a Wizard in Scrabdackle, you just have to find your wand first. This scribbly-art hand-drawn adventure is ridiculously charming. Funded on Kickstarter and coming out next year, the developer has been toiling away at the code and artwork over the last year to bring out a much improved new demo that just landed.</p>
<p>With Native Linux support planned at release, along with support already hooked up with the new demo, it's something you definitely need to try. The artwork really is great and the quirky atmosphere it gives off leaves a lasting impression. Check out the new demo teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c3-nxqhlbLQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5cd92681d32bf52d7f55897837576eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c3-nxqhlbLQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Inspired by classics like Link's Awakening, An Untitled Story, and Hollow Knight, Scrabdackle is a project designed, animated, programmed, and scored by one developer wanting to make a world worth getting lost in."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expansive, non-linear world</strong> allows for high replayability. The map can be navigated in any order on any playthrough. Try a different route every time!</li>
<li><strong>Secret characters, areas, storylines and oddities</strong> hidden where you least expect them. The more you explore, the more you’ll be rewarded with unexpected and delightful encounters.</li>
<li>Tough-but-fair bosses with <strong>tight, challenging combat</strong>. With some practice, you can walk away from any fight unscathed. Or, toggle assist settings to define your own challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Unique storybook visual style</strong> made with hand-drawn line art and a pixelated brush.</li>
<li>Optional dialogue that <strong>doesn’t take control away</strong> from the player. Just walk away mid-conversation, and characters will wave you off.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your official wizardly notebook</strong> by scrying new creatures and documenting your findings! Review your field logs any time to see the world in closer detail!</li>
<li><strong>Charming original soundtrack</strong> with new tracks for every corner of the world.</li>
<li>Tons of spells and relics to master. <strong>Swap magic powers on the fly</strong> to face any type of challenge any way you want!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Frogun is a 3D platformer with the soul of a Nintendo 64 game </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frogun is a brand new Native Linux release, designed in the spirit of the PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 era, this is a proper classic 3D platformer. Note: key provided by their PR team.</p>
<p>Developed by Molegato with publishing help from Top Hat Studios, you play the role of Renata who has an unusual weapon — a Frog, that's also their best friend. It's a thoroughly quirky premise and incredibly charming. For fans of collectathons, this is something you will likely enjoy. Starting off with a sweet little semi-animated intro video, you learn that Renata's parents appear to have gone missing so you take it upon yourself to go off on an adventure to find them.</p>
<p>Official release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EKrKy7LpYZc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2840e0ecdcd596a206f1c95391302e28.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EKrKy7LpYZc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This really is a collectathon through and through. Every level presents you with numerous coins, emeralds, notes and more to collect. Since it's a 3D platformer, you also have to pay attention to the world around you flicking the viewpoint around to ensure you're not missing out any secrets of which there's a good few to find. Not only that, you also gain extra coins if you manage to complete levels within a certain time limit so it is pushing you a little to be fast but you can easily repeat levels so it's not really a problem and it doesn't penalise you for not getting a specific time either.</p>
<p>Your Frogun is a fun feature to set it apart from other similar games too. Not only is your little froggy friend your gun to sucker up various creatures to move them out of your way, or throw a pot or two at them, it's also your way to traverse obstacles and reach different areas. When running around you can fire your frog's tongue to stick to surfaces to pull you across. If you finding sticking to a wall difficult, you can also hold down a button to have a more pin-point aim ability.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore colorful levels full of crispy pixelated ruins, freezing snow caps, and scorching lava swamps in a modern representation of the lowpoly aesthetic</li>
<li>From levers to buttons, lethal traps, and adorable enemies, there are countless ways to use your Frogun to navigate the world!</li>
<li>Race Renata's rival and fight big bosses</li>
<li>Find secret areas or shortcuts by mastering the grappling mechanics! How nimble are you?</li>
<li>Collect emblems by fulfilling level challenges, and discover the stories of other adventurers through hidden diary notes</li>
<li>Visit the hatter to trade your coins for hats, bestiary entries, game art, and more</li>
<li>A posable photo mode to let you show off your creativity</li>
<li>Unlockable 2-player duel arenas to challenge your friends!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice family friendly game for fans of the classics, and a good one to introduce a younger audience into it all too. Overall most of it is pretty easy and accessible too, except when you get to the racing where it can be a little frustrating to get through. For the most part though, it sets out to provide exactly what it advertises, a colourful and inviting throwback. My time with it played on Steam Deck with the Native build was great too, all worked nicely.</p>
<p>This is another game that was funded with help from people on Kickstarter, so it's nice to see it release without big issues or long delays!</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/frogun" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1575470/Frogun/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>BLASTRONAUT is a fresh mining game full of explosions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love exploration and mining? Want to do it with many explosions? Check out the new Native Linux release of BLASTRONAUT.</p>
<p>"It is a dangerous but lucrative job. Explore this vast procedurally generated world with your jetpack. Extract the minerals with an explosive gel. Expand your mining platform. But most importantly: stay alive."</p>
<p>It recently entered Early Access and it has very quickly won me over. A core gameplay loop that's quite satisfying, with you exploring deep below the surface and blowing everything up for resources, to then quickly blast back up to the surface with your jetpack to sell those resources and upgrade. There's plenty of games that have you go mining but not many do so <em>explosively</em> like this.</p>
<p>Here's some recently captured footage of it running on a Steam Deck and it works beautifully:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3iZHhnvxoCo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/58f2db3f7e39e3a136ced3c77a7785a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3iZHhnvxoCo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite excited to watch this one develop. A really great idea and a shiny gem in the making here. I have a feeling it's another that's going to sucker away many hours of my time.</p>

      <title>ScummVM 2.6.0 out now with more retro game support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keeping a great many classics alive with new game engines, <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> version 2.6.0 is officially out now.</p>
<p>This release brings eight newly supported games across 6 game engines, so there's plenty to be excited about for this very important open source game preservation tech. Newly supported includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanitarium</li>
<li>Hades Challenge</li>
<li>Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six</li>
<li>The 11th Hour</li>
<li>Clandestiny</li>
<li>Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)</li>
<li>Uncle Henry's Playhouse</li>
<li>Wetlands</li>
<li>Chewy: Esc from F5</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course they're not just focused on getting new games running but fixing up older supported games too, and they've got numerous bug fixes and improvements there across various games engines to improve the likes of Simon the Sorcerer 1 &amp; 2, Titanic, Sherlock, Backyard Baseball 2003, Monkey Island 1 &amp; 2, Full Throttle, The Dig and The Curse of Monkey Island and many more.</p>
<p>A big addition to the UI this release is a new icon grid overview, along with some shiny artwork to go with it. Sounds like a nice way to show off and browse your collection.</p>

      <title>Free first-person strategy shooter Unvanquished version 0.53 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source first-person strategy shooter Unvanquished has a new Beta release, which is quite a big one too overall on what's changed. Don't let the Beta tag fool you, it's a fully playable game, they're just not ready to call it the finished product yet. Over a year since their last release!</p>
<p>With 0.53 Beta they continued working to improve the AI in many areas, so they should now be far less boring to play with. They also replaced their whole UI / HUD framework with one that is actually still maintained helping them keep up to date, some bits of the UI will also look better as a result.</p>
<p>You will also see the Parpax map had a complete overhaul:</p>

<p>For the AI, what actually changed? A lot! They're smarter about when to flee, human bots can now use grenades, human bots are smarter about what equipment they buy and pathfinding improvements. Alien bots are also smarter about evolving, so they won't die instantly from low health, they're also a bit smarter about when they choose to evolve before fighting.</p>
<p>Naturally tons of bugs were fixed over the last year too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is still a lot of work for us to do: many AI improvements are still possible, we still need to update the GUI/HUD lib we use to its latest version, and to implement better GUIs with it, and most importantly we still hope to replace our old NaCl integration with Wasm, which would allow us to support more hardware architectures like ARM systems.</p>
<p>We also know the gameplay is not perfect, but we believe we improved the game a lot in that year of development.</p>

      <title>Inspired by classic JRPGs, Shadows of Adam gets improved Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shadows of Adam is a JRPG inspired retro game from Something Classic Games that released back in 2017 and a small update came recently to improve it on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The patch was small simply improving support for running it on Linux distributions that have kernel 5.x and upwards (the Steam Deck is kernel 5.13). So it might not be some mind-blowing change but it's fantastic to see developers of all sizes keep their games nicely maintained. Also a good excuse to highlight another indie gem!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4jPO8BRNRTM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a683570000a813ac00d1d7550d45bbc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4jPO8BRNRTM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compelling Character Driven Story:</strong> Shadows of Adam’s story is one with deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon.</li>
<li><strong>A Strategic AP Management Battle System:</strong> AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful Visuals:</strong> Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the SNES-era.</li>
<li><strong>Original Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks:</strong> An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire that’s inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melody and emotional connection.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam continues rising — highest for years again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out their usual monthly Steam Hardware &amp; Software <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=combined" target="_blank">Survey</a> and it's looking like good news for Linux and Steam Deck once again.</p>
<p>We've seen the user share rise up to <strong>1.23%</strong>, making it the highest point in multiple years (again). If we use Valve's last monthly active user count, that points the monthly active Linux user count somewhere around 1,623,600. See more on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>. Linux has remained at 1% or above for at least a full year now too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7666733111659439925gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7666733111659439925gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>According to the survey when filtering just to Linux, here are the most popular distributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 13.87% +2.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 11.40% +1.29%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 9.78% -0.12%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 9.28% -0.45%</li>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 7.60% +0.02%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 6.29% -0.16%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org 21.08.14 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.29% -0.76%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.90% +0.11%</li>
<li>Other 31.60% -2.36%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So we're seeing Valve's SteamOS now make up 7.6% of the Linux gaming audience on Steam, which is a pretty good early showing for the Steam Deck. In terms of hardware, on the Linux side the Steam Deck appears to be the most popular device as it's now top of the list of GPUs used too.</p>

      <title>Stealth-action game Republique is now FREE and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Consider this your quick tip of the week, as Republique from developer Camouflaj is now free to keep on Steam and it's also Steam Deck Verified! The developer has reached their 10 year anniversary as a studio, so they've put Republique free as it was their first game. A nice little gesture.</p>
<p>"Help a woman named Hope escape from a totalitarian state in this stealth thriller that explores the perils of government surveillance in the Internet Age. Hack into the nation’s elaborate network, take control, and guide Hope to freedom across five episodes "</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at it working on Steam Deck. Looks like the Verified tick is nice and correct on this one, it works really quite nicely right out of the box:</p>

      <title>No need to wait on Valve, the Steam Deck Docking Station from JSAUX is great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While many will no doubt wait on Valve for the official Steam Deck Dock, a lot of hardware vendors are coming out with their own versions. JSAUX are one of them and they sent over their Docking Station for Steam Deck for me to take a look at.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is a full PC, you might want to hook it up to a proper monitor to use the desktop mode or just on your big TV and this will allow you to do just that without fussing around.</p>
<p>JSAUX actually sent over both their original model and the newer upgraded version (<a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">HB0603</a>). Testing both, I've come away very impressed. Honestly, at this point, you probably don't need to wait on Valve for the official one because the Upgraded Docking Station for Steam Deck from JSAUX does pretty much everything you need and it works a treat. While you could go for any number of USB-C hubs from the likes of Amazon, there's something special about a proper dock like this designed and tested to work nicely directly with the Deck.</p>
<p>Testing it extensively with my TV and my PC monitor, I've really not had much trouble at all. Most of my issues were just software quirks on the SteamOS side, and as Valve continue to improve the docked experience with SteamOS upgrades over time the quirks will be improved and they've done work on that a few times recently.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15236383271659370363gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15236383271659370363gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12983927321659370352gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12983927321659370352gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The upgraded model (which I ended up sticking with) features gigabit ethernet, USB-C for the charging, three USB-A 3.0 ports and HDMI out with 4K 60hz support. The charging is full-power too, so no problems leaving it on charging through the Docking Station while you're using it.</p>
<p>How good is the ethernet? Does the upgraded model have a better speed like it says? Absolutely, you're going to have no issues with ethernet speed on the higher model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7678529301659780077gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7678529301659780077gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the most part, the design is close to perfect. While it might not be perhaps as slick as the Nintendo Switch dock with you just sticking it straight in, the design of the Steam Deck doesn't really allow that. JSAUX went with an easy approach here though. Just place the Deck into the gap at the front, then pull over the attached USB-C cable that fits perfectly. With some great anti-slip pads included, the Deck won't be moving while sat inside it. Great build quality too, it looks and feels pretty premium. My only real gripe with the design is the ethernet being on the side, it would have been better if that was on the back too as you can see the ethernet poking out.</p>
<p>Really, there's not a whole lot I can actually say about this without padding it out unnecessarily and that is absolutely a good thing. Everything works great. It's a simple device with a simple purpose and is exactly what you want to nicely rest the deck while powering / charging and gaining a few more ports.</p>
<p>We still don't know how much the Valve model will cost, and it won't exactly offer a great many advantages over this. Sure it has an added DisplayPort and a bump from USB 3 to 3.1 but I imagine a lot of people won't actually need that. So really JSAUX are positioned well here with pretty reasonable pricing too.</p>
<p>You can buy each model at the links below. Really, just get the upgraded model though unless you're really penny-pinching:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Original </a>-  $39.99 USD</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded</a> -  $49.99 USD</li>
</ul>
<p>I can happily recommend it. It's now one of my favourite Deck accessories from anywhere.</p>

      <title>Steam gets support for Nintendo Online classic controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/141152" target="_blank">released</a> an update for the main Steam client, which amongst other things brings support in Steam Input for the Nintendo Online classic controllers. These are the special controllers Nintendo offers for playing their classics on Nintendo Switch, although Steam having support for them makes sure they have a whole lot more life.</p>
<p>The support includes the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis controllers.</p>
<p>Not only that Steam also now supports the Qanba Obsidian and Dragon Arcade Joysticks, the HORI Fighting Stick mini 4 and it has improved rumble emulation on DualSense Wireless Controllers with updated firmware.</p>
<p>A bunch of other fixes came in too like the Steam Overlay not working with Vulkan 1.3 applications, a Steam Cloud issue where an app launch would stall if there are sync conflicts but Cloud Sync is disabled for the game or account, a fix for resource usage of chat and web browser in Steam Overlay when hidden, a fix for micro-stutter in some situations where Steamworks API calls could be briefly blocked by Steam client log file, a fix for crashes with Vulkan games using the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library extension and more.</p>
<p>Specific to Linux these fixes were also released:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed resource usage of chat and browsers when Steam client is minimized/closed</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Overlay "Force Quit" not working for some native Linux games</li>
<li>Fixed some games being unable to create desktop shortcuts</li>
<li>Fixed the Steam client triggering "split lock" warnings</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve bans devs from adding review scores and awards on Steam store assets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of places where developers can have their game logo across Steam, and some developers have been going pretty overboard with noisy images filled with extras. Valve is putting a stop to it.</p>
<p>Announced in a Steamworks <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/6232436041608114695" target="_blank">blog post</a> Valve mentioned how they've "noticed more text, award logos, and even review scores being included by game developers in their graphical asset images" and that "some game logos themselves have become so small that it's hard for players to tell what the name of the game is" resulting in various graphical assets that are so noisy they're "distracting and hard to read". They also noted in most cases it's all in English too "isolating much of the Steam audience that doesn't speak English".</p>
<p>Hard to really argue with that, as a Steam customer it has become something of a nuisance. The example they included shows a small part of the issue:</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5238836511659353479gol1.jpg"/>There's plenty that did it far worse than their funny example images, but obviously Valve doesn't want to call out developers directly.</p>
<p>New rules come into effect on September 1st, with these clarifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No review scores of any kind, including Steam reviews or external news sources</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No award names, symbols, or logos</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No discount marketing copy (eg. no "On Sale Now" or "Up to 90% off" text)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No text or imagery promoting a different product. This includes no marketing of sequels or other titles in the same franchise</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No other miscellaneous text</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few little exceptions of course, like adjusting the images to tastefully note the latest update which is never really a problem. Valve added a special bit for developers to override an image for one month.</p>
<p>Some developers aren't happy about it though, as it has been another small way to perhaps pull in a bit more attention, with images that have awards some Steam customers might be more likely to click and take a look. I get that developers want to do a little showing off but quite a number really took it too far and Steam has dedicated parts of store pages to list awards and other things.</p>
<p>In other Steam news, Valve has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">increased production of the Steam Deck</a>!</p>

      <title>Mojang rolls out Player Chat Reporting into Minecraft Java</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-19-1" target="_blank">Java Edition 1.19.1</a> is out now and it comes with some controversial changes, that many players are not particularly happy about.</p>
<p>The first major change is the addition of player reporting, if they send abusive message in the game chat. The system allows you to report specific people on servers and select multiple messages to include, plus add some comments. From there, Mojang / Microsoft moderators will look over reports and deal with them. It applies to everyone, even private servers. Linking together with that is another change to the text chat. With their new secure chat system, it will put a note by the chat for each message that was not sent through it or if the server somehow tampered with it.</p>
<p>Mojang say people won't be banned for swearing but it's more aimed at "hate speech, bullying, harassment, sexual solicitation, or making true threats to others". If you get banned it won't affect playing single-player.</p>
<p>Naturally, there's already mods to get around this like the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports" target="_blank">No Chat Reports</a> mod that claims to strip out the signatures attached to chat messages, making them "impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CSdQ61dEizI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4eef611dc22eaa172bd87d48b7532545.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CSdQ61dEizI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In case you missed it, Mojang also recently said <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/mojang-say-no-to-nfts-and-blockchain-with-minecraft/" target="_blank">no to NFTs and blockchain</a> in Minecraft.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming overlay MangoHud version 0.6.8 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> is probably one of my favourite open source projects giving Linux gamers a fancy HUD to display various performance metrics in a nice overlay. Version 0.6.8 is out now!</p>
<p>It actually comes in two parts: there's MangoHud which is the generic overlay for most users, then there's MangoApp which is designed to be used directly with Gamescope (like on the Steam Deck). MangoHud can give you an FPS counter, frame timings, CPU and GPU temperature monitoring, battery remaining, RAM use, VRAM use and much more.</p>
<p>What does it look like? Well, any time you see the performance overlay in the corner on a Steam Deck, that's it in action. Something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1878409321659346755gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1878409321659346755gol1.jpg"/></a>That's set on the highest output level.</em></p>
<p>Here's what's new in version 0.6.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MangoHud</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bumped layer api version to 1.3.0<br/>
	This fixes MangoHud not loading with latest DXVK</li>
<li>Bumped meson to 0.60</li>
<li>Only install data files if <code class="inline-code">include_doc</code> option is set</li>
<li>Allow use of system nlohmann_json dependency</li>
<li>Added metainfo file</li>
<li>Fixed <code class="inline-code">table_columns</code> not working as expected</li>
<li>Minor adjustments to hud elements and imgui</li>
<li>Convert from <code class="inline-code">printf's</code> to SPDLOG</li>
<li>Added <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_LOG_LEVEL</code> env variable<br/>
	it takes <code class="inline-code">off</code>, <code class="inline-code">info</code>, <code class="inline-code">err</code>, <code class="inline-code">warn</code></li>
<li>Added StarCitizen_Launcher.exe and InsurgencyEAC.exe to blacklist</li>
<li>Added FCAT support</li>
<li>Disabled <code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery_icon</code> by default</li>
<li>Generalize control over socket so it works with OpenGL as well</li>
<li>AMDGPU: fixed gfx and cpu power metrics being parsed incorrectly</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_only</code> disables <code class="inline-code">legacy_layout</code> by default</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MangoApp</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added man page</li>
<li>Install MangoApp layer to libdir_mangohud</li>
<li>Prevent resizing of the MangoApp window when using <code class="inline-code">fps_only</code>.<br/>
	This prevents the hud from flickering when number of digits increase or decrease</li>
<li>Fixed issues caused by us not releasing the XAtom.<br/>
	Namely preventing other apps from using the gamescope overlay and sometimes causing a black box to be drawn</li>
<li>Disabled vulkan layer<br/>
	It was not working properly so we disabled it until fixed as to not cause confusion.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Razer make some pretty fancy hardware but, like a lot of vendors, don't exactly support Linux directly and so the <a href="https://openrazer.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenRazer</a> project helps you out there. It's an open source driver and user-space daemon to control Razer lighting and other features on Linux, with version 3.4.0 officially out now.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the latest version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New device support</p>
<ul>
<li>Razer DeathAdder V2 X HyperSpeed</li>
<li>Razer Viper V2 Pro</li>
<li>Razer Huntsman Mini Analog</li>
<li>Razer DeathAdder 3.5G Black</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve error handling in all drivers</li>
<li>Clean up driver code</li>
<li>Add additional support for Razer Huntsman V2 functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove non-existent scroll wheel options from DeathAdder Essential (2021)</li>
<li>Fix media buttons for Huntsman V2</li>
<li>Fix missing device_remove_file for Pro Click</li>
<li>Fix persistence saving for DPI X-only devices, like DeathAdder 3.5G</li>
<li>udev: Check 'razer' as well as 'hid-generic'</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To help you manage your devices you will also likely need a proper UI. There's a few available to try like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a>, <a href="https://github.com/z3ntu/RazerGenie" target="_blank">RazerGenie</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gabmus/razerCommander" target="_blank">razerCommander</a> and <a href="http://bithatch.co.uk/snake.html" target="_blank">Snake</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux 5.19 is out now, Torvalds released it using an Apple silicon MacBook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest kernel release is out with <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/7/31/295" target="_blank">Linux 5.19</a> and showing just how far Linux support for the newer Apple silicon MacBooks has come, Linus Torvalds did the release on one!</p>
<p>Writing in the release notes, Torvalds mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a personal note, the most interesting part here is that I did the release (and am writing this) on an arm64 laptop. It's something I've been waiting for for a _loong_ time, and it's finally reality, thanks to the Asahi team. We've had arm64 hardware around running Linux for a long time, but none of it has really been usable as a development platform until now.</p>
<p>It's the third time I'm using Apple hardware for Linux development - I did it many years ago for powerpc development on a ppc970 machine. And then a decade+ ago when the Macbook Air was the only real thin-and-lite around. And now as an arm64 platform.</p>
<p>Not that I've used it for any real work, I literally have only been doing test builds and boots and now the actual release tagging. But I'm trying to make sure that the next time I travel, I can travel with this as a laptop and finally dogfooding the arm64 side too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Torvalds also mentioned the next kernel release is likely to be the big 6.0.</em></p>
<p>For those that don't know, the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" target="_blank">Asahi Linux</a> team have been dedicated to working on Linux support for the newer Arm hardware from Apple. It's come a long way in a short amount of time, with Apple M2 support only just landing in July 2022.</p>
<p>As always for kernel releases there's absolutely tons of changes, the vast majority of gamers don't really need to know about apart from the usual additions of new hardware support, bug fixes, security improvements and so on. This includes better Apple M1, Wacom hardware support upgrades, Lenovo ThinkPad TrackPoint II support, improvements for Intel laptops when in sleep mode, NTFS driver improvements, exFAT performance improvements and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Valve speeds up Steam Deck production some more, all existing reservations this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219974913052" target="_blank">has announced</a> that they've sorted out various issues with their Steam Deck supply chain, so they will get through reservations much faster than expected now. This means a lot of people will be bumped up the list a bit getting their Steam Deck purchase email a lot sooner.</p>
<p>Everyone who has an existing reservation will get their purchase email this year. So many who were in "Q4 or later" were bumped up to the Q3 window and Valve said everyone else is now sitting properly inside Q4.</p>
<p>Any new reservations will be in the Q4 list but if those fill up, naturally they spill over into next year. Either way it's good news, as Valve can get Steam Deck units shipping a lot sooner than before.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly what has changed, as Valve only said that "the supply chain shortfalls that affect Steam Deck are gradually clearing up, and we're continuing to ramp production, so we're able to produce more Decks faster than ever before"</p>
<p>Valve also said to expect "more news soon".</p>
<p>This is awesome news, I'm excited to see more of you getting your units. Every single device shipping is a new potential Linux gamer!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yars: Recharged is the latest remake from Atari with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox and it's launching on August 23rd with Native Linux support.

<li>Arcade mode: Boss rush of 30 enemies. It’s not endless, but it’s VERY difficult to get to the end of this mode. Three hits and you die, but don’t worry, that hit-count resets when moving to the next fight.</li>
<li>Missions: 30 unique, challenging bosses and only one life to beat each. Like Gravitar: Recharged, there’s one global leaderboard for mission mode, so you need to be on your game. Bosses pose a challenge, so you will need to take them head on with a barrage of bullets or start with the smaller, Minor Cores first and work your way to the boss.</li>
<li>Power-Ups: Minor Cores will drop power-ups when attached. Shoot in all directions at once, rapid fire, explosive shots, or fire a railgun – the nature of the power up is tied to the nature of the core that dropped it.</li>
<li>Co-op: Yars: Recharged is a local co-op game in both arcade and mission mode, a big change from the original and a ton of fun for you and a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019990/Yars_Recharged/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Modern Diablo game engine devilutionX sees new release, how to get it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you want to play the classic Diablo RPG? Well, not only does <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">GOG</a> have it and the Hellfire expansion but the Native Linux devilutionX game engine can make it even better. Here's how to get it working on Steam Deck (and Linux desktop!).</p>
<p>Why would you want to use devilutionX? Well, it's constantly updated to improve playing Diablo for modern platforms! It just keeps on getting better. Many advanced features like high FPS support, more resolution support, skippable movies, quick casting, better multiplayer, UI improvements, better saved games and the list goes on.</p>
<p>How to:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, you're going to want to install the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> as that makes managing games from GOG <em>really</em> easy. You can get it easily as a Flatpak from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, and on the Steam Deck from the Discover app.</li>
<li>Sign into GOG with Heroic and download Diablo.</li>
<li>Next up, download the AppImage from the devilutionX GitHub <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases" target="_blank">releases page</a>.</li>
<li>Make the AppImage executable. Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Permissions -&gt; Tick the "Is executable" box.</li>
<li>Move the AppImage into the folder where Diablo is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, now it will run via the AppImage and detect the content properly and work. However you can also add it to Steam, to launch it directly there.</p>
<p>How to add to Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your Steam Library, go to the top menu where it says Games -&gt; Add a Non-Steam game.</li>
<li>Find where you installed Diablo and select All Files from the bottom of the file picker.</li>
<li>Select the devilutionX AppImage and add it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done! Now you can launch it from Steam and it works on Steam Deck in Gaming Mode nicely too.</p>
<p>Now here's all that in video form to give you a walkthrough and a quick bit of gameplay just to show it working:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tqu_BNGgxDA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ba01beb8d09fa328dcba20fe59652f0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tqu_BNGgxDA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for devilutionX, it's had a few massive upgrades recently that massively improved gamepad support, updated translations, improved game stability, added a new settings menu, improved multiplayer and so much more. It's really coming along nicely.</p>
<p>Remember you need to own Diablo, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">buy it from GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>OUTRIDERS officially gets a Playable Steam Deck rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for your next RPG-shooter hybrid with online co-op? OUTRIDERS from People Can Fly recently released the WORLDSLAYER expansion and it's now actually Playable on the Steam Deck (and Linux desktop too). Previously it had problems with Easy Anti-Cheat but that is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>Currently you <u>need</u> to set it <em>manually</em> to Proton Experimental (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">guide</a>), as a very recent update stopped it working on Proton 7 and if you have any problems, just ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library. I imagine very soon it will be re-verified and set properly to Proton Experimental so you won't have to do that.</p>
<p>The developer even <a href="https://twitter.com/Outriders/status/1549411774738432000" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a brief announcement video about the official Deck Playable status. It appears it's Playable and not Verified due to needing the on-screen keyboard to be opened manually (Steam + X).</p>
<p>Here's a look at it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzVuBV_zJgY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a48a10557c355e30256dd96d00ef282.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzVuBV_zJgY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I think I'm going to enjoy this one…</em></p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/outriders?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Just King blends Vampire Survivors action with Slay the Spire progression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just King is going to be my next game to be fixated on. It's ridiculously cheap and offers up gameplay where you keep wanting to come back for more. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Offering up combat that's perhaps a bit like what Vampire Survivors made popular again, with you running around facing off against waves of enemies. It's also an auto-battler, so you don't attack directly. Here though, you're protecting your little King with other classes of units surrounding them in a circle that you can manually move position around the King. It's some very clever design and looks great too.</p>
<p>After you beat a round, you then go through a Slay the Spire styled map where you pick a node to go through battles, random events and more. You also repeatedly get to change your roster of fighters that you build up like a little deck, upgrade them and more. It has a <em>lot</em> going for it and the price is great too at only £2.89.</p>
<p>Tested working great on my <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> laptop with Pop!_OS and works great on the Steam Deck too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ISSGWxMwCsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e5f01dd5f8c4d61c4c28cc7c3e1b84b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ISSGWxMwCsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently though it doesn't have <em>proper</em> controller support. You can enable a "twin stick mode" in the settings but it's not quite correct as only the left stick works for King movement, and then you get the Dpad for swapping around your guards. I preferred to keep it in mouse / keyboard mode on Steam Deck with the right stick or right thumbpad as a mouse as it worked quite well overall and i had no troubles with it. Hopefully though they will get proper controller support in.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Destroy tons of enemies using multiple gameplay styles</li>
<li>Move the party to engage or run from chaotic combat</li>
<li>Hire and upgrade awesome heroes in an auto-battler shop</li>
<li>Use 17 characters and their synergies to creates powerful combinations</li>
<li>Discover and wield many legendary items to boost your party</li>
<li>Fight deadly bosses to unlock new areas, enemies, heroes and mechanics</li>
<li>Defeat wave after wave after wave of hundreds of zone enemies</li>
<li>Endure environmental challenges across 3 different biomes</li>
<li>Be patient with the Bard, he's trying his best</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I am honestly loving these smaller indie games that keep appearing like this lately. Small, cheap, repeatable and a lot of fun. Now if you need me, I'm off for another round. I wouldn't be surprised if this quickly becomes a big hit, what an absolute gem.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059980/Just_King/" target="_blank">Just King on Steam</a>. Works out of the box with Proton 7. It is currently in Early Access with the developer expecting it to remain there for 6 months at a minimum.</p>

      <title>You can now play DOOM as the Cat from Stray</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes this is a real thing, DOOM modders will quite literally do anything and I'm here loving it. You can now play DOOM as the cat from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/run-around-a-cyberpunk-city-as-a-lost-cat-in-stray-out-now/" target="_blank">Stray</a>.</p>
<p>It's not the most in-depth mod out there and it's another mostly silly one, but still somewhat amusing to try out. Playing DOOM as a cat in third-person is not what I had in mind when starting my day that's for sure. The developer said they are planning numerous improvements and additions like multiplayer, more cats, more effects, more cat abilities like scratching and drinking, the actual Doomguy as a combat partner to pet you and more.</p>
<p>Check out the dev footage below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p-c0LchkzLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b75ecd7f8f8c5c36350016b30534e630.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p-c0LchkzLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To run it on Linux / Steam Deck you just need a copy of GZDoom installed, with a DOOM wad file in the correct folder. Download the zip file from the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stray-doom" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a> and place it next to your DOOM wad, this would usually be in:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">./config/gzdoom </code></p>
<p>Or if you've installed via Flatpak (like on a Steam Deck):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/strayDoom.v01.zip</code></p>
<p>Then run it (using terminal command as an example or use your favourite launcher) with:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">GZDoom -file strayDoom.v01.zip</code></p>
<p>Or if you've installed via Flatpak (like on a Steam Deck):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file strayDoom.v01.zip</code></p>

      <title>Wine manager app Bottles makes rolling back configs real easy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles is the free and open source app that allows you to easily manage Wine, the Windows compatibility layer on Steam Deck and Linux. Another <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2022.7.28/" target="_blank">new version</a> is live, with a whole new versioning system to help you roll back changes.</p>
<p>Their versioning system is part of what makes it unique and this is a huge advancement for the app. This new version allows you to basically have snapshots of each Bottle where things are installed, which includes the files inside and the main configuration of the Bottle itself so you can roll it back to a different point in time - perhaps before you broke it.</p>
<p>As they gave a demo in the below video when they installed a component and they restored to a previous state:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="astxMzyxk0E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8493235dabce36054e380a0abf6d7a58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/astxMzyxk0E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So with this new system, it allows you to install various Windows launchers, games and programs and mess about with them while also getting to restore the Bottle they're inside to a different state. Sounds incredibly useful for quickly testing various things.</p>
<p>More work has gone into the UI too, with the Library Mode now basically finished and they even implemented image covers taken from <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/" target="_blank">SteamGridDB</a> too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9543619411659027306gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9543619411659027306gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They said work is ongoing to allow custom covers, and manually picking one too if the one picked automatically from SteamGridDB is not what you want.</p>
<p>Main new additions includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New versioning system which allow versioning the whole bottle (also configuration)</li>
<li>Automatic versioning can now be toggled on and off</li>
<li>Exclude paths from versioning using patterns</li>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-27 has the Halo Infinite campaign and videos working on Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/you-can-now-get-halo-infinite-online-to-work-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">showed off Halo Infinite</a> running quite nicely online on the Steam Deck and now <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton 7-27</a> that just went up makes the process even smoother and the campaign and videos now work too. This is another great step forwards.</p>
<p>Note: GE-Proton (formerly Proton-GE), is a community-built version of Proton not controlled by Valve. Not to be confused with Proton Experimental, which is from Valve.</p>
<p>Here's the new steps to get Halo Infinite working on Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt into the Steam Deck Preview branch, if you don't see it then opt into the Beta on both options for the Client and OS</li>
<li>In desktop mode: download GE-Proton 7-27 info in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">previous guide</a> (using ProtonUp-Qt)</li>
<li>Set Halo Infinite to use GE-Proton7-27. Open Halo Infinite in your Steam Library and click the little Cog Icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3349564631659023973gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3349564631659023973gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7387406361659023972gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7387406361659023972gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The GE-Proton developer does mention that there will still be some issues, as the code to get it all working is very fresh. Right now honestly I wouldn't really recommend it, as the audio stutter is <em>very</em> distracting and there's still some noticeable graphical glitches but it's truly getting close now to being properly playable in all parts. I'll keep testing at each release to let you know when it's really good to go.</p>
<p>A bunch of other updates in GE-Proton 7-27 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added for Halo CE mod tools (confirmed working) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>protonfix added for Halo 2 mod tools (still has issues) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>protonfix added for Halo 3 mod tools (confirmed working) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>protonfix added for Halo 3: ODST mod tools (confirmed working) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>Fall Guys protonfix updated to fix hang after EOS install on clean prefix setup.</li>
<li>Witcher 2 protonfix added to fix failure to launch on systems with large core counts</li>
<li>Farcry 3 protonfix added to fix failure to launch on systems with large core counts</li>
<li>Battlefield Bad Company 2 protonfix removed, no longer needed and was causing DXVK not to load for the game</li>
<li>Endless Space 2 protonfix removed, was causing game to crash. Game now works but videos are upside down (known proton issue)</li>
<li>Gwent: Rogue Mage protonfix added</li>
<li>SQUAD protonfix EAC blob updated to last-known working version</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One we apparently missed that arrived with Native Linux support back in May, Voodoo Detective is a Monkey Island inspired point-and-click adventure from Short Sleeve Studio. It has a Very Positive user rating on Steam, so seems like it's worth a highlight if you're after something new.</p>
<p>"New Ginen: a small island town steeped in rich Voodoo culture, overrun by chain stores, infested with privileged tourists.

Against this fascinating backdrop we meet a mysterious woman with no past standing at the center of a drama so profound the threads of reality are threatening to unravel!</p>
<p>Join Voodoo Detective on his latest case, where danger hides behind every dirty secret and each thrilling moment may be his last. It’s time to don your fedora and trench coat, detective, you’ve got a mystery to solve!"</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta gets Firefox as Flatpak, mentions &#34;future controller hardware revisions&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219978214106" target="_blank">SteamOS Beta update</a> for Steam Deck and it finally sorts out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/you-should-avoid-the-stock-firefox-install-on-steam-deck-as-its-badly-outdated/" target="_blank">Firefox situation</a>, along with hints of hardware changes, or a new controller coming?</p>
<p>With Firefox previously being installed with the OS, it would only update with the OS updates and Valve were lagging behind on it (a lot). Now it's a Flatpak from Flathub, so it will get installed and updated via the Discover app so you will be able to sort updates yourself in desktop mode.</p>
<p>They also added a "VGUI2 Classic" desktop theme, made it so network connections made and edited in desktop mode will now be system wide to work properly in Gaming Mode, initial IBus IME input support on desktop mode for Chinese / Japanese / Korean keyboards, and fixed up Xbox login window for Flight Simulator and Halo Infinite not rendering certain characters properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20555171591658960215gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20555171591658960215gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - VGUI2 Classic.</em></p>
<p>One that really catches the eye though is the note that there's been updates to "controller firmware utilities to support future controller hardware revisions". Before getting overly excited about a Steam Controller 2 though, it's most likely aimed towards adjustments to manufacturing of the Steam Deck as we already know it's had a few adjustments since the initial first batch. That said, I would love a Steam Controller 2, please Valve.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> — not too long after, Valve also released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219978165742" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added favorite and popular guides to the Steam Overlay for easy access</li>
<li>Added notification when Steam Deck temperature goes outside the safe operating range</li>
<li>Achievement progress notifications (ie. You've collected 5/100 berries) will no longer play sounds</li>
<li>Resized virtual keyboard in Desktop mode to the appropriate dimensions</li>
<li>Fixed some performance problems for users with many screenshots</li>
<li>Fixed some navigation issues on an app's Achievements page</li>
<li>Fixed some touch styling issues with the virtual keyboard</li>
<li>Fixed sound playing for achievement progress notifications</li>
<li>Fixed overlay menu issues with games that do not have achievements</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Excavation of Hob&#39;s Barrow has some real fancy pixel-art</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gimme! The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is an upcoming adventure from developer Cloak and Dagger Games with publishing from Wadjet Eye Games and it instantly grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>Originally called INCANTAMENTUM, the developer decided on the name change because it was a bit difficult to remember and pronounce. Can't really argue with that. Teaming up with Wadjet Eye also means they are getting help to expand and polish the game with voice acting, along with getting Linux and macOS ports too.</p>
<p>Check out the new teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zWRzaySj0MA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57aa0343d4b8e020b6787a78f2e4d3eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zWRzaySj0MA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind.<br/>
<br/>
Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The excavation of Hob’s Barrow is off to a rocky start. And then Thomasina starts having strange dreams…</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>dark</strong>, <strong>complex </strong>and <strong>evolving </strong>storyline featuring interwoven elements from real English folklore.</li>
<li>Traditional <strong>point and click</strong> adventure game <strong>puzzles </strong>and interactions, with an easy modern interface.</li>
<li>A cast of<strong> intriguing characters</strong>, from suspicious villagers to sickly vicars to lordly landowners, all with their own unique stories and motives.</li>
<li>A distinct<strong> folk horror</strong> tone and grounding.</li>
<li>Evocative<strong> pixel-art </strong>graphics, featuring cut-scenes and engaging animations.</li>
<li>A suitably <strong>atmospheric original soundtrack</strong> from the musician behind the award-winning "Football Game" soundtrack.</li>
<li><em><strong>Fiends in the furrows, the smell of damp soil, and a cat or two.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Wishlist and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182310/The_Excavation_of_Hobs_Barrow/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>. A release is due later this year.</p>

      <title>September will bring the melee focused Steam Bash Bash event</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3330988721845691320" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Steam Bash Bash event will be going live between September 19 and September 26. This particular event is more of a violent one with the focus on hack and slash, spectacle fighters and whatever games focus on some form of melee fighting hence the bash bash.</p>
<p>This isn't just another little genre-focused sale event though, it's going to be a little more like Next Fest it appears with sections for unreleased games and demos to get their own bit in the spotlight too.</p>
<p>Looks like this time it's invite-only by Valve too, as Valve will be reaching out to developers about it as long as they have the Steamworks permission "Receive Steamworks Communication" set.</p>
<p>Valve list various criteria for games and those that are primarily thought of as one of these types: Character Action Games, Spectacle Fighter, Hack-and-Slash and Musou. Games must have melee combat as the "primary game mechanic" too and Valve said they typically have some of these too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RPG elements</li>
<li>Third-person gameplay</li>
<li>Fast-paced combat</li>
<li>Swordplay, shooting, etc.</li>
<li>Tracked combat combos or a visual representation of damage being dealt</li>
<li>Character moveset/weapon customization</li>
<li>Score/ranking system </li>
</ul>

      <title>Hobo Cat Adventures features dark humour and souls-like combat - now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one missed from earlier in July, the colourful 3D platformer Hobo Cat Adventures gained Native Linux support. Looks pretty great too with some dark humour and apparently souls-like combat (in other words, difficult).</p>
<p>"In Hobo Cat Adventures you play as a homeless cat willing to do every job there is on offer. You travel to the Squirrel Kingdom – a place full of weird characters, dangerous enemies and lots of treasures to find. King Daniel, party animal and ruler of the Squirrel Kingdom, has got a special job for you! Ring the three bells of awakening!"</p>
<p>It's not a particularly well-known title and doesn't have a lot of reviews on it but for the small amount on Steam, so far all but 1 of the user reviews are giving it a thumbs up. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GiCFUdNnziM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08bffcd66b942d9f698b1fa5c8904019.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GiCFUdNnziM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Visit 7 areas</li>
<li>Collect 24 gold bags</li>
<li>Defeat 6 Bosses</li>
<li>Find 7 unique weapons</li>
<li>Ring 3 bells</li>
<li>Unlock 42 achievements</li>
<li>Two different endings</li>
<li>Souls inspired lock-on combat system</li>
<li>Cartoony blood and gore</li>
<li>Meet weird, unique characters</li>
<li>Contains a lot of (im)mature humour</li>
<li>Lovingly made by only one person</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cancelled space sim Limit Theory opens up the source code</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Limit Theory was a once very promising looking space sim that was funded on Kickstarter. Sadly the developer cancelled it but now as promised they've <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshparnell/limit-theory-an-infinite-procedural-space-game/posts/3564318" target="_blank">opened up</a> the source code. Most of the code is under the "The Unlicense", which is OSI approved so it is properly open source too.</p>
<p>Why did it all end though? Well after multiple years in development, back in 2018 the developer put a post on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshparnell/limit-theory-an-infinite-procedural-space-game/posts/2270873" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> mentioning how they were out of funding and out of energy for the project as a whole. They also underestimated the sheer amount of work that would go into making such a big space sim.</p>
<p>It's a shame it never got finished but open sourcing was the right thing to do, since other people helped to fund it.</p>
<p>As an example of what it could have been, the developer did plenty of videos on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LimitTheory/videos" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel showing off various stages of progress on it. The below video is the last one they put out on it:</p>

      <title>Terminal-based game inspired by Pokémon gets a big upgrade with audio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pokete is a game we introduced you too recently that's inspired by Pokémon but you play it in a terminal. A new release is out bringing some nice advancements.</p>
<p>A big one for version 0.8.0 is the addition of audio and it's suitably retro and fits right in with the theme too. Really helps bring the game to life just that little bit more. Easy to run too, with an AppImage included with the release that you can just drop into a terminal and get going.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15111054061658919676gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15111054061658919676gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4481361791658919675gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4481361791658919675gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the highlights from the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added audio</li>
<li>Removed pynput as a dependency on windows</li>
<li>A lot of spelling and grammar fixes</li>
<li>Fixed Poketes not beeing freeable</li>
<li>Added some game ballancing</li>
<li>Trainers can now obtain more than one Pokete</li>
<li>Made run away random</li>
<li>Added remappable controls</li>
<li>Save location is now based on XDG dirs, no intervention needed</li>
<li>Added quick attacks using <code class="inline-code">yzcv</code> so the attackamenu can be skipped</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can grab it free from <a href="https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>VRChat adds Easy Anti-Cheat, community not happy but Linux and Steam Deck work fine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite the name, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/" target="_blank">VRChat</a> is not a VR-only space and it's incredibly popular. Recently though, they added in Easy Anti-Cheat and the community is currently very unhappy with it.</p>
<p>Why does such a social space need anti-cheat though? As they said in their <a href="https://hello.vrchat.com/blog/vrchat-security-update" target="_blank">announcement</a> modified clients became a big problem. They allowed users to "attack and harass others" which caused endless moderation problems. Plus, they explained that every month "thousands" of people have their accounts stolen due to these modified clients. So it is a big issue.</p>
<p>The downside is that some big features that a lot of people enjoyed have been lost, since no modified clients can be run, and some people can't play at all due to it. The developer said addressing those concerns is their "highest priority" and they're moving around their roadmap for it.</p>
<p>Since Easy Anti-Cheat supports Linux, the developers ensured and tested it working for Proton and Steam Deck so there should be no issues continuing to run it. As they said in their blog post announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1658767962113_13675">
<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p><strong>Does this prevent people from playing VRChat on platforms like SteamOS on the Steam Deck? What about Linux via Proton?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No,</strong> we’ve tested this! EAC works fine on these platforms. Thanks to Valve and the Proton team for all their hard work.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly they've hit a nerve with the community though, as it's now getting review-bombed on Steam with the most recent user reviews hitting Overwhelmingly Negative.</p>

      <title>Total War: Warhammer III cautiously builds upon a tried and true formula</title>
      <author>BTRE</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest entry in the Total War franchise was ported by Feral Interactive over to Linux last month. After spending a good chunk of time commanding armies and bringing chaos to the land, I have a few thoughts to share.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GcG6dVTsv1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e18024e573ceb21d904fd7d83ceb0447.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GcG6dVTsv1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Key provided by Feral Interactive</p>
<p>For those of you who might be unaware, the mouthful-of-a-name Total War: Warhammer III is the third entry in the crossover over franchises of the strategic Total War games with the setting of Warhammer Fantasy. It sees players picking between various races and factions and fighting for supremacy, either trying to save or covet the power of an imprisoned and dying god. The game mixes a strategic turn-based layer where armies are recruited and directed, cities conquered or sacked, with real-time battles where hundreds of units might be pitted against one another.</p>
<p>I’ve played a great deal of the Total War series over the years and the core formula remains more or less unchanged. The developers have gotten good at polishing the heart of things and so, even at the game’s worst, it never fails to be at least somewhat entertaining. Effort has been made in this latest entry to add unique mechanics to every faction, mainly choices that can be made every couple of turns that allow for some sort of strategic advantage or boost to units or cities. The technology trees are unique and, often, there might even be different ways to approach city construction and income generation.</p>
<p>The bloodthirsty demons of Khorne may, for example, raze a settlement upon capture, spawning a smaller army from the chaos that can then go on to cause more mayhem before dissipating a couple of turns later. They then have a chance to expand into depopulated settlements automatically, so long as they own another settlement in the region. If not, they can use their unique secondary currency, skulls, to create a settlement. These same skulls are gained from battle or by razing cities and are spent on technologies or to perform special rites that gain the player the favor of Khorne.</p>
<p>Another faction, Grand Cathay, is a Warhammer Fantasy's answer to the Chinese Empire and incorporates a mechanic of harmony between yin and yang, providing bonuses if your empire keeps the elements balanced. Units, buildings and commanders all are either one or the other and some building chains are mutually exclusive. So keeping an eye on the overall situation of your empire is a must. Additionally, trade caravans may be sent to far-off cities, taking several turns to reach their destination and liable to events and possible battles by hostile factions that attack it. If the caravan reaches its destination, a large return on the invested gold is given to the player.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how these base factions are all different, given that previous titles only really reserved these more obvious differences for the DLC factions that were added in a steady trickle after launch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12957111751658715083gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12957111751658715083gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Most of these bells and whistles are found in the singleplayer campaign, the real heart of the game. Every faction essentially competes with one another to reach the dying bear-god Ursun before it dies. While there’s a simplified diplomacy and trade system, by and large interactions with factions will inevitably end with war. To break up the usual map-painting and territory-conquering, every couple of turns portals that lead to the realm of the Chaos Gods open on the map. Factions may then venture forth in order to claim a Daemon Prince’s soul from each god, navigating the hazards of each realm in the process.</p>
<p>I think that this is a particularly good innovation compared to the previous titles, as it’s easier for the AI to keep up with the player throughout the campaign. I had to keep an eye on AI opponents’ progress and be mindful of balancing my expansion; if my main army was too far away from a portal at the wrong time it could mean the difference between snatching a soul before the AI or not. In two of my campaigns, an AI faction got all four souls before of me. I was still able to eventually win, however, as armies can be intercepted before they reach the site of the final campaign battle. Defeating a faction leader makes them lose their collected souls, and so I was able to buy myself a little time and make it myself before Ursun finally succumbed.</p>
<p>The downside to this more focused advancement is, however, that every faction’s win condition is more or less the same. The pre-scripted battles in the Chaos Realms as well as the final battle are a little underwhelming if you do them more than once. There are some faction-specific quests and expansion targets, along with some unique buildings that can be built in specific towns—if conquered—but that does little to offset the general focus. Overall, I’d take this more precise approach over the slogs that characterized the first two titles.</p>
<p>Unit rosters are fairly varied between factions, with some favoring ranged units, cavalry, special abilities, hit and run tactics and all the other things that are, by now, standard to Total War games. There ‘s still some room for experimentation within your faction’s roster, with a few alternative units and heroes potentially emphasizing certain thematic aspects of the faction more than others. For example, Kislev’s infantry tend to also have some ranged capabilities that can either be a basis for a flexible core of all-rounders or be used as distractions for powerful cavalry and ice witches to really do a lot of damage. As units unlock towards the end game, there’s still often good reason to use more basic units in your army as well, thanks to unlocked technologies and bonuses given by commanders.</p>
<p>That said, not every faction is equal. While it’s less obvious in the singleplayer campaign, during single battles with the AI or in multiplayer, these disparities become more obvious. Despite a few patches addressing balance issues, things aren’t quite all there yet. The fact remains that some factions are less competitive than others. Especially when it comes to auto-resolving combat which, again, has been addressed with patches, but still can be needlessly harsh. In a long campaign this can mean a few more hours spent winning relatively-unimportant battles manually in order to preserve the strength of your carefully-recruited armies.</p>
<p>The battle AI itself remains on par with other Total War titles. In other words, it can win against a weaker player but it is usually tactically incompetent. It is easy to flank units, bait it and otherwise apply basic counters to (usual) numerical superiority. The most interesting types of battles came about when trying to hold off a far-flung outpost against a surprise attack using only garrison troops. Part of this is due to the asymmetry but also due to the new siege battle system which allows defenders to place their own obstacles and structures according to available resources. The longer the siege (or with certain technologies unlocked), the more toys defenders will potentially be able to set. It’s a nice novelty but one that ultimately becomes less and less thrilling over the course of a campaign, let alone multiple ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10544899001658715085gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10544899001658715085gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Visually, I think that Total War: Warhammer III is generally nice to look at. The Chaos Realms are very unique and have lots of little details and animations that are worth appreciating. Other areas of the map are likewise vibrant, with their own landmarks and special features. But, sadly, all of that gets relatively little opportunity to shine. Because the main conflict will be between the various Chaos factions in the northern, icy wasteland and others, the battlefields tend to repeat themselves a lot. I couldn’t begin to tell you just how many times I fought on similar-looking snow-capped hills or in dead borderlands.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is true to the lore of Warhammer Fantasy. Still, given the ostentatiously colorful lizardmen of the previous entry with their jungle environs, the green and messy orks in the badlands or the cool dead civilization of the desert tomb lords, I can’t help but feel that fighting in predominantly icy areas for most of the game is comparatively bland. It is only in far-flung areas on the periphery of the map—where there is little reason to expand and fight—that jungle, forest, badlands and other areas can be found. An average playthrough will see little-to-no player involvement in those places as you'll be too busy dealing with the AI and the Chaos Realms to send expeditions there.</p>
<p>This particular complaint is already set to be addressed soon. The upcoming Immortal Empires update is expected the be released into beta next month and will combine the map and factions of previous games into a sort of mega campaign. Owners of previous titles will get access to this new campaign along with other free content. It’s something to be excited about and I look forward to seeing how all the disparate factions will alter the feel of the game.</p>
<p>On the technical front, Feral’s Linux port is a solid affair. It easily outperforms the Proton version of the game across the board. The difference is smallest at higher graphical settings (likely due to bottlenecking from my own hardware) but I noticed higher minimums and more higher, and more consistent, frame rates with the port. My aging RX 480 was able to hit a 60 FPS target on both the campaign map and in battles using a mix of settings, mostly in the mid range. Cranking up certain details or options short of ‘ultra’ still provided a very playable experience that staying above 30 FPS. I should also note that the Linux port also has an FSR option that’s not found in the Windows version, allowing players on older hardware to sacrifice a little visual fidelity for higher performance.</p>
<p>There are a pair of very notable drawbacks to the Linux port, however. First and most noticeable is the lack of cross-platform multiplayer. Those playing the port will be unable to play with Windows users. So if you’re into the more competitive multiplayer side of the Total War fandom, it might be best to stick with playing the game via Proton.</p>
<p>Secondly, patches are likely to be delayed for the port. Shortly after the port’s release, the game got its 1.3 update which had a few important balance and quality-of-life changes. It took several weeks for that patch, and a few hotfixes, to make it to the Linux side of things. Given that it was much the same for older releases done by Feral, I would expect that it might be a long while before Linux gamers get their hands on the hotly-anticipated Immortal Empires patch with its expanded campaign and map.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I think that Total War: Warhammer III is a fine game that is likely to get even better with time. It might stay a little close to the tried and true formula for my tastes but the things that are new, such as the Chaos Realms, are welcome attempts to shake things up a little. Elsewhere, it's pretty much just the usual Total War fare. I’m willing to overlook the weak battle AI because the general experience of trying to survive and thrive amidst the challenges from all directions is compelling enough to provide satisfaction upon the completion of a hard-fought campaign. But others might not be so generous and more hardcore players might be put off by the lack of progress on that front. Still, if it's any consolation, there is already a vibrant mod scene. The usual difficulty and balance mods, quality-of-life improvements, and ambitious overhauls and player expansions can be found in the workshop.</p>
<p>With big changes only a month away, it might be prudent to wait until then before hopping into the game for the first time. No doubt large balance changes will follow, as well the usual additional free content that Creative Assembly is known to include with big updates.</p>

      <title>DIMENSIONAL SLAUGHTER is an absolutely wild sounding fast-paced retro shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have the need for speed and love a good retro first-person shooter? DIMENSIONAL SLAUGHTER is what you should take a look at.</p>
<p>The developer calls it a "movement shooter" that has taken " the best parts of what makes both modern and retro shooters such as DOOM ETERNAL and QUAKE fun, then sticks them in a blender with fast paced Rogue-Like progression and Perma-Death, leaving for an even more intense experience with absolutely NO space for filler". I know that description will certainly pull in a few eyes. There's also "no intrusive story", it's all about the gibs.</p>
<p>It seems to do a few curious things like sending you through different dimensions with different enemies, and a unique weapon for each area. In a way, the way you progress sounds perhaps a bit like Risk of Rain 2 but the order of the areas you go is randomized. Why is it a movement shooter then? Well, everything is fast as hell and ammunition is a reward for moving around so you have to stay on your toes.</p>

<p>It's definitely not the prettiest around but I'm sure the action will make plenty of FPS fans happy.</p>
<p>The system requirements are mildly amusing too noting it needs "Sound Card: LOUDEST POSSIBLE DAMMIT", and on the macOS side "Additional Notes: shouldn't have bought a mac" — ouch.</p>

      <title>hexceed is a free hexagonal Minesweeper out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new relaxing puzzle game that doesn't require guesswork? Recently hexceed gained a Native Linux port. While the main game is completely free, it does have paid DLC which includes a ton of extra content. The main game has a Very Positive review score on Steam so looks like another quality game to add to your collection.</p>
<p>The Linux port was noted in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1463920/view/3399672421079102870" target="_blank">news post</a>, which also went over another DLC pack that went up adding over 100 new levels to play through. I don't think the gameplay needs much explaining really, it's just an interesting small twist on the well-known mechanics of Minesweeper but looks worth a go.</p>

      <title>Free and open source multiplayer voxel RPG &#39;Veloren&#39; version 0.13 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking more promising than ever, the in-development free and open source RPG <a href="https://veloren.net/" target="_blank">Veloren</a> has a big new release out. A fully original open source game although it does take inspiration from Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20014498271658760226gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of what's new in this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular weapons</li>
<li>Real-time weather: rain, wind, thunder, lightning</li>
<li>Cliff towns</li>
<li>Interconnected cave networks with cave biomes</li>
<li>LoD trees (looks more visually interesting far-off)</li>
<li>More character customisation options</li>
<li>NPC personalities</li>
<li>Loot ownership for drops from mining</li>
<li>New ambience sounds</li>
<li>Slider for ambience volume</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
<p>Good to see it continue to advance. It's properly playable, although a lot of the work currently is still going into the technical implementations of all the features so it's not quite a proper game yet, still somewhat fun to go exploring in though.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess is an upcoming choice-driven psychological horror visual novel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Tabby Games have just announced Slay the Princess. It's a choice-driven psychological horror visual novel / dating sim with dramatic branching, light RPG elements and hand-penciled art. This is the same developer who created Scarlet Hollow, a popular episodic visual novel.</p>
<p>I found Scarlet Hollow to be pretty great so it's nice to see the developer do more, and with Native Linux support again. See the new reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RByDoYQpFa8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6705218599bf8407c1d6cad9042962b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RByDoYQpFa8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A princess.</strong> She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li><strong>No, the Princess isn't a cosmic horror.</strong> She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li><strong>Don't even think about trying to romance her.</strong> It won't end well for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hopefully you won't die.</strong> But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>Time loops <strong>No time loops.</strong> Don't be ridiculous. Time is a strictly linear concept and it certainly doesn't "loop," whatever that's supposed to mean.</li>
<li><strong>A branching narrative</strong> where what you say and what you believe determines both your build and how the story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fully voice-acted</strong> by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Looks like upcoming brawler MultiVersus works great on Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/" target="_blank">MultiVersus</a> is a very exciting one that has a lot of people talking right now. It's a brawler much like Smash Bros made by Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games and it's already looking pretty great.</p>
<p>You can currently get a key by watching one hour of it on Twitch, if the streamer has drops enabled or buy buying a Founder pack. Or, just wait until July 26th when it goes into Open Beta. I managed to get a key to take a look, and it seems out of the box it just works with Proton.</p>
<p>Why are people so excited about it? Well, Smash Bros has a huge fanbase and people have been wanting something properly <em>popular</em> like this on PC for a while, plus you have a roster of rather fun characters included in this like Shaggy that appears to power up like he's in Dragon Ball — what's not to love? Since it will be free to play, there's no barrier to entry either.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WSmayHK7Nl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13be42bdd800d8fab9b471efb1dd1b70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WSmayHK7Nl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One thing I did notice when testing it on my Fedora Linux desktop with an Xbox controller, was to turn off Steam Configuration support in the Big Picture settings for Xbox controllers, otherwise the game wouldn't detect it. Apart from that, on desktop Linux it works great too.</p>

      <title>GameMode performance tool from Feral Interactive version 1.7 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" target="_blank">GameMode</a>, the system optimization tool from Feral Interactive recently had a new small release put up.</p>
<p>What does it do? When you run games with it the tool can do things like tweak the CPU governor for performance, change the I/O priority, process niceness, kernel scheduler, inhibit the screensaver, set your GPU into performance mode, allows custom scripts and so on. The point is that it can in a lot of cases ensure you're giving a game as much power as possible but it doesn't always work so well.</p>
<p>Version 1.7 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new utility: <code class="inline-code">gamemodelist</code> to show running processes using it</li>
<li>Run executables from <code class="inline-code">PATH</code> instead of <code class="inline-code">/usr/bin</code> to work across more distributions</li>
<li>Add a trivial <code class="inline-code">gamemode.conf</code> file, which creates the gamemode group to help control permissions</li>
<li>Various minor bugfixes and updates to documentation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once installed to run it on specific games with Steam, all you would need to do is add this as a launch option for example:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gamemoderun %command%</code></p>
<p>Or for standalone games:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gamemoderun ./game</code></p>

      <title>You can now get Halo Infinite online to work on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's taken quite a while but you can at least now play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> multiplayer on Steam Deck (single-player not tested). This is all unofficial right now, so try it at your own risk.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest updates to <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> and the latest Steam Deck Beta (the <u>Preview</u> branch), you can get it to work. If you need to know how to install GE-Proton on Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">follow this guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the main steps to get it working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt into the Steam Deck Preview</li>
<li>In desktop mode: download GE-Proton 7-26 using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">linked guide</a></li>
<li>Open Halo Infinite local files and delete or rename the "videos" folder</li>
<li>Set Halo Infinite to use GE-Proton7-26. Open Halo Infinite in your Steam Library and click the little Cog Icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that's all done, online play with Halo Infinite on Steam Deck should just work. There's still a few lingering issues though like some audio stutter plus some textures can flash a bit but it's quite playable overall. Here's a video of the steps needed plus the settings used and some rough footage:</p>

      <title>Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced 3D rail shooter inspired by the likes of Star Fox out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic 90s rail shooters like Star Fox? You should take a look at Ex-Zodiac, which just hit Early Access. Built in Godot Engine it comes with Native Linux support right away and it's looking good, it also works great on the Steam Deck too and feels like a really good fit there.</p>
<p>"Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced rail shooter with a stylized look reminiscent of early 90's 3D games. Join protagonist Kyuu as she fights to free the worlds of the Sanzaru Star System, overrun by the intergalactic terrorist organization known as Zodiac."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I5wDKWydhjs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fbb82c0676fd1803d614100d31b5265.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I5wDKWydhjs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>6 main levels and 6 bonus levels currently (more than 12 will be available after full release)</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis</li>
<li>Barrel rolls</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, I've been having a lot of fun with it. Firmly bringing back memories of playing classics like it on Sega Mega Drive, Nintendo 64 and others around that sort of time. Some of the boss battles can be quite a challenge, as is getting used to the way the ship moves all around the screen with the camera focus continue forwards. The presentation is simply wonderful too!</p>
<p>Some footage recorded on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lMWQc1aDq94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e849f92459718db6b05702dd6bef21d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lMWQc1aDq94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer thinks it will remain in Early Access for 1 year with plenty more content to come yet.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249480/ExZodiac/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition gets certified for Ubuntu 22.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out for a new laptop and perhaps the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/initial-thoughts-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> didn't take your fancy? Well now the <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-plus-laptop/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/ctox13w11p1c4001u" target="_blank">Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition</a> has been properly certified for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>Canonical announced the update today on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/dell-xps-13-plus-developer-edition-now-certified-with-ubuntu-22-04-lts" target="_blank">their blog</a>, noting that the roll-out will begin in August for those who want the up to date experience on solid hardware. As Canonical also <a href="https://ubuntu.com/certified/laptops?q=&amp;limit=20&amp;release=22.04+LTS" target="_blank">showed</a>, this is the first mainstream hardware to be certified for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>While anyone can download Ubuntu (and other distributions) and attempt to run them on various devices, the point of the official certification is so that Canonical can ensure "that all of the components in a certified computer work as expected, so the user can be sure of the best experience out of the box". Of course, buying one with Linux pre-loaded like this also shows there's a market for more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/871496121658409326gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/871496121658409326gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the XPS Plus include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>12th Gen Intel® Core™ 28W processors</li>
<li>A seamless glass touch pad</li>
<li>Improved quad speaker design resulting in incredible sound for music, movies and conferencing.</li>
<li>Up to 4K+ resolution or vivid true-to-life colour on an OLED display with Eyesafe® that reduces harmful blue light</li>
<li>M.2 PCIe Gen 4 NVMe Solid State Drive</li>
<li>Up to 32 GB, LPDDR5, 5200 MHz, integrated, dual-channel</li>
<li>Larger fans that provide 55% better airflow</li>
<li>All-new packaging is made from 100% sustainably sourced or renewable materials with paper documentation that increases its recyclability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“XPS is an innovation portal for Dell – from its application of cutting-edge technology to experimentation of new user interfaces and experiential design,” said Jaewook Woo, Product Manager, Linux Operating System, Dell Technologies. “By bringing the enhanced performance and power management features of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to our most advanced premium laptop, Dell and Canonical reinforce our joint commitment to continue delivering the best computing experience for developers using Ubuntu.”</p>
<p>“The XPS 13 is a long-standing flagship range for Ubuntu on laptops”, said Oliver Smith, Product Manager for Ubuntu Desktop, Canonical. “It’s fantastic to see the XPS 13 Plus and Ubuntu 22.04 deliver a first-class hardware and software experience for developers, 10 years on from the start of Project Sputnik”.</p>
