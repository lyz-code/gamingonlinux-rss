      <title>Vampire Survivors latest Beta adds online play and more new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is finally getting the promised online mode, with a Beta now available to try that also includes some new content.</p>
<p>There's quite a few differences to playing it online instead of in local co-op including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch level up</strong> - Depending on the player count you will only see level up after all players have leveled up. So on 4 players the level up screen will only show every 4 levels.</li>
<li><strong>DLC </strong>- You will only be able to use DLC online if every player owns that DLC. We're retro-fitting Online into an originally single player game written in JS by a solo dev, so there are a lot of technical issues we have to move around or worry about later, one of which is the way that DLC expansions are handled.</li>
<li><strong>Free Roam</strong> - In online you are not restricted to the same screen, you can all freely move around the stage independently. (Note: You will be pulled into a boss room if any player walks into it)</li>
<li><strong>Spectator mode</strong> - When you die in multiplayer you can use the mouse to jump to players who are still alive. You also respawn where they are if you are spectating them.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements </strong>- You will have the choice at the end of the run to carry over any achievements earned in that run back into your own save file.</li>
<li><strong>Speed up</strong> - Disabled in online.</li>
<li><strong>Pause menu</strong> - To help flow, when you pause, you do not pause for everyone else, you just get a small window of invincibility</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the PC release, it will be a free update but they're not giving an exact date on when it will leave Beta, other than sometime this "Autumn". Save data will carry over as well, so you should hopefully not have any problems when it does leave Beta. There's no matchmaking for online mode, it's purely based on room codes or invites. Currently no cross-play either.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7689504721756486511gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7689504721756486511gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus some new content was also added as a Preview of the new update in the same opt-in Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>15 new achievements to unlock:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 new stages</li>
<li>2 new characters</li>
<li>2 new weapons and their evolutions</li>
<li>1 old passive weapon</li>
<li>3 new darkanas</li>
<li>3 new relics to get:
	<ul>
<li>1 new power-up</li>
<li>1 new character transformation</li>
<li>1 new game mode: PARTY MODE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's only a small slice of what's to come, as the new content will be added to the Beta in batches. Two more parts are due to be added but they aren't saying what just yet.</p>

      <title>Steam UK users will now need a credit card to access mature content due to the Online Safety Act</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/08/25 - 16:59 UTC</strong>: since there's reports of it still working even with a Debit Card and not just a Credit Card (they're different in the UK), I've asked Valve if they have any comments on this. Since in the UK, even a preteen can get a Debit Card.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 - 19:33 UTC</strong> - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux to confirm allowing Debit Cards for verification was a bug, which has now been solved.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valve recently put up a new support page, detailing the steps they've taken to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>The UK Online Safety Act has a rather broad scope, and has been the cause of many changes not just for UK citizens but people worldwide as more and more websites realise they're in scope of the act and have to make changes. It covers all sorts of thing from porn to community forums and more. And yes, that even includes video games too (which many developers likely aren't even aware of). If a video game has user to user communication (voice / text chat) and it's available in the UK, the developer will need to comply with it.</p>
<p>The likes of Reddit, Bluesky, Discord, Xbox and more have already rolled out verification systems.</p>
<p>To comply with it, Valve will now be requiring users from the UK to have a valid credit card stored on their account. Valve will do a direct check (that costs Â£0 to users) using their own internal payment processing system "which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard".</p>
<p>If you don't do this you won't be able to access "Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs".</p>
<p>In the UK, you have to be at least 18 to have a credit card, so this way does make a lot of sense - as you'll already be age verified if you have a credit card in your name. Valve additionally say that "Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons".</p>
<p>Valve feel this way "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" as the data they will process during this is no different to simply making a purchase on Steam. It's also only required if you've specifically opted into seeing mature content on Steam.</p>

      <title>Roguelike third-person mech-action shooter RIG Riot to be Steam Deck optimised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a ridiculous sucker for mech-action games and RIG Riot just landed on my radar. A roguelike third-person mech-action shooter with some fun looking combat.</p>
<p>The developer has posted an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3180340/announcements/detail/499456994710651236" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam to note how they plan to ensure it works well on Steam Deck, with current testing showing it will run at 60FPS after only a few tweaks of the settings and they plan to continue optimising it.</p>
<p>More about it: "RIG Riot is a roguelike third-person mech-action shooter. Travel through increasingly difficult stages and collect weapons and mods with powerful effects. Discover unique synergies that suit your playstyle, and travel the megastructure in search of rare permanent parts to perfect your RIG."</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer which shows off some action along with mech customization:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FUIGASjxiYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a26f841a289971abe4d2e98c4c55d5aa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FUIGASjxiYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exciting Combat</strong></p>
<p>Combat can feel quite different depending on the style of RIG you build. Do you prefer a light and mobile mech that bombards their foes from range with a trusty sniper? How about a well-rounded powerhouse who focuses on bringing the pain with missile bombardments and automatic rifles? Or maybe you prefer a tanky build that barrels through all opposition with laser blades and shotguns? Put together your build and then prepare for fast-paced combat against a wide array of enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Customization</strong></p>
<p>In RIG Riot, every loss is an opportunity. Dive into the garage and check out the exciting new parts you've earned. Every part in RIG Riot is made out of a combination of components from the various full sets available in the game. On top of that, rare parts can be found with their own powerful effects. There are an incredible amount of parts to find- which will you use?</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Synergies</strong></p>
<p>Finds the best ways to make your unique RIG shine as you travel through increasingly difficult stages. Search for rare weapons and mods with effects that compliment your build to see just how far you can go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right to the top of my wishlist this one goes.</p>

      <title>Monster-catching, dungeon-crawling RPG Siralim Ultimate gets a big 2.0 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite the developer being done with it, they've expanded it again. Siralim Ultimate 2.0 is out now as the "biggest update ever". Even before this update the game was massive, and easily one of the biggest monster-catching games ever made. Now it's truly huge.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Tough to pin down properly to a genre, because it blends quite a lot. There's monster catching, dungeon crawling and more with over 1,200 different creatures. The developer says to think of it like "Pokemon meets Diablo, or more accurately, Dragon Warrior Monsters meets Path of Exile". If you can appreciate the very retro style, there's a huge amount of depth to it.</p>
<p>In the new update they've translated it into 14 languages, there's various new game modes to play through from an Ironman Mode to a Calm Mode and more. You'll also find hundreds of new creatures, traits, spell gems, cards, and achievements.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-z_JTU3t0Ws"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5de6948edfe6e379f616d2c56fc8938e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-z_JTU3t0Ws" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Popular sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder Cobalt Core added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rated Overwhelmingly Positive from users on Steam, the sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder Cobalt Core just added official Linux support. It is already rated Steam Deck Verified using Proton but now it has a Linux version.</p>
<p>Not just popular with users on Steam, multiple critic reviews really enjoyed it back when it originally released with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/deckbuilder-fans-owe-themselves-some-time-with-the-brilliant-cobalt-core/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> noting it "might be the year's best deckbuilding game". It plays quite differently to the vast number of other deckbuilders, with its inventive single-axis spin on tactics games. You control a ship, where you need to position yourself along a horizontal axis to manually dodge missiles, line up your cannons and fire.</p>
<p>Check out the original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OE8_dfMhlfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c4d5dbed87c6791dfa5531f1e2e583.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OE8_dfMhlfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give orders to your crew by playing cards: Will you <strong>raise shields</strong> to protect your ship, <strong>dodge</strong> incoming missiles and cannon fire to avoid damage outright, or <strong>strike</strong> preemptively to disable your enemyâs weapons? Outmaneuver your foes to stay just ahead of impending calamity, and reach the Cobalt Core!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh new spin on tactics â</strong> dodge attacks and target weak points in this unique single-axis take on tactics combat. Outwit the enemy in a high stakes game of cat and mouse!</li>
<li><strong>Customize your deck â</strong> hundreds of cards and split upgrade paths means no two runs will be the same. Find that perfect combo that brings your deck from powerful to overpowered.</li>
<li><strong>Get to know your crew â</strong> each character comes with a completely unique playstyle and their own personal story. Bring 3 along, mix and match their decks, and see how these little goobers get along with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Tons of replayability â</strong> hundreds of different character+ship combinations before you even hit âstart runâ. Crank up the difficulty and really test your skills!</li>
<li><strong>Daily Challenges â</strong> Keep runs fresh with all sorts of modifiers. Can you win with just 1 character, or with your ship scrambling itself every fight? Play at your own pace, or get competitive on the leaderboards!</li>
<li><strong>Get in the groove â</strong> featuring 90+ minutes of catchy and electrifying original music by <em>Minecraft</em> composer Aaron Cherof!</li>
<li><strong>Forward momentum â</strong> untangle a narrative and unlock more playstyles as you go. Is there any escape from this time loop?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Linux version was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2179850/view/526478592467534257" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on August 27th, and it's live on Steam. They haven't yet ticked all the boxes to actually show it on the Steam page but it's there.</p>

      <title>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out now and Steam Deck Unsupported but SteamOS Compatible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater from KONAMI is a remake of the 2004 game METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER. It's out now but it's Steam Deck Unsupported.</p>
<p>Valve checked it out and put up a notice that it just can't perform well enough on Steam Deck, not even by their sometimes strange standards. Not exactly surprising though, this is a full next-gen remake with a big visual bump and a lot of newer AAA games have really struggled on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is at least noted to be SteamOS Compatible though, and so it will run with Proton on Linux systems that are a bit more powerful from other handhelds to Desktop Linux. And, early reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2417610?device=pc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> paint a reasonably positive picture for Desktop Linux.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SRQM7bf6DOg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06997e7267aad344434240d118fae845.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SRQM7bf6DOg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm not really up to date enough on Metal Gear Solid to go jumping into this one, so I won't be looking at it directly. </p>
<p>Are you playing it? What do you think so far?</p>

      <title>Gears of War: Reloaded is out now and works well on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been officially released so now we can experience the beginning on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, it does work rather nicely out of the box on the Steam Deck and seems like it does actually deserve the Steam Deck Verified rating. Naturally, on a more powerful Linux desktop, it's even better. It also uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is thankfully enabled for Linux platforms as noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>With this new edition powered by Unreal Engine you get all post-launch content for the original including a bonus campaign act, multiplayer maps, characters and cosmetics. The controls have also been updated to be a bit more modern feeling. It adds in 4K assets, remastered textures, lighting, shadows and reflections. Along with ultrawide support, HDR, a benchmark mod, VRR, mouse and keyboard support, AMD FSR 3.1 and DLSS3.5 Super Resolution.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VzJDY6V6C4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b8bd562bb1c443f766ac30de600c2c67.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VzJDY6V6C4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some nice accessibility settings included in this release too including multiple screen narration options, flash reduction, changing between tapping and holding for button tap challenges and more.</p>
<p>An issue I did encounter on Steam Deck is trying to link my Microsoft account, which is required for cross-platform online play. It just repeatedly failed to contact the servers when entering the code on my PC or phone. You can still play online with other PC players without it though. However, doing a full proper restart of the Steam Deck did <em>eventually</em> allow the linking connection to succeed.</p>
<p>The same issue with account linking I saw on my Linux Desktop too, it just always gave an error about the connection. I tried many times, through many reloads and it just refused. However, adding this Steam launch option for it did enable it to actually work eventually on Desktop Linux:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Here's the results when running the built-in benchmark mode on a Steam Deck LCD (SteamOS Beta - Proton 9.0-4), with the default graphics settings where it does actually look pretty good:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17668094701756389804gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17668094701756389804gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18683846781756389805gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18683846781756389805gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>

<p>And for my Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04 - Proton 9.0-4) running Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 here's what performance you might expect:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9757177021756390704gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9757177021756390704gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13710145201756390706gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13710145201756390706gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377975691756390706gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377975691756390706gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One important thing I will touch on here though are the reports about split-screen co-op from negative reviews and forum posts. It was actually originally advertised as having it on PC, but it does <em>not</em>. 15 days ago they removed the tags from Steam (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2523720/history/?changeid=30573436" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) without a word, and a previous trailer on Steam noted it that has since been edited to remove it. Not a good look overall and not surprising players aren't happy about that.</p>
<p>Now we just need the sequels to get remasters so we can play through them all properly on PC. For now, we'll have to settle for the prequel in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gears-of-war-e-day-announced-and-its-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gears of War: E-Day</a> that will arrive eventually (no date yet).</p>
<p>Overall, if you're after an action-packed experience this is a great game to pick up. I hadn't played it since the original edition of the game on Xbox 360 so this was a nice upgrade!</p>

      <title>Quartet is a fresh retro-styled RPG out now with Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Four years after their successful crowdfunding, Quartet from developer Something Classic Games is out now with Linux support and now Steam Deck Verified. Valve checked it over on the Native Linux version to give it the Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible rating.</p>
<p>A game for those of you who love the JRPG styled classics from the team that gave us Shadows of Adam back in 2017. Here's some more about it: "A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The worldâs unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x1dtKybfyaE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11eab8d9a90be8c736e1ab75e5a3c790.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x1dtKybfyaE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combat is fast-paced, turn-based, and full to the brim with TONS of special abilities to use. Each character and enemy turn are shown in the turn queue on the right, allowing the player to plan devastating and timely tactical strikes.</li>
<li>Players can unleash multiple elemental and physical abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</li>
<li>AP automatically regenerates after a hero's turn. So don't be stingyâspam those spells!</li>
<li>In Quartet, you control 4 characters on the front line, with the other 4 ready to jump into the action at any time. Ready to bring out your heavy-hitter or an emergency healer? Swap in seamlessly from the reserve party! Swapped-in characters take their turn immediately, with no penalty.</li>
<li>While characters are in the reserves, they also regenerate their ability points (AP) more rapidly, making swapping a crucial element of combat.</li>
<li>From the steampunk-inspired streets of Leornin to the forests on the barbarian frontier; from the cursed marshes of Tyche to the underworld warehouses of Seren, Quartet offers lots to explore.</li>
<li>Exploration is absolutely worth your while. With eight party members to equip, you need lots of gear, and a lot of it comes out of a treasure chest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: currently at time of writing the GOG store only has the Windows version.</p>

      <title>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is Steam Deck Verified but requires internet even for single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now rated Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds as Steam Deck Verified ahead of release, but we also now know you need to always be online to play it.</p>
<p>Yep, even for single-player racing you'll need an internet connection which is not just for Steam Deck - all platforms and it's also shipping with Denuvo Anti-tamper. The Steam Deck rating came in early this morning, with Valve testing it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>. Since it's Verified for Steam Deck it's also SteamOS Compatible, and will work on other Linux systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21247495941756385576gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Forcing internet connections doesn't exactly make it very portable. A shame to see more games doing this.</p>
<p>Check out the original trailer below:</p>

      <title>eXtremeRate reveal new Steam Deck back shells with interchangeable back buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>eXtremeRate emailed out an exciting new Steam Deck accessory. It's a new back shell design, with back buttons you can easily swap.</p>
<p>They're up for pre-order priced at either $29.99 or $31.99 depending on the colour you go for. The idea of buttons you can easily swap sounds good, as you might want different sizes on each of them depending on how you're going to use them, and how long your fingers are. And, the colours just look really cool too.</p>
<p>Colours include black, frosted white, clear, clear slate and clear atomic purple.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7156138951756381732gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Must admit, even though nowadays I don't really do any mods on either of my Steam Decks, this actually has me tempted. The colours look awesome, and I do love the button customization to make them just a little bit more comfortable for my tiny hands.</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="70DAwLiFkQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/024be1cf1ae4d0482428bfb45c9b07d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/70DAwLiFkQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only thing they haven't made clear is the release date. They say it's up for pre-order in the email to GamingOnLinux, their website says pre-order but they also say ready to ship with no dates listed. So â sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Blending classic Disney style animation with horror, Bye Sweet Carole releases in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh yes, gimme! Bye Sweet Carole looks absolutely incredible with the way it uses a very classic Disney-style animation with horror game vibes. They've just announced that it's going to launch on October 9th!</p>
<p>From developer Little Sewing Machine, it was founded by acclaimed artist and director Chris Darril, creator of the Remothered series. What actually is it? Set in the early 1900s it's a chilling narrative-horror game inspired by classic animation movies. You follow the last known whereabouts of Carole Simmons to uncover the dark truth behind the Bunny Hall orphanage.</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xakn5BBK77U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/69e4f87da45423d09959f0067720a3fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xakn5BBK77U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on a horrific journey through a dark tale set in the austere Bunny Hall and the mesmerizing world of Corolla.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a hand-drawn universe brought to life using cinematographic techniques inspired by the greatest animated movies.</li>
<li>Shape-shift into a rabbit and harness your various forms to conquer the deadly challenges that await you.</li>
<li>Encounter a vibrant cast of characters, from your loyal friend Mr. Baesie to the malevolent owl Velenia and the terrifying Mr. Kyn.</li>
<li>A unique journey born from the union of 2 diametrically opposed genres: a traditional animated fairy tale, in the most typical tradition of the princesses from the world of cinematic animation, and a survival horror with old school platform elements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hope this one is as good to play as it looks. Anyone else seriously excited by this one?</p>

      <title>Demonschool has been delayed until November due to Hollow Knight: Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Hollow Knight: Silksong released date has pushed the developers and publisher of Demonschool to adjust their plans, with a big delay until November. Demonschool was originally due to launch September 3rd, but they've sent word that it's now going to be November 19th.</p>
<p>What is it? Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14920454391756380278gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's the full statement from Brian Kwek of the publisher Ysbryd Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demonschool was set to launch on Sept. 3, but after much anguished consideration on our part, weâve made the decision to move the gameâs release to Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.</p>
<p>With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool.</p>
<p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p>
<p>We donât take this decision lightly. Demonschoolâs release has been delayed before, and we want to be clear: there are no more delays after this point. Weâve already distributed Steam keys to press as part of a healthy review program, and had every intention to proudly release on Sept 3. We hope fans who anticipated the game will forgive us for one final delay. </p>
<p>Between now and November, Necrosoft Games and ourselves will continue to pour our time into enhancing and polishing up the game experience. For example, there will be more endings and minigames that the developers originally planned to patch in post-release, rather than leave them on the cutting floor; now itâll all be part of the gameâs release in November.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm for Demonschool. We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Gamesâ labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19th!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't argue with any developer choosing to delay due to Silksong, it's going to be a huge release that sucks away time from a lot of gamers. </p>

      <title>The impressive app store Bazaar has arrived on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's many ways to install apps on Linux and Bazaar might be one of the slickest, with a focus on Flatpak and Flathub. First highlighted here on GamingOnLinux back in July <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/bazzite-gets-a-new-app-store-newly-supported-devices-improved-wifi-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when it was added to Bazzite</a>. Since then, the developers have continued expanding it and now it's looking really good.</p>
<p>Even easier to install now too, as it's directly available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16859298371756379450gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16859298371756379450gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While it's primarily designed for GNOME desktops, I've been running it on KDE Plasma and it all looks rather good. Fits in quite nicely still. Especially if your main source of apps is Flatpak, this is a really sleek alternative to the bigger few like GNOME Software and KDE Discover.</p>
<p>The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The popular Linux distro CachyOS has a big upgrade and some fun stuff for gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CachyOS is a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular choice for Linux gamers</a> based on Arch Linux (like SteamOS is too), and the <a href="https://cachyos.org/blog/2508-august-release/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">August update</a> brings some big new features.</p>
<p>One interesting thing for gamers is their Proton-CachyOS, their own version of Valve's Proton to run Windows games on Linux that has various extras applied to it. With the latest CachyOS update they expanded the options available for it. Taken from the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proton-CachyOS</strong> received several new features: a <strong>DLSS version upgrader</strong> and an option to <strong>force the latest preset</strong>. <strong>XeSS</strong> now has a similar version-upgrade feature. Weâve also made improvements for <strong>PhysX</strong>, and the required <strong>NVIDIA libraries</strong> are now bundled. On <strong>RDNA3</strong> GPUs, you can easily enable <strong>FSR 4</strong> with <code class="inline-code">PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE</code>; this downloads the FSR4 library and sets the necessary variables automatically. <strong>NTSync</strong> can now be used with Proton-CachyOS by setting <code class="inline-code">PROTON_USE_NTSYNC</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also introduced a new packages website, so you can check out what packages they're currently shipping. They've also updated the GRUB boot loader to automatically enable snapshots with the Btrfs file system, NVIDIA support was tweaked to enable S0ix sleep to provide low-power standby and their fork of arch-update with Cachy-Update is now available to give you a system tray indicator for available updates from official repositories and the AUR.</p>

<p>What is it? PEAK is a co-op game about climbing. You and friends live through a plane crash and end up stranded. So now you have to climb your way through various different biomes, each with their own hazards, as you collect items from luggage spread all over the place. It's incredibly funny with the right people.</p>
<p>The problem is - the controller support has been a little on the funky side, at times just not quite working correctly. However, earlier this month a big new update launched for it adding a new biome and new items. This and some following patches improved the controller support and text on Steam Deck too. So now, Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Voyagers free update released with modular Corvette ships you build yourself</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games launched another huge free update for the open world space survival game No Man's Sky, with a big new Corvette ship class you piece together.</p>
<p>Corvettes are a modular customizable multi-crew ship, so you can finally get up and walk around along with being able to bring you friends with you. These Corvettes can be outfitted with lots of different rooms and cockpits to make it a proper home away from home, along with a special mission radar for multi-crew missions. And, you can even get out and float around in space if that's your thing.</p>
<p>There's also a graphics upgrade for translucent surfaces like glass, NVIDIA DLSS4 support was added, there's new localised character lighting and so much more. With the Corvettes you can even park up somewhere up high in the atmosphere, and skydive out of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qHZLz1MW0aE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd79438401f6e1f5cdab17f6b46e36b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Simply incredible, I can't believe how much they're still adding to No Man's Sky all these years later. The amount of different features it has for players going solo or in groups is now pretty amazing.</p>
<p>There's also a "Deep Dive" video below narrated by Sean Murray, who just casually drops in a little info about their next game Light No Fire and how the tech is being developed for both games.</p>

      <title>Brutal survival game Vintage Story gets another huge update, plus work on an Adventure Mode announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story has some of the most interesting game mechanics I've seen in a survival game, but it's a little brutal - so I'm keen for this new Adventure Mode.</p>
<p>After the news a few months ago about the game Hytale being cancelled, the developers of Vintage Story <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/hytale-fans-you-are-very-welcome-here-r412/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted how</a> they were inviting developers to come work for them. This led to <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/vintage-story-adventure-mode-r413/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another post</a> in July talking about how they now plan to make an Adventure Mode for Vintage Story, although they haven't settled on a name yet.</p>
<p>For the latest big update to Vintage Story it adds in lots of new ocean content including 33 new fish, coral reefs and large waves. They've also improved clouds, added a bunch of new blocks, you can now tame and ride Elk, healing items now gradually heal instead of being instant, a player revive system for multiplayer was added, various story adjustments, you can now name your sailboat and attach shields and <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/v1210-story-chapter-2-redux-stable-r420/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lots more</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wsyy8pziGLI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0f2f5e19007effe97e40de6ee29b4cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wsyy8pziGLI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also disabled purchasing on their <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>, so now you have to get it direct (it's not on Steam or other stores). They claim that itch.io haven't paid them "for over 3 months". In their Discord, the Vintage Story developers expanded on this and said itch are "withholding a six figure sum of our revenue share".</p>

      <title>Helldivers 2 will send you deep underground in the next major update on September 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if the Halo ODST crossover for Helldivers 2 wasn't enough, now we're actually going underground too on Terminid Hive Worlds. Now I'm really excited and will absolutely have to get some hours back into this, which was a struggle before since Dune: Awakening practically took over my life for a while.</p>
<p>These Hive Worlds have been terraformed by the Terminids, with vast cave networks we'll need to dive into. And, since you're underground, no Super Destroyer to help you. This is all about the Gloom, the thick fog that covers the Hive Worlds which has also mutated the Terminids so there will be some new threats too.</p>
<p>Some new types of missions will come with the update too like escorting a mobile oil rig, which sounds just a little like Deep Rock Galactic. There will also be another new Premium Warbond with a bunch of new gear to unlock.</p>

      <title>iRacing announce they&#39;re developing an official INDYCAR game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>iRacing just announced a partnership with INDYCAR to develop an official game that will release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>And just like iRacing did for the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/iracing-arcade-announced-and-its-basically-circuit-superstars-2-with-licensed-cars-and-tracks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement of iRacing Arcade in the trailer</a>, they seem to be keeping the Steam Deck as a firm target with the logo clearly displayed in their main press image.</p>
<p>We don't exactly know a whole lot about this one right now as it has only just been announced. They have said it will include a robust, multilevel career mode, licensed drivers from the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and INDY NXT by Firestone, and online multiplayer. One little fun tidbit though is that it's being made with an enhanced version of the Orontes engine, which iRacing acquired <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/orontes-games-creator-of-drag-gets-acquired-by-iracing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when they bought Orontes Games</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1039515801756289363gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>âINDYCAR fans have long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles, and weâre excited to give them what theyâre looking for in 2026,â said Tony Gardner, president, iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations. âiRacing Studiosâ standalone INDYCAR title will offer all the excitement of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy. We are already very excited about how the game is coming together.â</p>
<p>âThe most competitive and challenging racing on the planet deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience,â said INDYCAR President J. Douglas Boles. âiRacing Studios is the ideal partner for us, trusted and known to our core fans and ready to share our sport with a wider and highly engaged audience.â</p>

      <title>Bazzite adds support for Ayaneo 3 and the AOKZOE A1X with work towards MSI Claw A8 and Legion Go 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the next generation of Linux gaming, has released a new build with lots of upgrades and support for more PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Newly supported in this release are the Ayaneo 3 and the AOKZOE A1X. For the Ayaneo 3, all that's missing is support for extra modules as they're waiting to get them so support should improve in future. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6138665991756288009gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ayaneo 3</em></p>
<p>The fun doesn't stop there though for this Linux system as Bazzite also has preliminary support for the MSI Claw A8 and the Lenovo Legion Go 2. On top of that all MSI Claw handhelds got an update to "improve controller after resume functionality and dual booting with Windows".</p>
<p>Even more with OLED devices like the OneXPlayer F1 Pro/EVA-1, Zotac Zone, and Ayaneo 3 receiving a patch to fix the screen turning off while adjusting the brightness. The Asus Z13 (2025) model is also now fully supported.</p>
<p>So much more on top of improved device support. The Handheld Daemon tool gained the ability to work with external controllers, they've improved Bazzite boot speed, along with some general performance improvements for gaming for all users.</p>
<p>See all in their <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/back-to-school-update-ayaneo-3-aokzoe-a1x-framework-desktop-performance-boot-time-improvements-bazaar-update/10520" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> and the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>The new Framework Laptop 16 brings AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series and modular GPU upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework just revealed the new Framework Laptop 16, which brings CPU and GPU upgrades to their popular modular laptop. This is probably one of the most exciting laptop hardware companies around, especially now with modular GPU upgrades possible.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now with you being able to configure the new Framework Laptop 16 with the Ryzen AI 7 350 or <br/>
Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 along with the new option for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 or AMD Radeon RX 7700S. Pricing starts at Â£1,499 for the DIY edition and Â£1,799 for the pre-built version.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-16-with-nvidia" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weâve spent the last two years working with the teams at AMD, NVIDIA, and Compal to not only make a new NVIDIA-powered Graphics Module, but also make it fully backwards compatible with the original Framework Laptop 16. That means any current owner can pick up the new module and get the latest generation of graphics!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're really beginning to show other hardware vendors how it's done. Enabling you to keep updating your existing hardware, instead of forcing you to buy an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>For the refresh they've also revamped the thermal system, along with upgrading the display to support NVIDIA G-SYNC. The AMD GPU was also refreshed with an updated thermal system. There's more too they also announced a new compact 240W USB-C adapter supporting the USB-PD 3.1 spec.</p>
<p>For the original Framework Laptop 16 they're reducing the price and keeping the Ryzen 7 versions in production as a lower cost option.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires the rights to five classic Ubisoft titles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Atari are continuing to acquire more IP and now they've managed to pull a bunch of games away from Ubisoft. They only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/atari-set-to-acquire-82-of-thunderful-group-ab-as-thunderful-announce-theyre-restructuring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently acquired most of Thunderful Group AB</a>.</p>
<p>In the press release it's noticed Atari have acquired all intellectual property rights for Cold Fear (2005), I Am Alive (2012), Child of Eden (2011), Grow Home (2015), and Grow Up (2016). Atari plans to re-release the titles under their own publishing label and they're looking at "updated formats, new content, and extended distribution channels".</p>
<p>âMillions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time,â said Deborah Papiernik, Vice President of New Business. âAtari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, weâre excited to see how theyâll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.â</p>
<p>âUbisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with â games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel,â said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari. âWeâre excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.â</p>

      <title>Match Shot Chimera blends together a shoot &#39;em up with clever match-3 mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Match-3 and blow everything up in Match Shot Chimera, a unique fusion of two rather different genres of games into something fun. There's a demo now available which has Native Linux support, and the developer recently confirmed that it will be releasing September 9th.</p>
<p>Some more info about it: "Match Shot Chimera is a match-3 shoot 'em up with roguelite elements. Match-3 to deal big damage and collect XP for leveling up your chimera's abilities, all while dodging a wild array of enemies and bullets! Unlock persistent upgrades and unlock new characters to try different play-styles and get further on your next run."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wZxwnAUW-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e25be27444646e0c145e5e2304088a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wZxwnAUW-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vertical shoot 'em up gameplay</strong> - Dodge through a bullet hell while powering up your weapons to bring down massive and bizarre match-block filled bosses.</p>
<p><strong>Match-3 to make enemies go boom </strong>- Enemies drop colored puzzle blocks. Match-3 to blow things up and get XP.</p>
<p><strong>Varied Upgrades</strong> - From exploding shot, new bullet patterns, and healing puzzle matches to shooting fatter, slower bullets, there are plenty of different upgrades to make your chimera's next build unique.</p>
<p><strong>Different weapons for every block color</strong> - Hold different blocks to shoot beam weapons, exploding bomb shot, homing missiles, and more. Switch at will to change weapons, match colors, and use your powers.Varied</p>
<p><strong>Multiple characters - </strong>Choose from multiple chimeras with different powers, stats and weapons. Focus-fire, drop shields, launch drones, and more!</p>
<p><strong>Randomized Levels - </strong>Varied levels are generated from hand-crafted blocks full of hand-tested randomizations. Each level has a different style, and is populated with a different pool of enemies, mini-bosses and bosses.</p>
<p><strong>Play again and again</strong> - Tough shoot 'em up gameplay and bullet dodging will demand skill and quick thinking.  But dying is just the beginning of another run where you can try again with different builds and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Upgrades </strong>- Collect ichor during runs and save up to upgrade your abilities, unlock new characters and change the structure of the levels themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Controller support</strong> - Fluid controls support just about any joypad you can plug in, or keyboards! Mice, too, if you're into that.</p>

      <title>Moonlight Pulse is a metroidvania set inside an immense interstellar organism now with a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set inside an immense interstellar organism, Moonlight Pulse looks like a fun metroidvania and recently it gained a Native Linux version. It was originally released back in April 2024, and now has an overall Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: "Team up, learn new abilities and explore a surreal world in this seamless 2D platforming adventure set within the body of a colossal spacefaring turtle. Traverse flowing veins, sparking neurons, and gastric hazards as the world itself breathes around you. Join the heroic Curative Agents, who fight to protect this strange sanctuary from a swarm of ever-hungry interstellar parasites."</p>
<p>Check out the original release trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Team of Heroes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategically <strong>switch between characters in an instant</strong> to make use of their <strong>unique combat and movement abilities</strong>.</li>
<li>Unlock new powers as you take a starring role in each character's ongoing story.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>A Living World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Journey through the lungs, stomach and heart of Aorasque, an immense interstellar organism.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive gamemode system </strong>with CTF support across almost every map.</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay enhancements </strong>- shield regeneration, soundtrack, and modern viewbobbing - some major, some subtle things, all from the internal developments made to the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Refined classic maps </strong>such as Crossfire &amp; Datacore - with in-universe lore adaptations, quality enhancements, details, smoother lighting, and more.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.5 gains an OEM ready system setup tool and KDE Linux is progressing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next release of KDE Plasma is due in October and the developers have been working non-stop on some great new features for the popular desktop.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/08/23/this-week-in-plasma-kde-initial-system-setup/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This Week in Plasma post</a>, developer Nate Graham mentioned the new "KISS" tool which stands for KDE Initial System Setup. Something I'm really surprised they didn't have before. It's a way for users to set up their account properly on a computer with KDE Plasma installed, but the install was not done by them (like buying from system builders).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7495854081756123384gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7495854081756123384gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9878793011756123386gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9878793011756123386gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully with features like this actually in, we're making progress towards more systems shipping with Plasma.</p>
<p>You might also notice in the first shot above, at the bottom it says "KDE Linux". That's because the KDE team are also working on an Arch-based "next-generation operating system showcasing KDE's software". It's nowhere near ready though, but the <a href="https://kde.org/linux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">placeholder website</a> is live. It's also a bit more like SteamOS and Bazzite, with it having an immutable base where main upgrades replace the system and you install other apps via things like Flatpak.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see what they come up with when it's actually properly ready.</p>

      <title>Retro x86-based machine emulator 86Box v5.0 brings a new integrated machine manager</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>86Box is a low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software, with a big new release out to make managing multiple systems easier.</p>
<p>Version 5.0 brings a new integrated machine manager, which they said is one of the most requested additions of all time for the project. While there are third-party apps to manage it, now for most people this should get the job done. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883128251756122862gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883128251756122862gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's a number of other enhancements in this release like mouse input and display output are now much smoother, they completely reworked the OpenGL Core rendering system with multiple shaders and support for configuring shaders through the user interface, there's support for a few more retro machines, support was added for emulating more proprietary CD-ROM drives plus various UI enhancements throughout.</p>

      <title>Bottles devs give more info on their funding from NLnet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the Bottles team announced they've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/bottles-app-for-running-windows-apps-games-on-linux-gets-ngi-zero-commons-funding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">granted funding by NLnet NGI Zero Commons</a> and now they've given more detail on what it means.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-08-16-bottles-and-nlnet/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new post</a> they clarify they haven't actually received anything yet as it now goes through a planning stage to define what budget they will be given and how it will be spent. Additionally, this funding is for Bottles Next, their total rework of the app and not for maintenance on the current Bottles app.</p>
<p>With that in mind the developers mention it "doesn't mean Bottles is financially secure", as the current existing Bottles app is still funded purely by donations. And, once Bottles Next is available, it will too "live on donations from the community" as while the funding they will eventually get from NLnet "is a huge support" it's finite.</p>
<p>Since the news of the funding broke they said they've "seen donations decline, especially recurring ones" which is a shame and note that "The funds donât cover servers, maintenance, or running costs. And without direct support, the risk is that Bottles will be overshadowed before Next is ready".</p>
<p>They also said they're working on a fresh update on the progress of Bottles Next and how development is going.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds planet customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open source evolution sim Thrive version 0.8.3 brings in some more customization in how you play, along with new additions to the gameplay. Just like playing the early stages of the classic game Spore, except with a lot more science behind it.</p>
<p>Now when you start a game you can actually tweak even more of it with planet customization, some of which can drastically change your play-through. Control things like world size, temperature, oceanic coverage, geological activity, climate instability and more options are planned to be added.</p>
<p>They've also added a set of achievements, various refinements to balancing and the Multicellular Stage prototype has seen some love too. On top of that they've added a new hydrogenosome organelle, a microbe movement ripple effect and more.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I and Tomb Raider II open source re-implementations updated with new graphics options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The TRX project that brings an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 has big new releases out now. It's split into two with TR1X for Tomb Raider I and TR2X for Tomb Raider 2 but they share a lot of the changes.</p>
<p>Amazing project to preserve more classic games and give them a fresh life, even with official modern ports it's nice to see open source still. You will need to official classic games for the data files to play with TRX which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The update for Tomb Raider 2 is especially big on graphics rendering changes bringing options for round shadows, skyboxes, brightness, anisotropy and vertical sync along with other general visual improvements. There's also upgrades to photo mode, along with additions to gameplay mechanics like an option to allow Lara to jump up or back when hanging from a ledge.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-13 released with video fixes for various games and new options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community compatibility layer GE-Proton for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck version 10-13 brings fixes for videos on various games with some new options.</p>
<p>Be sure to see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>
<p>All that's new in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>intro video playback fixed in Resident Evil 7</li>
<li>intro video playback fixed in Resident Evil 8<font color="#e0e0e0"><strong> (Editor Note: <em>they mean </em></strong></font><em><strong>Resident Evil Village)</strong></em></li>
<li>Upside down cinema video playback fixed in Sky: Children of the Light</li>
<li>Upside down video playback fixed in Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed</li>
<li>Two new environment variable options added:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_MEDIA_USE_GST=1</code> will tell proton to use the winegstreamer backend instead of the default winedmo backend (the winedmo backend was introduced in Proton 10 and is the current preferred video playback method). This can be useful for games with videos that may have worked in Proton 9 but regressed in Proton 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION=<orientation></orientation></code> can be any of the following: <code class="inline-code">vertical-flip</code>, <code class="inline-code">horizontal-flip</code>, <code class="inline-code">rotate-180</code>, <code class="inline-code">automatic</code>. This is useful if some games have videos that are upside down or otherwise not oriented correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example usage: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION=vertical-flip</code>. If you set PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION it will also automatically force the winegstreamer backend to be used, as manual orientation is not possible with winedmo.</p>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added to restore sound in One Piece Pirate Warriors</li>
<li>protonfix added to fix 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition multiplayer</li>
<li>protonfix added for GOG version of 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition</li>
<li>wine-wayland em-10 patches updated and rebased</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>upstream proton fixes imported</li>
</ul>

      <title>CARGO blends off-roading with an action-focused Mad Max like delivery sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CARGO is not your usual delivery sim. Blending together off-roading co-op madness in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>They really, badly, need to come up with a better name though. The full name of the game is "CARGO: Co-Op Delivery Simulator in Post Apocalyptic World" and uh â that's a ridiculous mouthful. There's already various games named some form of Cargo, so back to the drawing board with the naming.</p>
<p>Aside from that, love the idea of this. Mixing together elements of SnowRunner, Mad Max / Twisted Metal and more into something that really could be a lot of fun. Their initial announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NC77q9xiJBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c15c68882c64d7e406b032dba315efb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NC77q9xiJBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview.</strong> CARGO is a post-apocalyptic off-road autosim about moving critical supplies between survivors. Play solo or form <strong>4-player co-op</strong> convoys. Roles can be split (driver/defense/scout/utility); players can share seats (incl. mounted turrets) or bring separate vehicles into the same session.</li>
<li><strong>Driving &amp; Terrain.</strong> Physics-driven handling with meaningful setup impact: vehicle weight, tires, traction, suspension, engine, differentials. Biomes include cracked highways, deep mud, radiation zones, and sand-choked dunes.</li>
<li><strong>Encounters (PvE).</strong> Hostile raiders attempt to disable the rig and steal cargo. Choose when to evade, reroute, or fight; delivery failure is tied to cargo loss.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Customization and restoration define cars for combat, capacity, speed, or traversal. Swap tires/engines, add armor and defensive/offensive tools, expand trunk capacity. Progression unlocks new options; some upgrades are vehicle-specific. Derelict vehicles can be discovered and rebuilt piece by piece.</li>
<li><strong>Meta Progression.</strong> Start from a small garage and expand base facilities to unlock trading, new delivery types, restoration options, and eventually settlement-scale operations.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have fond memories of blasting through Star Fox 64 and Wild Blue might end up being the closest thing to it on PC.</p>
<p>The game was revealed originally back in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/heres-what-was-shown-off-during-the-humble-games-showcase-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Humble Games showcase earlier this year</a>, but we didn't have any actual footage until now. Developed by Chuhai Labs from Kyoto, Japan it was started by Nintendo veteran Giles Goddard who actually helped develop Star Fox. So this is really going back to their roots.</p>
<p>Check out the fancy new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dbkqVTkuPvA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5f5d4084841e9bcf6085bb3ad49b6f19.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dbkqVTkuPvA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) arrives September 19 for co-op PvE spaceship fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) actually looks incredible if you're in the market for a new co-op game and it arrives September 19th. It already works well on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck from previous demos, and the developers said they will be working on improving Steam Deck performance with Proton.</p>
<p>Check out their two brand new videos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="skSL_3-3Hb8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00a481a51a54c05035f98671a204fc46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/skSL_3-3Hb8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l0c2o0UdSgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b5701190c3713fa37b3db91d2665975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l0c2o0UdSgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jump across the universe</strong> - Select from a variety of hand crafted missions with random elements. No two runs will be exactly the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamlessly go on and off ship</strong> - Once youâve jumped with your ship, you can switch seamlessly between operating your ship, space walking and on-foot planetary exploration, it just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade, maintain, repair</strong> - Manage your ship as you scavenge for parts to upgrade or repair it, and adapt it to fit your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fly with a crew, or go solo</strong> - Jump Space is best enjoyed with friends, but solo adventurers are welcome too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manage Your Jump Ship</strong></p>
<p>Upgrade and customise your ship as you face off against the challenges of space exploration, and scavenge resources to ensure your survival. Reinforce your defences, adjust your energy output for speed or bolster your shipâs attack capabilities - the choice is yours.</p>
<p><strong>Immerse Yourself in Space</strong></p>
<p>Experience fluid gameplay as you switch from steering your ship out of an asteroid field to jetpacking towards an enemy vessel to sabotage its core. Seamlessly transition between exploration, combat and traversal.</p>
<p><strong>Improvise and Adapt; Together</strong></p>
<p>Go on missions with your friends and take on roles, from piloting to engineering and field exploration. Work together to overcome enemy attacks, extinguish fires on the command deck or adjust your shipâs power grid on the fly. There are no set classes in Jump Space, improvise and decide how you want to engage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now onto the bit that annoys me. Scroll down on Steam to see an AI notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p>
<p>Pre-generated voice cloning/Text-To-Speech where it makes sense creatively.<br/>
Placeholders will be replaced by real voice acting as development continues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least in this case, they do plan to put in real voice acting later.</p>

      <title>Let&#39;s Build a Dungeon sounds like such a fun idea as it hits 140,000 Steam wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm too stupid to make a game, but a game about managing a game studio building an MMORPG? Oh yeah, Let's Build a Dungeon sounds like my jam.</p>
<p>Seriously, Let's Build a Dungeon actually has such a fun sounding idea to it. Because it's not a management game like you would expect. Built by Springloaded, who also made the cute Let's Build a Zoo. You get to build up  a full game in what they say is a "true-to-life and ridiculous simulation of the games industry". Manage staff and development schedules, build up the actual world itself and eventuallyâ¦you even get to play your own game.</p>
<p>All of that while you sit back sipping a cola without the worry of a publisher suddenly running out on you.</p>
<p>Check out their brand new overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w9x1hGEJ-hw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45fc193bc2bfc1af95a8e11bf1e55ad0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w9x1hGEJ-hw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Design and build your very own MMO world, fit to be filled by hordes of virtual players</li>
<li>Manage the day-to-day running of your game studio, from hiring and firing to keeping your investors happy</li>
<li>Attract new virtual players to your MMO masterpiece by expanding your world, designing new quests and monitoring player journeys</li>
<li>Progress through the campaign to develop new items, environments and mechanics that bring your ideas to life</li>
<li>Playtest your RPG at any time to see the world through the eyes of a player</li>
<li>Mix-and-match quest styles for endless replayability</li>
<li>Customise using thousands of items, or design your own</li>
<li>Negotiate tough conversations with shareholders, staff, players and publishers to make meaningful choices that will impact the direction of your studio.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep Dish Dungeon looks like a great co-op dungeon crawler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a recent announcement from publisher Raw Fury, a dungeon crawler with an emphasis on exploration and player ingenuity. Playable solo or in online co-op, the trailer sold me pretty quickly with the overall theme of it.</p>
<p>Developed by Behold Studios who also made Chroma Squad, Knights of Pen and Paper and more games. As the name alludes, cooking a good hearty meal is a big part of the gameplay here. From Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a dungeon crawler and exploration game that rewards curiosity and resourcefulness. In an atmospheric environment, explore corridors, rooms and passageways solo or with up to three friends, and gather resources to improve your camping site. Craft tools and cook nourishing meals to bolster strength throughout the journey, and unravel the enigma that lies within the shadows.</p>
<p>Forage and scavenge as you traverse through the dungeon's bountiful depths. Between your journeys, return to camp and plan your next steps by the fire. Use the resources you find to craft new tools and cook a hearty meal. Remember that food is progress: over time, unlock recipes that have different effects on your stats.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong now finally having a release date</a>, Valve have managed to test it early and given it a Steam Deck Verified rating. It's also rated as SteamOS Compatible, since anything that runs on Steam Deck should run on other SteamOS systems unless they have silly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> (which this of course does not).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Valve's rating is actually using the Native Linux version of the game and not Proton. As you can see in the details on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Nice to see another exciting release actually having full Linux support.</p>

      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) now available for all developers with FidelityFX SDK 2.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have finally released FidelityFX SDK 2.0, which includes support for FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), so now all developers can use it.</p>
<p>Offering an easy way for developers to upgrade, it provides some pretty big improvements to image quality with their new Machine Learning based algorithm. It improves temporal stability, better preserve detail, and reduce ghosting and in many cases the difference is very noticeable. </p>
<p>As for the upgrade path AMD said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new release of AMD FSR 4 continues to use the FidelityFX API introduced in FSR 3.1, providing an easy update path for developers. New features are exposed using the extensibility of the FidelityFX API. AMD FSR 4 is available as prebuilt, signed DLLs as part of FidelityFX SDK 2.0 official releases to ensure stability and upgradability of DLLs, if allowed by individual game releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD FidelityFX SDK is open source available under the MIT license. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-fsr4-gpuopen-release/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for info.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods announce age verification for UK users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15346" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> they're adding an age verification requirement for certain mods, and it sounds like eventually for the EU too.</p>
<p>You can thank the UK Online Safety Act they legally have to follow, if they're to continue hosting "adult" themed mods for various games. This follows Discord, Reddit and many other sites being forced to do the same. They'll be using <a href="https://www.k-id.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">k-ID</a> for it, which is also used by Discord.</p>
<p>This won't be required for everyone, it will only appear when you try to access adult content hosted on Nexus Mods. They said EU users will "follow once laws in your region require it" and other countries as their laws come in. The only exemption is accounts over 10 years old will not be asked to age verify.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to verify and choose not to they said the content will simply be hidden.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://help.nexusmods.com/article/157-age-verification-faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ post</a> has more info. Nexus said it will begin next week.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases September 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming and soon too! On September 4th, the wait will finally be over for fans as confirmed today by Team Cherry. Finally, it took a while but hopefully the wait will have been worth it. Sure does look incredible.</p>
<p>Check out the official release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It was originally due to be an expansion for the original but simply grew too big. Their team spoke to Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), detailing why it took so long to arrive. The answer is pretty simple. There was no burnout or anything big happening behind the scenes, as developer Ari Gibson said "It was never stuck or anything. It was always progressing. It's just the case that weâre a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasnât any big controversial moment behind it." and they were having a bit too much fun designing and expanding it.</p>
<p>"We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing," Gibson said. "Because all we could really say is, 'Weâre still working on it.'"</p>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a whole new kingdom! Explore coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors as you ascend to the shining citadel at the top of the world.</li>
<li>Engage in lethal acrobatic action! Wield a whole new suite of deadly moves as you dance between foes in deadly, beautiful combat.</li>
<li>Craft powerful tools! Master an ever-expanding arsenal of weapons, traps, and mechanisms to confound your enemies and explore new heights.</li>
<li>Solve shocking quests! Hunt down rare beasts, solve ancient mysteries and search for lost treasures to fulfil the wishes of the downtrodden and restore the kingdomâs hope. Prepare for the unexpected!</li>
<li>Face over 150 all-new foes! Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights, defeat them all with bravery and skill!</li>
<li>Challenge Silk Soul mode! Once you conquer the kingdom, test your skills in an all-new mode that spins the game into a unique, challenging experience.</li>
<li>Experience a stunning orchestral score! Hollow Knightâs award-winning composer, Christopher Larkin, returns to bring melancholy melodies, symphonic strings and heart-thumping, soul strumming boss themes to the adventure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not entirely clear if it will have Native Linux support like the original. I've emailed the developer to ask. Otherwise there's Valve's excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/7-years-later-valves-proton-has-been-an-incredible-game-changer-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer</a>. <strong>Update 22/08/25</strong>: the developers added Linux system requirements after this was published, and it's now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified with the Native version</a>.</p>

      <title>The original Splitgate will live on with player-hosted matches</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least this is one online game that won't be entirely killed off. Splitgate, the original one, will live on by allowing players to host matches.</p>
<p>If you missed the recent news, the developers announced they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/splitgate-2-is-going-back-to-beta-with-the-original-shutting-down-as-1047-games-have-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reworking Splitgate 2</a> and they were going to entirely sunset the original Splitgate and were only exploring the possibility of letting players host matches with the dedicated servers turned off. Now, in a <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official site, they've confirmed an update is coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6581120651755784135gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>To save you clicking about, here's the important bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's Happening</strong></p>
<p>Starting August 29, the original Splitgate will be moving to peer-to-peer as we focus our resources on rebuilding Splitgate 2. We know this game means the world to so many of you and we're not about to let that disappear. This means you'll still be able to play matches and experience the magic that made Splitgate special, just in a different way.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, we have also added content to the game that was previously unreleased, stockpiled, or Work In Progress (WIP).</p>
<ul>
<li>13 WIP blockout arena maps -- Including some of the first maps shown in Splitgate 2</li>
<li>Simulation Juliet (an unreleased Takedown map)</li>
<li>Everyone gets access to all cosmetics -- For this reason, the Battle Pass, Rewards Center, Store, and Drops have been sunset</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also made sure that community-favorite features remain playable, including Races and Map Creator!</p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>A player will host a match and act as the server. Other players can view the game in the server browser and join from there. If the host has saved Custom Maps, then those maps will be playable for the lobby.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful is a very colourful looking delivery mystery adventure from MythicOwl and Palworld publisher Pocketpair Publishing. A demo is coming next month!</p>
<p>In a Steam announcement the developer said it will be shown off at PAX West between August 28th - September 1st where visitors will be able to try it. At some point after, a public demo will arrive on Steam that will be "100% compatible with Steam Deck". They also confirmed they're "working on a native Linux version that will be available on full game release in 2026".</p>
<p>Every bit of footage I see on this just makes me want more. See some recent gameplay below:</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper set for full online and local multiplayer with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiplayer is finally coming to the excellent Dome Keeper, in a major upcoming update from developer Bippinbits. This is in addition to the developer working on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/i-cant-wait-to-fire-that-massive-cannon-in-pvkk-planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent looking PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.</p>
<p>Giving more detail in a Steam post it will include Cooperative Play, Competitive Play, Local Splitscreen and Online Multiplayer. It's even getting a Dome versus Dome mode, which sounds like a lot of fun and a very different experience to the base game.</p>
<p>What's not entirely clear is when it will arrive. All modes are now in the code and working, but they're going through and fixing various bugs as they find them. At some point a big playtest is coming to Steam to help hunt for problems.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Soulblaze is a new dice rolling creature-collecting roguelite you can try right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sword &amp; Quill have announced the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeinmakesgames/soulblaze-a-hand-drawn-creature-collecting-roguelite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> for Soulblaze, a fresh dice rolling creature-collecting roguelite and there's a demo up right now. Another game made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>This sounds like a good one for people who don't have endless amounts of time. It's a bite-sized creature collecting experience. As the developer explained: "Enjoy the fun of picking a starter and building your team without having to commit dozens of hours. Runs are fast-paced and always different, each of your teams unique every time. You won't run out of action points, you won't have to walk to the last healing provider over and over, you just keep going... until you win? Yes, win!"</p>
<p>It will be supported on Linux, macOS and Windows. Check out the full Kickstarter video to get some more details on it:</p>

<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Capture and train unique hand-drawn creatures that each have their own passive ability.</li>
<li>Combat hybrid between classic creature-collecting RPGs and TTRPG dice-roll mechanics.</li>
<li>Upgrade and customize techniques by combining tags to create your own individual builds.</li>
<li>90s-retro + fantasy: flash drives, sticker albums, and magic, baby!</li>
<li>Twitch integration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're hoping to get at least â¬20,000 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeinmakesgames/soulblaze-a-hand-drawn-creature-collecting-roguelite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> by September 19th.</p>

<p>The main highlights of what's coming:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Forsaken Powers rebalanced.</li>
<li>New combat mechanics &amp; combat improvements.</li>
<li>New equipable item type: Trinkets.</li>

      <title>Story-based survival strategy game Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting a brand new Star Trek: Voyager game and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Battlestar Galactica game</a>? This is what dreams are made of. <em>Someone pinch me, this can't be real. Janeway who? Look at me, I'm the captain now.</em></p>
<p>According to the blurb it blends "exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices" along with "crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe â with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities". Each play-through is different with it being a roguelite and so you get to play out various different fantasies with it.</p>
<p>I will make every attempt to turn the Borg into my friends. And finally give Kim that promotion. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s-0brgSYDEM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a52e98e3daaf71254bc6c47a75e9507.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s-0brgSYDEM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>âStar Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown is a project driven by passionâboth for storytelling and for the legacy of Star Trek,â says Jonas HÃ¼sges, COO at Daedalic Entertainment. âWeâre excited to bring the U.S.S. Voyager crew back into the spotlight in a way that feels true to canon while offering new narrative frontiers to explore.â</p>
<p>âAs lifelong fans of Star Trek, weâre thrilled to contribute to this iconic universe,â adds Daniel Bernard, Game Director at gameXcite. âThis game isnât just about nostalgiaâitâs about giving players the conn and letting them chart their own course through the unknown.â</p>

      <title>Paradox announced the updated, expanded, and remastered Surviving Mars: Relaunched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sci-fi fans are eating good lately. Surviving Mars: Relaunched was announced by Paradox Interactive with Haemimont Games back for it.</p>
<p>It will include enhanced graphics, a new UI,and new content never before seen in the original. Plus all the previously released DLC from expansions to cosmetic bits all included together in one package. No release date given other than "soon" and it will have a "substantial discount for owners of the original Surviving Mars".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cYdb13fqECo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c3b50dd9ce2d268f0380d3b04fa3ad6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cYdb13fqECo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We don't know yet if it will continue the Native Linux support like the original, and Paradox haven't yet replied to my question about it. So it's possible you may have to use Valve's Proton for it on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Award-Winning Martian Colonization Game, Remastered: Players must overcome the challenges of building a habitable, life-sustaining colony in a hostile environment, bringing in human colonists, and keeping them alive long enough to become self-sustaining. Relaunched brings a reworked UI to players for easier access to their toolset and upgraded graphics fidelity and lighting for modern systems.</li>
<li>The Full Expansion Catalog: Compete with other colonies with Space Race, introduce Animal Life with Project Laika, and terraform the martian desert with Green Planet - along with all major and minor expansions, cosmetics, and radio stations released for the original game.</li>
<li>New Gameplay Feature: The âMartian Assemblyâ update adds colony factions to the game, adding playersâ greatest challenge yet to the unforgiving environment of Mars: politics. Colonists will adopt agendas and personal demands, allowing players to shape the society of their coloniesâ future. Establish laws and policies, and even push for full independence from Earth!</li>
<li>Expansive Mod Support: Craft your own buildings, parks, or even a sci-fi mystery to share through the gameâs extensive and convenient modding tools. Modding is integrated into the game across all platforms, making it easy to browse, install, share, and manage mods without ever leaving your colony.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The base price will be $39.99/Â£34.99/â¬39.99 but owners of the original get it for $19.99/Â£17.50/â¬19.99.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.1 released for open source Linux graphics drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.1 was released on August 20th bringing some essential bug fixes for the current latest feature release of open source Linux graphics drivers. The Mesa developers generally tell people to wait until this first bug fix before upgrading production systems, as new feature releases always have a little something they might miss.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.2.1.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> the main bug fixes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>d3d10umd: Build regression on 25.2.0-rc1</li>
<li>nvk/nak regression: memory_model.message_passing fails on KeplerA</li>
<li>[ANV] dEQP-VK.api.copy_and_blit.copy_commands2.image_to_buffer_transfer_queue.2d_images.whole_r32g32b32_uint_linear and possibly others asserts on LNL</li>
<li>Build dependency on intel_wa.h missing in Intel vulkan driver</li>
<li>Missing polygons/vertices in CS2 on BMG</li>
<li>`vn_ring`: use-after-release crash after `vn_ring_destroy` on Virtio-Vulkan</li>
<li>venus: vkmark âwinsys headless segfault (regression)</li>
<li>Vulkan headless WSI crashes when initializing swapchain on Asahi Linux running Apple M1 Max</li>
</ul>

      <title>Leaks again hint at Valve doing a proper Steam Machine Console</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We are again seeing leaks of a potential future console from Valve, which is exciting considering how well the Steam Deck has done.</p>
<p>Valve are always working on something though, and seeing leaks doesn't mean what they're currently working on will ever actually release. Valve did also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-latest-valve-steam-console-rumour-with-amd-rdna4-can-be-safely-ignored-heres-why/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously completely dismiss another rumour</a> but this one at least has some more substance to it.</p>
<p>The what: as reported by <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1957931577444561350" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SadlyItsBradley</a> on X, noting that a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Geekbench</a> result had appeared for "Valve Fremont". Going by the details it's currently using a "Hawk Point 2" CPU noted as "AMD Custom CPU 1772" featuring 6 Cores and 12 Threads running at 3.20 GHz.</p>
<p>What makes it a little odd though is the listing being Windows 11 Pro, along with it <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> having a dedicated RX 7600 GPU. It would be thoroughly odd if it was Windows-based, given all their work on Linux and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/7-years-later-valves-proton-has-been-an-incredible-game-changer-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amazing Proton compatibility layer</a>. This is likely just some testing machine that won't match up to what the real specifications will be, if it <em>ever</em> does release.</p>
<p>Question is though â how did this listing appear? It wasn't just the once either, but <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390144" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">twice</a>. Did someone at Valve accidentally allow it to be published? Did Valve do it on purpose to generate more leak hype and speculation? Then again, to cover all sides - this "Valve Fremont" <em>might</em> not even be a real listing actually coming from a Valve test.</p>
<p>How <em>could</em> they actually make it a success? I wrote about what I thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve would need for a new Steam Machine previously</a>, and going back â most of what I said still remains true. Mostly, because they do now have the dedicated SteamOS rating system now at least for other devices.</p>
<p>Valve have built up a lot of goodwill and dedicated customers with the Steam Deck, and we've come a truly long way since the failure of the first Steam Machines so they could quite easily make it a success. As long as it's priced right, and performs well enough with people having access to all their existing Steam games thanks again to Proton if it used SteamOS. We definitely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need that Steam Controller 2</a> as well that's for sure.</p>
<p>What are your current thoughts on a future TV Steam Machine from Valve?</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve for comment but we're unlikely to get a response on such a thing.</em></p>

      <title>7 years later, Valve&#39;s Proton has been an incredible game-changer for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has been 7 years since Valve revealed Proton, their compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux systems. <em>What an incredible time it has been.</em></p>
<p>Hard to imagine Linux gaming without Proton now isn't it? Unless games use some funky video codecs or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, a lot of the time they do just work with the click of a button. We went from getting a handful of indie games and some AAA scraps from porting companies, to multiple tens of thousands of games â we're spoilt for choice on what to actually play. Going by ProtonDB there's at least 15,855 games rated playable by at least two reports, and Valve's Deck Verified system shows 21,694 games rated at least playable for SteamOS / Steam Deck. Incredible numbers and that's only what have actually seen some checks.</p>
<p>I still <em>vividly</em> remember the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, shaking with excitement on what it would mean for the future. It has opened up a world of possibilities, where you (for the most part) don't need to be attached to Windows to play some of the best games around.</p>
<p>Valve's commitment to Linux and open source is very much self-serving of course, they are a company with goals. All of this was progress towards creating their own ecosystem with the likes of the Steam Deck / SteamOS and other potential hardware to come. Linux desktop users are mostly just along for the ride and reap all the benefits.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the work with Proton and the Steam Deck, the Linux user share on Steam is also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the cusp of breaking through 3%</a> which is impressive considering the massive mountain that is Windows. You don't beat or even get remotely close to such an entrenched system overnight, movement like this just takes time. Slow and steady wins the race right? Valve continue playing the long game here.</p>
<p>What's truly incredible about Proton though is how it gives Valve a set platform to continue building on. So when we hopefully see a Steam Deck 2, or a Steam Machine TV console, it will be plug and play with all the existing games. Linking into why I love the whole idea of Valve using Linux with Proton, SteamOS / Steam Deck over traditional consoles is just having access to all the same games - no need to buy them again.</p>
<p>And with more publishers like Microsoft and Sony pushing their games on Steam too, we all win.</p>
<p>Here's to Valve and Proton, 7 years on. Cheers!</p>

      <title>I can&#39;t wait to fire that massive cannon in PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant really rolls off the tongue doesn't it? Is it basically Dome Keeper in 3D? Well, sort-of but not quite. Either way, it looks fantastic and the latest trailer gives us a fresh glimpse into the world of firing a massive planetary defence cannon.</p>
<p>Working for an autocratic regime and confined to your bunker, it's your mission to manually control that huge weapon with various buttons, levers and more. It's not just you sat in front of a screen though, you can actually get up and walk around this bunker with customizations, and you'll be dealing with various moral dilemmas. There's also some secrets to the bunker to explore and discover.</p>
<p>Check out the fresh trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HYoehpASQMA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b207f1379a87aade70c2025b678619a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HYoehpASQMA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We still don't entirely know if it will have Native Linux support. It's built with Godot and their FAQ still just mentions that Linux is a "pretty safe bet" since Godot works well. Just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>I'm excited by this one, what a great idea and the new footage looks awesome. Dome Keeper really sucked me in, so I expect more great things from Bippinbits. Their booth at Gamescom is also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smitner.studio/post/3lwtdd3oiqs26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">just awesome</a>.</p>

      <title>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster is the next Nightdive Studios release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios announced they're doing Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, reviving the 1997 classic from LucasArts. People were speculating this was coming, since the original on Steam got named to "Classic" before the official announcement claim.</p>
<p>More about it: "Saddle up and ride back into the Wild West with the gunslinging ex-Marshal, James Anderson, and face off against the good, the bad, and the even worse this side of the Mississippi as you work to uncover a twisted plot of greed and corruption. With your trusty six-shooting .45 Revolver, Scoped .44 Rifle, 10-Gauge Shotgun, and good ol' Sawed-Off 12-Gauge Shotgun, you'll be packin' plenty of firepower to take out all manner of outlaw varmints."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qx4O0OmaFNg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6742019830ee34ee959da053147bb7a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qx4O0OmaFNg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: âFollowing our release of Star Warsâ¢: Dark Forces Remaster last year, we are overjoyed to continue our relationship and work closely with the amazing team at Lucasfilm Games,â said Stephen Kick, Nightdiveâs Studio Head. âThe influence of the original Outlaws + Handful of Missions on the FPS genre cannot be overstated, in terms of gameplay and narrative prowess. Weâre honored to help bring this iconic Western adventure to modern audiences.â</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engaging first-person ground combat featuring five weapon types</li>
<li>Up to 4K 120FPS visuals on PC, PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S</li>
<li>Modern gamepad support adds a new weapon wheel, rumble, and motion/gyro controls</li>
<li>Trophies and Achievements on Windows PC via Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles</li>
<li>A Vault filled with golden behind-the-scenes nuggets that fans will enjoy</li>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition fixes desyncs between Windows and Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition released recently and it works great on Linux, even better now the online works properly too.</p>
<p>Thanks to Valve's Proton, we have access constantly to games new and old. But, sometimes, they come with issues. Much like previous RTS games from Relic Entertainment, it launched with a desync issue between Windows and Linux (Proton). However, unlike previous games, Relic actually released a patch to fix it! Just goes to show how far we've come that developers are truly now paying attention.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8xFKCaztKIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b3d7ac548714a183dba48a1e5a55e2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8xFKCaztKIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Noted in Hot Fix 2.0.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could not see Multiplayer game lobbies hosted by a player using a different audio language (English, German, French, and Russian).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the game from loading the correct language using the GOG Galaxy launcher for those using Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. </li>
<li><strong>Fixed a desync that led to a crash in Multiplayer games where players on Windows &amp; Linux (SteamDeck / Proton) were playing together.</strong></li>
<li>Fixed two crashes that could occur during singleplayer or multiplayer when numerous enemy units were starting to move while the player is also moving the camera.</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes that could occur when pre-rendered movies started for players using older operating systems. </li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during loading screens or while saving the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a fatal scar error in Winter Assault Disorder Mission 1 when Gorgutz was killed immediately before a cut-scene triggered.</li>
<li>Fixed a scripting error that prevented Listening Posts from being buildable in Dawn of War Mission 1 when two strategic points were captured at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could sometimes prevent objective locations from being correctly highlighted by arrow FX in Campaign missions.</li>
<li>Updated Gridkeys controls to fix a keybind conflict on Orks, Space Marines, and Imperial Guard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can all enjoy one of the best RTS games ever, with lots of enhancements and actually working multiplayer between platforms without having to resort to special external fixes. What a time to be alive.</p>

      <title>iRacing Arcade announced and it&#39;s basically Circuit Superstars 2 with licensed cars and tracks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>iRacing have announced iRacing Arcade made in partnership with Original Fire Games the developers of Circuit Superstars.</p>
<p>Certainly seems like this could have been Circuit Superstars 2, with iRacing mentioning how this "all-new title blends the strengths of both studios to create a unique racing experience thatâs fun for all". It will also come with a stylized version of officially licensed vehicles and tracks.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QDQg-MjglNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25a2710700195311ceb3a55ed32d61ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QDQg-MjglNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, their system requirements on Steam note it will run on "LCD Steam Deck equivalent or higher". Nice to see more developers using the Steam Deck directly like this, as a set specification platform for performance.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features of iRacing Arcade include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approachable racing for all:</strong> Racers of all ages will enjoy iRacing Arcadeâs mix of playful art and fun physics, giving players a driving experience that is easy to pick up but rewarding to master.</li>
<li><strong>Build your motorsport legacy: </strong>Climb the racing ladder to earn resources and boosts that improve your results and build your racing empire from a backyard garage to a bold, fully customizable palace.</li>
<li><strong>Officially licensed cars and tracks: </strong>From iconic vehicles like the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup to top tracks like Imola and AutÃ³dromo Hermanos Rodriguez, real-world race fans will enjoy a unique take on their favorite cars and circuits.</li>
<li><strong>More ways to race:</strong> Along with your single-player racing dynasty, compete in global time trials and push for the highest possible spot on the leaderboard.</li>

      <title>Death By Scrolling is the next game from Ron Gilbert of Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MicroProse Software are on a bit of a roll lately for their publishing, now they've announced Death By Scrolling from Ron Gilbert of Terrible Toybox.</p>
<p>More about it: set in the bizarre depths of Purgatory â now under new management, Death By Scrolling challenges players to race upward through endless levels, battling quirky underworld monsters, dodging deadly traps, and staying just ahead of the relentless Grim Reaper. The ultimate goal? Amass 10,000 gold to pay the Ferrymanâs outrageous riverâcrossing fee and finally escape the afterlife. Check out the first proper trailer for it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fXIGtCVH5Wo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3746ef19412f15cac41826fd985aaeeb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fXIGtCVH5Wo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will choose from a varied cast of unique characters, each with distinct perks and abilities, and take on a nonstop vertical sprint where time, gravity, and death itself are constant enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Along the way, theyâll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battle <strong>bizarre creatures</strong> and demonic bosses in fastâpaced combat.</li>
<li>Gather <strong>loot</strong>, gems, and powerâups from eccentric vendors.</li>
<li>Complete <strong>bonus runs and side quests</strong> for extra rewards.</li>
<li>Compete on global Steam <strong>leaderboards </strong>to prove their purgatorial skill.</li>
<li>Enjoy a<strong> tongueâinâcheek</strong> take on afterlife bureaucracy, with cheeky dialogues and playful narrationâhallmarks of Ron Gilbertâs signature style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Working with Ron Gilbert on Death By Scrolling is an honor," said Davide Pessach, CMO at MicroProse. "Heâs brought his trademark humor, sharp design, and quirky worldâbuilding to a completely new genre for him. We canât wait for players to experience it."</p>
<p>Looks like it will have Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes announced and has me terribly excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is a new strategy game from Dotemu and developer Alt Shift releasing in Q1 2026.</p>
<p>I cannot even begin to tell you how happy I am to see this. The modern Battlestar Galactica is easily my all-time favourite sci-fi series. If you haven't watched it â you should fix that.</p>
<p>There is already a Battlestar strategy game with Battlestar Galactica Deadlock, that's really quite good! But this Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes brings more of a roguelite experience that "pays tribute to the fundamental aspects of the franchise". Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZJsmoFJE-vs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb5914df03b41748eec99353af35d975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZJsmoFJE-vs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gosh, that music, what a perfect bit of marketing for anyone who is a Galactica fan. And recreating the intro from the series in the trailer for the game? That was clever. Gimme gimme gimme. My expectations weren't particularly high until watching the trailer, since it's a series I love so much but now I really am interested. A universe that just deserves to be expanded â there's a ridiculous amount of background lore that they can dive into.</p>
<p>From the press email announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em>, you command a fleet of spaceships fleeing humanityâs settled worlds, known as the Twelve Colonies. You must escape annihilation by the Cylons, a sentient robotic species that has turned against its human creators. The only hope of survival lies in reaching the mighty ship known as the Battlestar Galactica, but enduring the Cylons attack while preventing political dissent or in-fleet disputes from dividing your forces will test your ability to manage multiple crises at once â including identifying imposters that may already be among your ranks.</p>
<p>Every difficult choice made in <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> brings consequences, and each run varies in its challenges. Encounter planets and galactic points of interest, decide whether to spend precious resources addressing incidents within your fleet or upgrading your forces, and make the most of your crewâs time while preparing for assault; enemy Cylon ships will close in with each action and turn you take.</p>
<p>Once the deadly Cylons make contact with your forces, a battle begins. True to the franchiseâs theme of escaping an overwhelming enemy, <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> features innovative core combat gameplay centered around a simple but key concept of survival: âresist until you can jump.â Deploy fighters from your hangars and direct them in real-time combat scenarios to dispatch the Cylons, minimizing damage to your central ship while wielding its onboard defenses against your gravest threats. Endure until you can flee to another sector of the galaxy, choosing your destination (and potential rewards) based on your most dire needs.</p>
<p>Each run in <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> offers new lessons as you adapt to defy your brutal odds of survival, and your tactical options broaden as you unlock additional squadrons, weapons and traits as well as meta upgrades to benefit future runs. Make decisions that meaningfully alter your fleetâs fate, lead your fighters through high-risk battles, and jump to new sectors before the Cylons turn your ships into astral debris. With humanityâs haven in the Twelve Colonies now uninhabitable, your steadfast tactical leadership is your crewâs only hope of surviving the journey to humankindâs last hope, the Battlestar Galactica. So say we all.</p>

      <title>Competitive vehicle shooter World of Tanks: HEAT announced with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A competitive multiplayer game announced with Steam Deck support right away? Not something we see often! World of Tanks: HEAT has me cautiously interested.</p>
<p>It's from Wargaming Group Limited so it's going to be another free to play live service game full of micro-transactions, because of course it is. Hopefully at least it goes better than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/steel-hunters-is-another-live-service-casualty-as-its-shutting-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">STEEL HUNTERS which they're shutting down</a>, let's see how long this one lives. To be fair, Wargaming's other games are pretty popular.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought it was still pretty neat to see Steam Deck mentioned directly along with other platforms at the end of the trailer. The trailer which, while in-engine, is <em>not</em> actual gameplay. So it's about as useful as glass hammer in terms of getting even the slightest idea if it looks fun or not.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7VXeTK3-lMA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63618980f98abd1eafd69f43520f9c52.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7VXeTK3-lMA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They claim it will have no pay to win, hopefully they actually stick by that. More from their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every vehicle in HEAT is piloted by an elite agent, each with their own backstory, playstyle, and unique active ability. Whether you're the type to hold the line, call the shots, or dive deep behind enemy lines, there's a role for you here.</p>
<h3><strong>Built for Competitive Play</strong></h3>
<p>World of Tanks: HEAT is designed from the ground up to feel tight, responsive, and intuitive. Expect intense matches that get to the action fast and reward strategy, squad-based tactics, and role mastery.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fight across a wide range of dynamic maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate with your squad to capture objectives and dominate control points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master your favorite vehicles and unlock new looks and loadouts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No endless grinds. No pay-to-win. Just raw, skill-based competition, and all the chaos that comes with it.</p>

      <title>SCS Software have next-gen trucking competition with Road Kings from Saber Interactive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When you think of a trucking sim you probably think American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 but here comes some big competition with Road Kings.</p>
<p>Announced by Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment, Road Kings invites players to take the driverâs seat of a 40-ton semi in a realistic simulation, and deliver goods across the vast and vibrant landscapes of the American South.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-DgAnfPjijY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dca509b5d97c4835ad56e6009788df87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-DgAnfPjijY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>âWe are thrilled to start on another exciting journey with our longtime partner Saber Interactive,â says John Bert, Managing Director at Focus Entertainment Publishing. âRoad Kings is a project that truly combines Saberâs technical expertise with Focus Entertainmentâs passion for immersive simulation experiences. Together, we're aiming to deliver a deeper gameplay experience and a more dynamic adventure for players. We canât wait for fans to get behind the wheel and discover everything this new title has to offer.â</p>
<p>"As a native Floridian, it is awesome to see parts of my home state recreated in Road Kings. â I spent hundreds of hours on those roads as a kid and now we are bringing them to life in a game that creates a new category in the simulation space. âI am so happy to be a part of this journey and personally loved playing the game." said Matthew Karch, Saber CEO.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South. Manage multiple jobs, trailers, and routes, from busy Jacksonville to the shady streets of historic Savannah.</p>
<p>Starting as a rookie driver, encounter cunning rivals, helpful allies, dangerous weather, and treacherous roads as you take on long-haul deliveries to carve out a reputation as a veteran owner-operator in <em>Road Kings' </em>immersive world.</p>
<p><strong>Grow your reputation, push through dangerous situations, face down rivals, and take on long-haul deliveries in a living, reactive world.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take control of your truck in a next-gen simulation, where every aspect matters, from weight, wear, brakes, torque, tires, and transmissions, to dynamic weather and road surfaces. Drive long distances in faithfully recreated, customizable branded trucks.</li>
<li>Dive into a changing world, where a ruthless corporation is expanding across the South, threatening catastrophe in the name of profit. When disaster strikes, only you can make it through. Rescue communities, deliver critical supplies, and prove that out on the road, a helping hand can make all the difference.</li>
<li>Make your own Road Kings story by earning reputation with drivers, dispatchers, and agencies. Choose a path to success by diversifying clients, or become the star vendor for just a few. Go further with asynchronous multiplayer: join or create a company, and climb the global leaderboards.</li>
<li>Hit the open road, traveling through breathtaking landscapes inspired by the real-life Florida-Georgia border. Navigate interstates with road signs, mind your diesel, watch for troopers, and follow service regulations, as cutting corners can hit your wallet, your clocks, and your reputation.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 launches October 21 but you have to pay extra for all the content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 from Paradox finally has a release date with October 21, but it gets expensive if you want all the content.</p>
<p>Paradox games have become a bit of a meme on the level of DLC included, but with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 they're pushing it further. There's three different editions of the game, the one with all of the actual content at release is a surprising Â£74.99. That's because, for some reason, they've separated two clans into a DLC which they've put into the "Premium Edition".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TrAVDT7maJE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b069870430fdaa4b694b9afbb6c8332.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TrAVDT7maJE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 players will experience the game's narrative through two alternating playable characters: Elder vampire Phyre and Malkavian detective Fabien. After centuries of torpor, a deep state of vampiric slumber, Phyre awakens in modern-day Seattle with a mysterious mark that has locked away their Elder abilities and Fabienâs voice echoing in their head. As Phyre, players meet the cityâs ruling Kindred vampires, each with their own motivations, and uncover Seattleâs dark secrets while reclaiming their lost vampiric powers.</p>
<p>Between nights, as Phyre rests, dreams and voices from Fabien's past take hold. Emerging as Fabien, players enter a neo-noir 1920s Seattle and use his Malkavian abilities to unravel the mystery behind his murder. Solving the case proves challenging, as Fabien's fractured perception of reality, a trait of his Malkavian blood, makes it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. </p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines 2 is the successor to the cult-classic Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines (2004). Bloodlines 2 plunges players into Seattle's dark underbelly, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy. Players meet compelling characters, navigate complex political relationships, stalk the city streets for prey, and engage in intense combat while balancing their thirst for mortal blood. </p>
<p>The base game includes four clans, each with its own distinct playstyles, outfits, and Disciplines: the rebellious Brujah, blood sorcery masters Tremere, justice-driven Banu Haqim, and the persuasive Ventrue. Players must remain mindful of their surroundings or risk breaking the Masquerade â the absolute law of secrecy that keeps vampire society hidden from humanity.</p>

      <title>Europa Universalis V set to release November 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Europa Universalis V from Paradox Interactive now has a confirmed release date for November 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/europa-universalis-v-from-paradox-will-only-support-windows-no-linux-or-macos-this-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As confirmed previously</a> though, Paradox have dumped both Native Linux and macOS support as they're now just focusing on Windows. Hopefully their latest engine will work well in Proton so at least Linux gamers won't entirely miss out on the latest grand-strategy game.</p>
<p>From the press release: "Developed by the Barcelona-based Paradox Tinto under the direction of Paradox co-founder Johan Andersson, Europa Universalis V is a continuation of the seriesâ record of deep, quality strategy gaming, but also a major departure from the previous titles. The new game moves further from the gameâs boardgame roots, and embraces population simulator models that have been explored in other Paradox games."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nP59vpuEJx8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2369c69de56c60b21597a52d7a44540b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nP59vpuEJx8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New âpopâ based system: </strong>A regionâs population is reflected by pop units, varying in culture, religion, and social position. A prosperous society will see the population grow, while plague and war can prove costly to the core of your game.</li>
<li><strong>Earliest Starting Date in Europa Universalis history,</strong> beginning with the world of 1337. The French and English are about to start the Hundred Yearsâ War, the Yuan dynasty thrives in China, and the Black Death has yet to happen. Guide a nation through 500 years of history, written by your decisions.</li>
<li><strong>The Biggest Paradox Map</strong> ever uses a more accurate projection of the globe and small province units. This means greater fidelity to the historical world that Europa Universalis V represents and more variety in the strategies available to the player.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Economic System</strong> including multiple goods and resources in each province. Resources can be fed into a production system, creating key goods for your society or for trade in regional and global markets.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Research Game:</strong> Unlock new technologies and ideas across diplomatic, administrative and military realms. Progress along each research branch will allow new weapons, new industries, and new ways to organize your realm.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Government System:</strong> Give tasks to your cabinet advisors to ease your rule, adopt new laws and national characteristics, and keep the factions of your nation in line by doling out privileges to various Estates.</li>
<li><strong>New Military System</strong> that draws soldiers from your population. Raise the levies and watch commerce grind to a halt, or hire mercenaries to fill your ranks. Slowly develop a professional standing army and organize your battlefield posture as you fight for territory and glory.</li>
<li><strong>And more:</strong> Historical situations to immerse you in real world events, multiple religions and government types, greater importance of characters and dynastic relationships, and dramatic world changing events.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Woolhaven expansion announced for Cult of the Lamb</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gimme! I know a good few people who will be terribly excited for the announced Woolhaven expansion for Cult of the Lamb. Set to arrive in "early 2026" it's a big one too.</p>
<p>The base game works great on Desktop Linux and is Steam Deck Verified. I've put a lot of hours in and can easily recommend it. Absolutely incredible style so I'm quite hyped for this expansion! You'll need to have played a lot of it to access the expansion, as it's only available near the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EehS0AGcLkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4f7a95dc21d4941b0dd6f6bde13150d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EehS0AGcLkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Expansion Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Winter descends, and a long-silenced deity stirs beneath the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs, summons you to restore the flock and reclaim what time has erased. But as you breathe life into what long passed, a creeping Rot awakens, spreading corruption through the sacred mountain the lambs once called homeâ¦<br/>
<br/>
Not all who tread this peak come seeking redemption. Upon the frozen summit, a wolf prowls â his pack hungers for war with the covetous Gods. Deep within the hidden caverns, a shadowy figure waits, blade honed and patience fraying. Restless spirits drift along the ridges, each bound by former sins. The past was buried for good reason â will you unearth it, or will it consume you?<br/>
<br/>
That which was sacred now rots, and nothing is as it seems. Last of the lambs, Woolhavenâs fate rests in your hooves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return the lost souls of Woolhaven to their spiritual home and learn the long-forgotten history of lambkind. Rebuild the fallen town to its former glory and reclaim the mountain to restore the depleted power of Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs. But beware: there is always a price to be paid.</li>
<li>Endure harsh weather, including blizzards and freezing temperatures, that threaten your Cultâs survival. Build new structures to keep your loyal followers warm and protect them from frostbite and famine.</li>
<li>Unlock ranching at your Cult base and breed rare animals that provide wool, warmth, and when times are particularly desperate, precious meat. Tame, ride, and let your followers take care of these majestic creatures.</li>
<li>Venture into a new realm battered by bitter storms, crawling with creatures corrupted with the Rot lurking beneath the snow. Battle through two vast new dungeons, where the echoes of the past refuse to rest.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Funcom have patched Dune: Awakening quite a few times since release, the experience on Steam Deck is now good enough that it's been Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best MMOs released in a long time, I've been having a seriously good time with it, although it's a huge time sink. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial release worked great on Desktop Linux</a> but was just a little rough on Steam Deck. Seems now though Valve felt the issues it had that kept it to a Playable rating have improved enough.</p>
<p>As of August 18th, it's Steam Deck Verified with Proton 9.0-4. The developers also put up an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1172710/announcements/detail/515218419125060464" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for the change on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings Sleepers, </p>
<p>Weâre excited to announce that Dune: Awakening is now fully Steam Deck verified! </p>
<p>Until now, it has been in the Playable category, but after some tweaks, it now meets all of Valveâs requirements to be a smooth experience on the Deck: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All functionality is accessible when using the default controller configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game shows Steam Deck controller icons </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-game interface text is legible on Steam Deck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This gameâs default graphics configuration performs well on Steam Deck </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So put some Dune in your Deck and bring a little spice wherever you go. </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your support as the team continues to work on improvements. Any issues you report using the in-game tool and feedback you leave across all our channels is massively appreciated! We look forward to sharing more details about all the new content we have in store for Dune: Awakening. </p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong &#39;special announcement&#39; coming August 21</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A special announcement from Team Cherry has been revealed for Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>They've put up a video on YouTube that will premier at 2:30pm UTC / 3:30pm BST on August 21st. We don't know exactly what it will be for though, so speculation across social media is already going wild about it. This could just be a fresh proper gameplay trailer, a release date announcement or perhaps they might even surprise us all with a direct release along with the video (we can dream right?).</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or directly below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I continue to be amazed by just how wild the wait is for Hollow Knight: Silksong. There's not many times I've seen this kind of hype for a game in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/happy-birthday-gamingonlinux-16-years-today/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16 years</a> doing this. The pressure that Team Cherry are feeling must be unimaginable. Will it live up to expectations? </p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 x Halo: ODST crossover arrives on August 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay fine, I'll load HELLDIVERS 2 up again. I definitely don't want to miss the new HELLDIVERS 2 x HALO: ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>
<p>It arrives on August 26th bringing with it armour and weapons from the Halo series. Since it's a Warbond, it does need an extra purchase using in-game currency. But, to the credit of Arrowhead Game Studios, they have one of the best battle pass styled systems in any game I've ever played. You can buy up any Warbond, and then progress through them at your own pace as they don't vanish.</p>
<p>Here's what's in it:</p>

      <title>Valve continue building up their new game Deadlock with a big update with six new heroes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve developers are still working on their upcoming game Deadlock, a third-person MOBA and the latest update is a pretty big one.</p>
<p>There's still no word on a release date, likely as they had to announce it earlier than they wanted to due to all the repeated leaks but work is ongoing on it regularly. You also still need to be invited by someone else with access. Despite all that, it has been seeing over 10,000 concurrent players regularly. </p>
<p>This new update adds in six new heroes, although Valve are doing a staggered release of each with a new one unlocking each day over the week.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3109303521755607306gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A big new addition is also The Hideout. Giving you a private area to mess about in while you're waiting on a match. You can invite friends to yours or join others, and Valve said it will provide "future opportunities for personalization, achievements, and events".</p>
<p>This Hideout gives you access to various game functions along with a practice range to test movement and abilities without needing to load into the Sandbox.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3622847471755607911gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3622847471755607911gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396936861755607921gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9396936861755607921gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also updated the game map with "various visual improvements and lighting changes" and promises "a lot more map improvements planned in upcoming updates". </p>

      <title>Steampunk auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla gets a big free content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a really good auto-shooter taking elements from survivor-like bullet hells and it just had a big free content expansion. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Like other games inspired by the mechanics from Vampire Survivors, you pick a character (in this case, a ship) and go through waves of enemies while you keep upgrading. Airships: Lost Flotilla is one of the more unique in the list though with the path progression system where you pick different nodes, each a different location to fight through with unique bonuses to acquire.</p>
<p>The latest update adds in six new airships to pilot, five new enemy factions with their own unique set of enemies to shoot down, lots of new weapons and new captains to pick to mixup your play-through. Check out the update trailer:</p>

      <title>Webcam-based head &amp; eye tracking app for gaming, LookPilot gets improved Linux compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LookPilot continues being one of the most promising (and cheapest) ways to get 6DoF head &amp; eye tracking for gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>I covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/webcam-based-6dof-head-eye-tracking-app-lookpilot-released-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux last week</a> when it released, since it has some really fun features to change the way you game. Since it's webcam-based, it's easy to get it up and running too without expensive dedicated hardware and no annoying driver issues.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hs-8CzalGIk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62471e9f7661bab3efc09bc07cf003c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hs-8CzalGIk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Across the weekend the developer released the "Linux Compatibility Update" with lots of improvements for the detection systems on Linux, and making the app easier to run:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Protocol changes</h2>
<h3>Auto protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>No manual bash script launch required anymore.</li>
<li>Faster game discovery.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility across games.</li>
<li>Replaced <strong>Game Process</strong> setting with <strong>Wine Prefix</strong> setting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Freetrack protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved compatibility across games.</li>
<li>Renamed <strong>freetrack (Proton)</strong> â <strong>freetrack (Wine)</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Other</strong> launcher type, changed <strong>Tool Path</strong> setting â <strong>Wine Executable</strong> setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: visualization cube not showing for some users.</li>
<li>Fixed: auto protocol JSON decode error.</li>
<li>Fixed: app crash on resize on Linux.</li>
<li>Bug reports now include more comprehensive logs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said the demo version has been extended to 14 days to give you more time to test it and report any issues.</p>
<p>Wonderful to see apps like this available for Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Puzzle colony builder AUTARKIS looks great with a demo up and releases September 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AUTARKIS is an upcoming puzzle colony builder from developer rockingprojects. It's all about building mini colonies, and protecting them from catastrophes.</p>
<p>Love the whole setup and style on this one, looks like a really fun idea to play through. You can try it yourself too, as ahead of the September 1st release there is a demo available on the Steam page. The idea here is that you're searching for lost parts of your spaceship, the AUTARKIS. Building across multiple island-style settlements at the same time with portals to supply between them, it has some clever ideas but there's plenty of danger too.</p>
<p></p>

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tactical Colony Layout - When your settlers land on a planet, they will find a harsh environment. Each building depends on its neighbours. Think carefully about the most efficient way to build your colony.</li>
<li>Running Multiple Colonies at the Same Time - Advanced portal technology allows you to manage multiple colonies at once. Explore new sectors of a planet to find lost ship parts. However, sometimes it might be necessary to abandon one of your settlements.</li>
<li>Surviving Against All Odds - Life on an alien planet is unforgiving. Your colony may face meteor showers, toxic clouds, floods or even the destruction of an entire sector. At worst, you will have to launch a second settlement expedition. Failure is part of the game.</li>
<li>Adapting to Varied Environments - You will establish colonies on various planets. Each with different conditions. Build in an Earth-like environment, among giant mushrooms or on windy desert plains.</li>
<li>The Journey Back to AUTARKIS - The ultimate goal of every settlement expedition is to return to the mothership AUTARKIS. Ideally with the ship components you are looking for, but of course the lives of your settlers are your first priority.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GeForce NOW gets Blackwell GPUs, install to play games, a Steam Deck upgrade and Discord integration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA GeForce NOW is set for some huge upgrades with GeForce RTX 5080-powered servers, a new way to play games and the Steam Deck gets a boost too.</p>
<p>This will add in DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which they said will allow up to 5K streaming at 120FPS. Plus support for up to 360FPS at 1080p with NVIDIA Reflex. There's also a new "Cinematic-Quality Streaming (CQS) mode" that uses a "host of technological advancements to significantly improve image quality".</p>
<p>More about the CQS mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cinematic-Quality Streaming</strong><br/>
Members will experience a noticeable leap in graphics fidelity with CQS for the highest-quality visual experiences in the cloud. CQS features a suite of technologies powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, delivering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stunning Color Accuracy:</strong> Support for the YUV color model with 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit high dynamic range enables true-to-life visuals with richer colors, sharper edges and deeper contrast â ideal for games with detailed text and intricate backgrounds, such as with lush foliage and rich greenery.</li>
<li><strong>Supersmooth Streaming:</strong> Advanced AV1 encoders offer seamless adaptation to changing network speeds, ensuring uninterrupted play.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal-Clear Graphics: </strong>New heads-up display sharpness and AI-powered video filters, available on select games, keep on-screen text crisp and action scenes free from blur or noise, even during fast-paced games.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Every Screen:</strong> New automatic detection of a laptopâs display resolution delivers the highest possible streaming quality â especially on laptops with high dots per inch, or DPI.</li>
<li><strong>Blazing-Fast Bitrates: </strong>With up to 100 Mbps streaming, every detail stays sharp, so gamers can tap into todayâs fastest home internet connections.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam Deck, NVIDIA said they're going to be bumped up the FPS from 60 to 90 with the release of the Blackwell servers when using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam Deck app</a>.</p>
<p>They also announced Install-to-Play games, which allows you to install games that have opted into supporting NVIDIA GeForce NOW but don't yet have a dedicated slot for them like other games, which will give you around double the games you can use with GeForce NOW. Ultimate and Performance members get 100GB of "single-session cloud storage" for this (which is wiped when you leave) but there's also an option for persistent storage of "200GB for $2.99 per month, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99 per month".</p>
<p>NVIDIA are also teaming up with Discord and Epic Games, to instantly load up games on Discord with nothing extra needed powered by GeForce NOW. Fortnite being the first game that will be added in this limited-time trial that will be shown behind closed doors at Gamescom. Discord had their own <a href="https://discord.com/blog/transforming-game-discovery-with-instant-play-experiences-on-discord" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on this too.</p>

      <title>Nintendo 64 emulator gopher64 recently added save state slots and netplay cloud servers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If Nintendo 64 is your thing, keep an eye on the gopher64 emulator which is steadily adding in more features and has Linux support.</p>
<p>This is from the same main developer that worked on <a href="https://github.com/simple64/simple64" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">simple64</a>, which was a originally started as a fork of Mupen64Plus. The simple64 project is no longer developed and the GitHub page archived, with the developer moving onto creating and maintaining gopher64.</p>
<p>Writing in the GitHub Discussions to give a little more detail on it the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not based on GLideN64 at all. For graphics (RDP) it uses parallel-rdp (<a href="https://github.com/Themaister/parallel-rdp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Themaister/parallel-rdp</a>). I am not the author of parallel-rdp, but it is used in a number of N64 emulators for low-level RDP emulation.</p>
<p>For the rest, it is a combination of original research, mupen64plus, and ares. For example, the CPU interpreter is original, it is not based on mupen64plus or ares. The cache emulation also works differently from both of those emulators. The RSP opcodes are mostly taken from ares, but not the interaction between the RSP/CPU.</p>
<p>Basically, for each component, I decided whether mupen64plus or ares had a really good implementation that I couldn't really improve on. If not, I wrote something new. Sometimes it is mostly taken from another emulator, but with some of my own improvements, etc... whatever worked best for each component of the emulator.</p>
<p>It also contains some features that aren't found in mupen64plus or ares, for example, SummerCart64/SD card emulation, CPU overclocking, Japanese VRU support, etc..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks two new releases went up with these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Save state slots are supported. Press Alt+0-9 to change which save state you are saving/loading from.</li>
<li>On-screen messages (no more robotic Scottish voice). These will let you know when you change your controller pak, save or load a state, when cheats are enabled, etc..</li>
<li>Small improvements to the controller selection dropdowns.</li>
<li>Update to latest versions of Rust and SDL.</li>
<li>Use nearest filtering for final image rendering (results in a sharper image).</li>
<li><strong>On-demand netplay cloud servers</strong>. Previously, there were 3 always-running netplay servers (US West, US East, and Europe). Now, you can create a netplay server across many different regions (as of now, there are 12 regions, please let me know if you would like one that isn't there today).
	<ul>
<li>This works by creating the server on demand when you request it. This means that when you create a server, it will take about 20-30 seconds for it to complete. This is the time it takes to provision the server.</li>
<li>There is also now a unified session browser. All games from across all regions are shown in the "Join Session" window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the GPL license.</p>

      <title>Valve announce language-specific user review scores for Steam games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have carefully tweaked the user review system for Steam games, to now include language-specific user review scores.</p>
<p>This new system is on by default for all Steam users, however Valve said they realise changes will bring scrutiny and so there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/preferences/#review_score_preferences" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated setting</a> to disable it. If you do disable it, your Steam account will go back to seeing the overall review score from <em>all</em> languages posting Steam reviews.</p>
<p>Why have they done this? As Valve explained, they've grown a lot into having a massive global presence from users from all difference regions. Some games may have translation issues, specific cultural references and so on. Valve feel this language-based review score will help to capture these issues and that "Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distil the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups".</p>
<p>Keeping it all rather transparent, there's a whole new language breakdown section for Steam reviews you can click to open. At the top of the reviews section is this now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3636359071755538170gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And when you open the language breakdown you'll get to see the overall score as well:</p>

      <title>Last Epoch Season 3 will work better on Steam Deck and there&#39;s lots new coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of an ARPG to play on Steam Deck / SteamOS or other handhelds, Last Epoch Season 3 could be the one for you. They've recently put up the full details of what's including, and there really is a lot coming that should hopefully be a big hit for Eleventh Hour Games.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck and other lower-end systems, performance should be improved by quite a lot. They've detailed how with the Season 3 update that lands August 21st, they've worked in texture streaming across the whole game to provide "reduced memory usage and improved loading times" and now the game "uses at least 25% less vram with full texture resolution enabled". For Steam Deck, they said bumping it up to the Medium preset is now possible.</p>
<p>There's quite a few other optimisations they've made including optimising memory allocation, a new graphics setting to control the amounts of lights emitted by visual effects, a fix for hitching seen in the game, various lighting adjustments to improve performance and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Controller / gamepad input has seen a few improvements too like stopping accidental movement if a panel is open, controller navigation for the chat window and other controller UI adjustments.</p>
<p>Perhaps most exciting though is the big new Rift Beasts feature, which they said is a bit like the Nemesis mechanic from Shadow of Mordor, but different enough that they won't fall afoul of the ridiculous patent that Warner Bros. have on it. Essentially, you go through a series of encounters and fight off special beasties and their evolved descendants. Sounds pretty awesome. </p>
<p>Check out their new nearly 14 minute overview video below:</p>

      <title>Bioneers combines factory-building with organism simulation in a microworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bioneers will have you build up an organism on the micro-scale that mixes together elements of factory-building with organism simulation. Sounds like it could be a fun idea!</p>
<p>With you mixing various different types of cells including muscle, skin, fat, bones, nerves and more. You need to somehow connect them all up into creating functional living systems like digestive, respiratory and others. It's all about creation and then survival.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8yeWumI7Tao"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd7be609bf034fb64d5bb4b801aa1b10.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8yeWumI7Tao" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique gameplay</strong> that combines factory-building with organism simulation.<br/>
	Instead of buildings â cells, instead of conveyor belts â vessels, instead of enemies â viruses. The bigger your organism, the more powerful it becomes â but it also needs more resources to sustain itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animations inspired by real biology.</strong><br/>
	All cell and system movements are based on behavioral models from living organisms, creating a vibrant and believable microworld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A sandbox without limits.</strong><br/>
	Evolve as you wish: become an aggressive predator, a resilient symbiont, or a peaceful herbivore. Every choice affects your organism's evolutionary path.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Detailed customization.</strong><br/>
	Design your organism cell by cell, optimize systems, balance energy and resource consumption â you are the true creator of life.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Take command of a Cold War-era nuclear corvette in space with Deck &amp; Conn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Publisher MicroProse revealed Deck &amp; Conn, a single-player turn-based tactics game that places players in command of a Cold War-era nuclear corvette â in space.</p>
<p>It's being developed by a new studio, FUNTIME ELECTRICS, from Elissa Black the co-creator of Objects in Space, Swords of Freeport, and Metrocide. Deck &amp; Conn is a homage to classics like the 1971 Star Trek mainframe game. I do love my space games and chunky retro graphics and all things Star Trek, so this looks like it was made for me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f10tfiqdDdw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ff0a6f3cdedbc8e06fc46464765b14c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f10tfiqdDdw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Deck and Conn, players must lead their crew through a relentless forever-war among the stars. Every patrol brings tough choices: respond to distress calls, capture or destroy enemy ships, upgrade your systems, and manage scarce resources â all while shaping the legacy of your vessel and crew.</p>
<p>Whether facing the branching challenges of a dynamic campaign or honing skills in standalone tactical scenarios, Deck and Conn demands precision, adaptability, and decisive leadership.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command a Cold War-inspired nuclear space corvette in a retro-futuristic sci-fi universe.</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical combat with limited resources and intricate system management.</li>
<li>Dynamic campaign with war patrols, ship upgrades, and crew promotions.</li>
<li>Standalone combat scenarios to master tactical fundamentals.</li>
<li>Capture or destroy enemy vessels to gain rewards and shape your shipâs reputation.</li>
<li>Hand-crafted pixel art inspired by early â90s MicroProse classics.</li>
<li>Follow HQ orders and make high-stakes decisions in the endless war.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Jupiter Hell Classic is a &#39;demake of a remake of a roguelike unmake&#39; now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A demake of a remake of a roguelike unmake. It's okay to be confused, but Jupiter Hell Classic is a cool roguelike now in Early Access on Steam. <em>Disclosure: the developer provided GamingOnLinux a key.</em></p>
<p>To clear things up a bit though, because initially it warped my brain too, here's what it all means. It's based on DRL (DoomRL / Doom the Roguelike) which had to change it's name when lawyers got involved, but updated for their newer world created with Jupiter Hell. I'm a sucker for Jupiter Hell, as it has one of the absolute slickest turn-based movement systems ever.</p>
<p>It's not just the classic DRL updated for the Jupiter Hell universe though, they're adding in all sorts of upgrades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What to expect from Jupiter Hell Classic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Classic, unforgiving, top-down, grid-based roguelike gameplay.</li>
<li>Fast and fluid ranged based tactical combat.</li>
<li>Control via keyboard only, mouse + keyboard or gamepad.</li>
<li>Diagonal movement along movement based tactics.</li>
<li>Environmental destruction and interaction.</li>
<li>4 episodes, almost 200 items, 25+ enemies.</li>
<li>30+ crafting assemblies, 3 classes with 5 master traits each (subclasses).</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for all your nostalgia modding needs!</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the original, this does <em>not</em> have a Native Linux version. Speaking with the developer about it, they told me they had a "horrible experience with JH - where the libc situation broke our Linux build, and the Steam Deck build at the same time during a crucial time for JH" and that there "was there was no way to make Steam Deck run on Proton if there was a Linux version present, so we had to temporarily nuke it, and even that didn't help".</p>
<p>They're talking about Valve's Steam Deck verification system, which forcibly picks either the Native Linux build or the Windows build to run through Proton. Game developers don't get a choice in that. And so they didn't want to risk breakages due to Native Linux dependencies for this launch "especially that it flawlessly runs on Proton on the Deck".</p>

      <title>Become a chaotic vacuum in the physics-based action-adventure ACUVAC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I couldn't help but giggle a fair bit at the actual full name - ACUVAC: A Suck and Blow Adventure. Yes, that's really the name of this one. A bit unfortunate perhaps, or is my mind just terrible? It's not just me right?</p>
<p>Releasing soon on August 20th, there's also a demo available you can try right now. Here's a little more about it: "Take control of ACUVAC, a physics-driven canister vacuum with a mind of its own, in a destructive cleaning adventure. Use your hose to suck up, blow away, and manipulate the world around you in unexpected ways. Uncover, clean, and conquer every corner of this whimsical, robot-run world where anything goes, and chaos is all part of the fun!"</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL DO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CLEAN:</strong><br/>
	Vacuum trash, smash objects, and creatively interact with environments to complete objectives. Be the overachiever and super-clean the level, clearing out every object in sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>COLLECT:</strong><br/>
	Every unique object collected gets added to your own residence (Yes, <u>ACUVAC has their own house!</u>) Unlock new levels, arcade machines, and quirky cosmetics by earning medals and discovering hidden collectibles.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>CONQUER:</strong><br/>
	Master every challenge across varied sandbox levels. Take on unique tasks, unlock loads of special bonus levels, and compete in local-multiplayer modes. There's plenty of challenge and lots of different surprises to uncover!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Had to chuckle at the first reply to the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xenosage.bsky.social/post/3lwh6vrqdgk2k" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> as well, on how you're basically the Noo-Noo from Teletubbies. A classic British young kids TV show that was just â <em>weird</em>. As for the game, looks like some quality physics fun to be had with this one. I look forward to swinging my hose around.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TT Games pushed out a small update for LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes and managed to get it Steam Deck Verified in the process.</p>
<p>The actual <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/213330/announcements/detail/668340807104725171" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> doesn't go into any specifics on what's changed, it just notes the update "was to get this title Steam Deck verified" and that they've also enabled Cloud Saves now too. Great to see for this classic from 2012, a nice surprise to see them go back to tweak it. Goes to show how important the Steam Deck can be!</p>

      <title>THE FINALS should be fixed again with the latest Proton Experimental updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thankfully the Proton coders for Valve have managed to work quickly to get THE FINALS working on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/the-finals-broken-on-linux-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after it broke again</a>.</p>
<p>At least this time around it really wasn't the developer blocking anything, just a case Proton needing more tweaks to get a reasonably popular online shooter working again.</p>
<p>Writing on the official GitHub developer Paul Gofman <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-3192760744" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> that it "should hopefully be solved (or improved)" with Proton Experimental when using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bleeding-edge Beta</a> branch for it. Many reports on there and in THE FINALS' Discord show it does indeed fix the issue of the game kicking you out of matches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16138137191755524366gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat page was updated</a> to note this.</p>
<p>Likely the next proper update to Proton Experimental directly will have the fix without the need for a Beta. But that could be a few days, a week or longer.</p>

      <title>SlaveDriver Engine for the Sega Saturn classic shooter PowerSlave gets open sourced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Another win for game preservation and open source, with the release of the SlaveDriver Engine for Sega Saturn classic shooter PowerSlave. Originally released in 1996, there were also versions for PlayStation and MS-DOS. NightDive also made a modern port with PowerSlave Exhumed.</p>
<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/Lobotomy-Software/SlaveDriver-Engine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">now on GitHub</a> (and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/slavedriver-engine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>) under the GPL license. It's only the code, so you need to supply the data from the game to work with it.</p>
<p>Thanks to this anyone can now dive in and see how the game was made, expand it, port it to other systems and all sorts. Great news for the boomer shooter community and just gaming history.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5764355371755523785gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I wish more developers would do this for their classic games.</p>

      <title>LEGO Voyagers looks super sweet and arrives for co-op play on September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Light Brick Studio and Annapurna Interactive have announced that LEGO Voyagers will arrive for your next co-op session on September 15th. This looks like possibly the cutest LEGO game yet.</p>
<p>Now this I'm going to have to get, once me and my gaming partner get through our current session of It Takes Two. I really do love how this offers up both local and online co-op, and if you're playing at a distance online only one of you needs to own it with the Friend Pass system â excellent stuff.</p>
<p>Check out the short new trailer that arrived with the release date news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1J4Zq-A6FAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b90a59ccdbb5f102486dd9c4e4dc22e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the makers of LEGOÂ® Builder's Journey comes a new 2-player co-op adventure about friendship and play. When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friendâs Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rally Arcade Classics to expand with the Precision &amp; Chase update on September 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more rally games? Rally Arcade Classics looks like a good one and it's expanding with a free update on September 9th.</p>
<p>The game currently offers 44 iconic cars from different eras (70's, 80's and 90's) with a license-based progression system, so you have to train your driving skills to unlock different modes before driving legendary cars. This is not a standard arcade rally racer though, with more physics to provide something in between arcade and pro rally games. The Precision &amp; Chase will bring with it a new manual transmission mode, a revamped speedometer and a new online friends list with high scores.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CwYAgcSMzWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab275a77681f77cbc88a055eaf4d8b8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CwYAgcSMzWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>âWe devoted two hard years to create this game with a passionate team and one goal: to combine elements from different eras of racing games and keep an accessible experience for both veteran and new fans of the genreâ - Salvador Casamiquela, co-founder at NETK2GAMES.</p>
<p>It actually has a Native Linux version, but last I checked it was tweaked specifically for the Steam Deck, with no graphics options so it's all pre-set. You may want to use Proton to get access to everything properly. It's currently Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>You&#39;ve built cities with people, beavers, on top of giant creatures - and now you&#39;ll do it with Crows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowded was just announced as a new city-builder but it's all about nesting, since your people are Crows. Crowded is a crow city builder where you strategically design a nest-city to support and shelter your flock. Engineer, scavenge and explore your way to a self-sustaining society in the sky.</p>
<p>More about it: "Scavenge for delicious bugs and building materials, managing resources wisely so your feathered friends get what they need. Take flight and explore a landscape of lush forests and sprawling meadows, planting new trees to expand your territory. Strategically design your nest-city to support and shelter your adorable flock. Manipulate the wind itself to influence the environment and create a form of transportation. As you innovate, youâll also discover new technologies to lead your flock to greatness."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Nxb6ZeaFL9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8668a7ce3ffb0d80b26b971925516165.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Nxb6ZeaFL9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We wanted our game to feel truly avian. So, we came up with a design philosophy we call Featherpunk," said Alex Grenus, one of the devs at Nestwork Games. "It focuses on the anatomy of crows and their abilities. And as city builder fans, we know how enjoyable it is to watch our tiny people, animals, cars, etc go about their lives. In German (to no one's surprise) there is even a word for it 'Wuselfaktor'. We also want this in our game, so our buildings feature a lot of open space to watch the crows, and if you look closely, you can find some cute details."</p>
<p>Love the idea behind this and really can't think of another like it. Can't wait to see more.</p>

      <title>Docked is the latest big machinery simulation game from Saber Interactive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the teams that gave us SnowRunner, RoadCraft and more is Docked, a new big machinery sim about rebuilding a dock in the wake of a devastating hurricane.</p>
<p>Operate heavy machinery and vehicles, restore and upgrade the port's capabilities, and continually take on new jobs to expand the business. Another sim game fully of busy-work, but hey you get to mess with huge machines which is fun to some of us? I don't really get why though. What is it about big heavy machinery that makes us enjoy oddly tedious work?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SBguf_F3Yz4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8aa76f45a456e2735d62bef1eeebdf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SBguf_F3Yz4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You're the manager of Port Wake, and so you have to keep everything flowing to save the family business. This includes unloading huge cargo ships and establish various logistical chains and complete jobs to earn resources. No date is being given on when it might release so we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port Wake Calls</strong>: From ship to crane to truck and beyond, every job is a vital piece of the business. Manage operations and vehicles, take on important contracts, and make high-priority cargo runs to fulfill your commitments. When wear and tear drags your equipment down, execute repairs under strict deadlines to keep the port growing.</li>
<li><strong>Operate Powerful Machinery</strong>: Take command of a fleet of realistic machines, expertly engineered with the raw power and precise handling to fulfill your contracts, from colossal ship-to-shore cranes to sturdy, heavy-duty tractors and more. Tighten ropes, position materials, optimize weight distribution, navigate delicate cargo with little margin for error, and gain a firsthand understanding of what it means to work a dock.</li>
<li><strong>Earn, Invest &amp; Expand</strong>: Revitalize Port Wake one crane at a time. Every job you take earns cash to invest in new and more powerful machinery. Sign contracts to create new logistical chains and build up resources, purchase lots to store vehicles, upgrade fuel and power supplies, and conquer new milestones to save and expand the family business.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous sims worked well on Linux with Proton so I fully expect this to as well. If you on an AMD GPU that is, as it appears the most recent sim RoadCraft still has issues on NVIDIA.</p>
