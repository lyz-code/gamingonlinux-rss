<p>If those interest you then <a href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/y2GbLb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Humble Bundle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Humble have this month <em>closed</em> their built-in partner program and moved over to the <em>much</em> less generous third-party service called Impact. So our links have changed, and we get <em>far</em> less now too. Remember that <a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a> is the best way to support GamingOnLinux (and now more than ever!).</p>
<p>Additionally, Humble seem to now be including Deck Verified status and info pulled from ProtonDB on the bundle. Although they're conflating ProtonDB status with how a game will run on Steam Deck, like for The Last Stand: Aftermath they say underneath it has "ProtonDB Platinum Deck Support" despite Valve listing it as Unsupported (since ProtonDB covers desktop Linux too). Nice to see they're trying though.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for SteamVR, Game Recording and Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Steam Client Beta release is live for October 4th that includes a bunch of quick bug fixes for desktop and Steam Deck. Since it's a normal Client (the Steam App) Beta update, it's the same for Steam Deck and desktop.</p>
<p>Here's all the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659627343423606990?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam not being able to connect to SteamVR with error "SteamVR Failed to initialize: VR API not loaded (101)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from October 2nd's beta client which was causing some recordings to incorrectly fall back to using the CPU to encode video while playing a game, resulting in an increase in CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing exporting a clip to file, clipboard or chat to fail or sometimes crash.</li>
<li>Fixes some cases where the clip export dialog did not appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from the October 2nd Beta Update which caused per-controller preferences to not get loaded in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing some games to be repeatedly restarted after launching.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We're probably not far off having the Game Recording feature roll out to the stable client now. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-families-has-officially-launched-with-a-big-steam-client-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Families was officially launched in September</a>, this is the next big one coming.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a particular bug lately you want to see solved?</p>

      <title>JRPG-inspired adventure Flowstone Saga with a puzzle-battle system is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Impact Gameworks who made the excellent Tangledeep, their next game Flowstone Saga is officially out now with Linux support. <em>Note: my key was provided by NOVY UNLIMITED PR.</em></p>
<p>Given how much I enjoyed Tangledeep, I was keen to see what Impact Gameworks had up their sleeve next. It started off life as Puzzle Explorers: A Tangledeep Story which had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/07/puzzle-explorers-a-tangledeep-story-announced-and-now-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed crowdfunding campaign</a>, then it came back <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/flowstone-saga-is-an-upcoming-jrpg-inspired-adventure-from-the-dev-of-tangledeep/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of a year later</a> renamed to Flowstone Saga and it was a success this time around. Nice to see that when you have a good idea, sometimes you just need a little more time to get everything right.</p>
<p>Fusing together the basic idea of Tetris and a JRPG-styled adventure, with an intriguing story and some nice pixel art Flowstone Saga really hits a lot of the right notes. It pulls you in right from the start, even the first 5 minutes has you battling away as it teaches you the basics of the falling-blocks battle system and you just want <em>more</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The battle system basics are: drop the blocks to get a full horizontal line, which then gets destroyed and you'll attack the enemy. You start off with basic shapes, with more types of shapes to unlock as you go. It throws in lots extras as well with different types of special blocks you can line up and destroy for more damage, that make it feel just that bit more frantic.</p>
<p>Like a true classic RPG, you can fight multiple people in one battle, and switch targets any time while dropping blocks. You will need to do this at times too, as enemies can charge up special attacks, so this again adds to the additional heart-pounding moments when you really need those damn blocks to line up nicely. On top of that, enemies can throw stuff onto the board you need to clear, as they have harmful effects and become a nuisance. The design of it is mechanically just <em>great</em>. I'm not even particularly a Tetris fan at all, but here it fits in so perfectly that it's just plain fun.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P1ZIUS2DzEc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66c6968680fd0c66934fb896992aee9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P1ZIUS2DzEc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's even more to it, since it's an RPG, you have a level system. Here, you can earn special perks which can directly affect the block-dropping board. You could select to have some blocks pre-filled for example, with more filled at higher levels or put your unlocks into power perks when you hit enemies harder. There's multiple ways to play.</p>
<p>As you explore there's various places that need re-building, and here you do little puzzles instead of battles with the falling blocks. They're optional, but a nice way to help towards upgrades and just a fun little break from the rest of the game. Just a nice little extra added in for explorers and completionists.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to the story, it's thoroughly intriguing too and will keep you guessing for a while. You do learn early on <em>how</em> you do the block-dropping, and <em>where</em> the power specifically for you comes from but it's still quite mysterious on where it originallyy came from to keep you wanting to progress further and explore more of the carefully designed world. Nice bit of town-building outside all the battling too, giving you more of a sense of purpose. And, in true retro-RPG fashion, you can run into everyone's house and open their chest for some extras - has no one ever heard of a lock?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous pixel art with painstakingly handcrafted areas sprawling across multiple biomes.</li>
<li>An epic story grand in scope, but with plenty of heart and charm.</li>
<li>Designed with accessibility in mind – including multiple difficulty options and a turn-based “Hold” mode.</li>
<li>Improve, expand, and decorate the hub town of New Riverstone – helping its citizens and making it your own.</li>
<li>Mini-games with unique and quirky ways to play … and profit!</li>
<li>In co-op assist mode, join the fight with a friend in battle.</li>
<li>Lots of ways to create unique battle strategies and express yourself: equipment customization, perk trees, job system, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One nice touch is that before you even get to the main menu, you're given screen display settings so you can get it how you want it first. More games should do that.</p>
<p>There were a few issues with it at release across Linux / Steam Deck, but the developer has solved them before publishing this so you're good to go with the Native Linux version. Works really nicely.</p>
<p>If you long for the days of sweet-looking 16-bit styled JRPGs, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one. Everything from the art style, to the design of the music and sound effects really reminded me of the golden age of such games years ago. The battle mechanic really adds to the experience too. Absolutely worth grabbing without a second thought needed. Flowstone Saga made me, <em>surprisingly</em>, finally truly appreciate dropping-blocks.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372000/Flowstone_Saga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. And at some point on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/flowstone_saga" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a wonderful reinvention of what Pinball can be</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a few attempts to update Pinball into something new, and Pinball Spire is the latest that's out now. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. <em>Note: my key was sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>It's being called a pinballvania, because it takes some ideas from metroidvanias to provide a rather different experience for pinball fans and turns it into much more of an adventure. Developed by Apparition Games, a tiny indie game studio in Canada. What you get here is a rather unique blend of pinball, platforming and puzzles to make something quirky and different to spend your time with.</p>

<em>Pictured - Pinball Spire on Linux</em></p>
<p>What makes it quite different is that each main level in the game acts as a self-contained puzzle for you to solve, with the power of pinball. I'll be honest, pinball is a game I never really got. Like many others though, I did play plenty of Space Cadet in the early Windows days but other than that it never really appealed to me. However, Pinball Spire thankfully understands me and shows me there's another way to do it, one that's just far more exciting and mysterious.</p>
<p>Here you go into each new room not really knowing what to expect from it, and there's quite a lot of surprising variety in how you'll be dealing with each section. Thankfully, you've got a special scouter that you can hit a button to pause the movement at any time to look around and hover over objects to learn more, and hopefully get an idea on how to beat the room.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o4eVLrlq634"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de5a19e810f264c9cc632e385d6cc6e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o4eVLrlq634" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's definitely a little frustration that can be found though. Some parts of it seemed to take me forever, because I just couldn't hit a very specific spot. Other times you're left just waiting for the ball to drop, which can take a while in some cases. Basically, it has all the annoying bits of Pinball too, as well as all the exciting new additions to make it (to me) actually worth a go.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you're not just any old pinball, you have special abilities! Like being able to slow down time to line up a perfect shot (still not easy), but it gives you an actual shot line when you use the slow ability if the ball is over a flipper so you know exactly where it will fire. Seriously though, there's a few times I got worried I was smashing the keys on my keyboard a little <em>too</em> hard when desperately wanting to make a shot. Using these abilities takes up mana too, so you can't just use them all the time, which adds to the challenge of it all.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to the world of Pinballvania! A fusion of arcade pinball mechanics with platforming, puzzles, and exploration—drawing inspiration from retro action-adventure games</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Fun accessories to collect and equip to customize Pip’s appearance!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the launch of Pinball Spire, solo developer Tom Voros said: "I hope players enjoy the atmospheric art and music as they journey through the Pinball Spire in this unconventional take on pinball action!".</p>
<p>It's a really unique experience not to be missed. Fantastic design and great audio to go with it make it a really fun game overall.</p>

      <title>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) gets a first official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) from Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider version 1.1.1 is out now as the first official release to help improve Linux desktop and Steam Deck gaming.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: despite the name, it's not a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run outside of Steam.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First official release of UMU launcher!</p>
<ul>
<li>Should work inside both flatpak and snap</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have official builds for flatpak or snap yet, but instructions are provided on building and using for both:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak</a><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does it actually mean? It means that any app can run games using Proton just like they would from inside Steam so you can get a good experience with Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck from Epic Games, GOG, Amazon and various other stores via apps like Heroic, Lutris and others (when they add in full support for UMU).</p>
<p>This is all part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, and so all apps will end up using the same online database of game-specific fixes that some games need to run properly via protonfixes. In short: better compatibility overall for gaming — eventually.</p>

      <title>6 years after Kickstarter, Orphan Age dev Studio Black Flag shuts without a release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game development is a complicated beast, a constant challenge to get funding and for Studio Black Flag who were building the promising looking Orphan Age it's all over. A game I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/dystopian-life-sim-orphan-age-should-be-on-linux-currently-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2018</a> with their Kickstarter, when the developer was confident on it having Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/767660/view/4679893541742798755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer put it very bluntly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dropping the nautical jargon for clarity, the last few months we’ve been going through bankruptcy procedures in France. This started when communication broke down between us and our publisher, leading to payments not continuing. Alas, with our publisher not continuing funding and no other sources of continued funding to finalize the game, the French government has elected to shut down the studio effective immediately. (Like at the end of the work day today we cannot legally continue working.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the date, they shut as of October 2nd.</p>
<p>To make matters worse when going through the Kickstarter they originally stressed how they "tried to work with publishers, but we never found a compromise that respected Orphan Age's DNA". Clearly they found one, but this is where it gets messier. In the FAQ at the bottom of the announcement it seems their publishing agreement handed over all of the rights of the game noting "I’m not able to get into the specifics of our contract with our publisher, but we simply do not have ownership over Orphan Age in a way that would allow us to shop it to another publisher.".</p>
<p>It might not be the complete end for the game since the publisher <em>could</em> continue it but it's now entirely out of the hands of Studio Black Flag.</p>
<p>Brutal, but a reminder that there's a lot of <em>bad</em> publisher contracts out there, where like this you hand over all your rights just to get the money. The developer has not named the publisher involved.</p>
<p>It's <em>also</em> a reminder that a lot of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding campaigns aren't nearly enough for a developer to fund a full game. Which is why a lot of them also end up with a publisher.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud gets a tutorial Beta and the price goes up soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud is easily (and I keep saying this) one of the best roguelikes ever made, and with the latest Beta it's a lot easier to get into. You might also want to buy it soon before the price rises.</p>
<p>They're making the final preparations for the 1.0 release to leave Early Access later this year and on October 29th the price will be jumping up to $29.99 USD (it's currently $19.99). So now really is a good time to buy it, especially with the latest Beta release.</p>
<p>Writing in an update on Steam they said: "We just released the Caves of Qud tutorial on our beta branch. It’s designed to teach the very basics of Caves of Qud and ends with your character arriving in Joppa, just like in a standard game. If you’re already a seasoned Qud player, you’ll likely be familiar with most of what gets taught (though there may be some useful nuggets for you); if you have a friend who’s been itching to try the game, this is a great opportunity to get them going!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2c6burNvtsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd58887074390f4c94399bd41f6b179.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2c6burNvtsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tutorial Beta is opt-in on Steam and a separate download on itch.io. Unclear if the Beta is on GOG.</p>
<p>The tutorial along with the last segment of the main story will come into the main branch when 1.0 releases. Which there's no date for just yet. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.17 Beta released with another quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bigger Steam Beta Client recently</a> that had some nice improvements for Game Recording, and various Linux fixes along with another SteamOS Beta - we have yet another tiny SteamOS update.</p>
<p>Valve are really pushing towards the stable release of SteamOS 3.6 for Steam Deck now!</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.6.17 "End of the End of the Line" Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4674264042203547171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wireless</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem where Steam Deck would be unable to connect to certain Wi-Fi 7 access points</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the Beta naming, Valve were likely hoping the <em>previous</em> Beta was the final one. Hopefully this one then. Who knows, maybe they'll treat us to SteamOS 3.6 stable later today, since Valve do have a habit of releasing things on Friday.</p>
<p>To access the current Beta you need to be in the Beta or Preview channel via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII gets Windows system requirements with Linux and macOS details later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games and 2K have released the system requirements for Sid Meier's Civilization VII on Windows, but the Linux and macOS requirements will be coming later.</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention, Sid Meier's Civilization VII coming to Linux officially shouldn't be news since I've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered it</a> now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-february-11-2025-gameplay-reveal-trailer-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple times</a>. But it's a nice reminder for people who missed that.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed</a> off the requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What's this? Only 20GB? You mean big new games don't have to be 100s of GBs? I am shocked.</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841885325528043648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> Firaxis additionally said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also releasing Civilization VII for MacOS and Linux / SteamOS. However, we don't have specs to share for those platforms at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did email them previously to try and find out who is doing the Linux version, but they did not reply. Usually it's Aspyr Media, but they're not listed anywhere this time around so it might be done directly by Firaxis.</p>
<p>The Windows version will have Denuvo Anti-tamper, which doesn't actually have Linux support, so it's likely again the Linux version will not have Denuvo. Additionally, there's no launcher this time around but the game does require a 2K Account for online interactions (but not for offline play).</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV to get an Expansion Pass, plus Gotterdammerung DLC releases November 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that Hearts of Iron IV is getting a big new expansion in Götterdämmerung on November 14th, and they're bringing the whole Expansion Pass idea from other games to Hearts of Iron IV as well.</p>
<p>For the new Expansion Pass you get a 20% overall discount versus buying individually and the first pass will give you all of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant unlock of three new 3d tank models and a music track.</li>
<li>The Götterdämmerung expansion (Nov 14th 2024).</li>
<li>The Graveyard of Empires country pack (Q1 2025).</li>
<li>Prototype Vehicles unit pack (Q3 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for Götterdämmerung itself it's very much focused on Germany, which Paradox said is "something many of you have been clamouring for for many years". Sounds like a great addition to the game with a super-weapons feature and so this expansion is also giving you some new special tools. As Paradox developer said:</p>

<p>War drives all sorts of technological innovation in an attempt to out-do opponents and although many projects ultimately never saw the battlefield, Götterdämmerung aims to tie together existing research systems with a new experimental research mechanic that allows for both historical and less historical but plausible super-projects to be pursued. The research process will become an important part of gameplay, with scientists, map-located experimental facilities, and supporting infrastructure all combining to produce a wide variety of outcomes that can augment your forces or change the very nature of the war you are fighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Based on regular player numbers, this seems to be the currently most popular grand strategy game from Paradox.</p>

      <title>Monty Pythonesque humour fused with Renaissance art comes in Death of the Reprobate on November 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer Joe Richardson is bringing on another brilliantly funny fusion of Monty Pythonesque humour with artwork styled like moving Renaissance paintings in Death of the Reprobate. This is their third game in this style following on from Four Last Things in 2017 and The Procession to Calvary from 2020.</p>
<p>It's a standalone game, technically, so you don't need to have played or know anything from the previous games but it does continue the overall story of Immortal John.</p>
<p>More about it: "In stark defiance of his name, Immortal John is dying. His heir, 'Malcolm the Shit', graciously takes a break from ordering cruel and unusual executions to visit the dying man and seek his inheritance - I mean, fulfill his final wishes. Unfortunately for Malcolm, the promised title and riches will only be awarded if he completes seven good deeds before sundown. Guided by the Lord God Almighty (quite literally - if you’re stuck, He’s the one holding a big arrow), the player must set forth into a surreal world of real Renaissance paintings and help a host of preposterous characters in order to earn Malcolm his inheritance."</p>
<p>Announced today it's going to release with Linux support on November 7th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3ql6wnJwT8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7876ae2529ab7acb293fc2ccfdf72ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3ql6wnJwT8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork – Renaissance, Rococo and even a hint of Romanticism, to be a little more precise. Hundreds of paintings, spanning hundreds of years, are all brought together into one consistent world.</li>
<li>Classical Music – Music by Eduardo Antonello. Period appropriate music that adapts as the story progresses, recorded using real medieval/renaissance instruments.</li>
<li>Standalone Story – Death of the Reprobate is set in the same world as Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary, and features some recurring characters/themes, but it can be played independently.</li>
<li>Highbrow Buffoonery – Lofty subject matter is treated with gleeful flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about it, the developer Joe Richardson said: "I burnt myself the fuck out six months ago but the game wasn't done so I kept going and now I feel genuinely unwell lol I HOPE YOU LIKE IT!"</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739900/Death_of_the_Reprobate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>More info on the Valve (Steam) collab with Arch Linux and potential future hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the big news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-steam-begin-a-direct-collaboration-with-arch-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve (Steam) began a collaboration with Arch Linux</a>, to help fund two very specific parts of the Linux distribution. Now, we have a bit more info on what it means.</p>
<p>After an interview recently from the A1RM4X YouTube channel with an Arch Linux developer, Antiz, they took to Reddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lpne5p0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explain</a> things a little bit further to help people understand what's happening. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, the way packages are currently built / managed still requires a few manual interventions from Package Maintainers (e.g. triggering the build itself and signing the built packages afterwards). As of now, supporting multiple architectures would mean multiplying those manual steps by the number of supported / targeted architectures. With the current number of packages compared to the current number of (volunteers) Package Maintainers maintaining them, Arch is not able to handle the extra amount of effort that it would imply.</p>
<p>A central build service and a central secure signing enclave (the two projects concerned by that Valve "sponsoring") would streamline the overall process by allowing automated build and signing for packages without requiring any manual steps / interventions from Package Maintainers anymore (and it will also allow to increase the security of the process as a side benefit). Only such a streamlined / automated workflow would allow us to start working on supporting multiple architectures without implying to multiply the current amount of required effort.</p>
<p>In other words, those projects are prerequisites to start working on multiple architectures support in a clean &amp; sane way, which is a end goal shared by both Arch and Valve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically, a lot of it is towards supporting multiple architectures. And with the news that Valve are seemingly working on supporting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some form of Arm and Android support</a> (likely for a future VR headset), this definitely makes sense. Especially when Valve already use Arch Linux for SteamOS on the Steam Deck, it seems increasingly likely that Valve will use an Arch Linux base for what comes next.</p>
<p>Antiz has also been replying to other comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lps1xud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, in one post noting that it is very much their "end goal" for Arch Linux to support multiple architectures.</p>
<p>Check out the full interview on the A1RM4X YouTube channel with the Arch Linux developer Antiz:</p>

      <title>XR glasses on Linux / Steam Deck get vastly better with the XR Gaming Plugin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Wayne Heaney has been working to make XR glasses on Linux / Steam Deck a much better experience, and their latest release of the XR Gaming Plugin sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Heaney has been working on the <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/XRLinuxDriver" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XR Linux Driver</a> for Linux devices (including the Steam Deck) to automatically recognize supported XR glasses, <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breezy Desktop</a> a collection of tools to enable virtual desktop environments for gaming and productivity (desktop Linux) and the Decky Loader <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XR Gaming Plugin</a> to bring easy controls <em>directly</em> in Steam Deck's Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>This includes support for popular XR glasses from VITURE, TCL/RayNeo, Rokid and XREAL.</p>
<p>As they said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fq0rt3/xr_on_steam_deck_just_got_way_better/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> the new 1.0 XR Gaming Plugin brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Display</strong> mode - "pin" your game so it doesn't follow your head movements. Enable <strong>Side-by-side</strong> so the display can be pulled in closer (like a real monitor) or moved further away to reduce eye strain or play games that support 3D side-by-side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VR-Lite</strong> mode - head tracking in first and third-person games creates a VR-like experience for non-VR games (doesn't require SteamVR, etc...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow</strong> mode - Resize and reposition the display, put it in the corner of your display or just make it smaller so it's easier to see the edges. Enable <strong>Smooth follow</strong> so the screen glides to follow you and smoothes out bumps and jerks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual display and smooth follow modes give you the ability to <strong>zoom-in</strong> for a more IMAX-like experience (this crops the display, but you can use head movements to look to the edges) or enable a <strong>curved display</strong> that wraps around you for easier viewing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've used the plugin before, the biggest improvement is that the Virtual Display and Follow effects apply across <strong>everything in Game Mode</strong>: Steam OS views like Home and Library, all games, streaming apps like Chiaki and Moonlight, even apps like Firefox</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it requires the latest SteamOS 3.6 Beta.</p>
<p>See their video talking about the update below:</p>

<p>Some of their future plans include native KDE support for Breezy Desktop, Multi-monitor support for Breezy Desktop for productivity on GNOME, Monado integration and more.</p>

      <title>DOOM ported to run almost entirely on AMD GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whatever will they do with DOOM next? A developer at AMD decided to port over classic DOOM to run almost entirely on the GPU. Why? In their own words "Because I can".</p>
<p>From the doomgpu <a href="https://github.com/jhuber6/doomgeneric/tree/master" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a port of DOOM that runs (almost) entirely on the GPU using the <a href="https://libc.llvm.org/gpu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LLVM C library for GPUs</a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doomgeneric</a> interface.</p>
<p>To try it you will need a WAD file (game data). If you don't own the game, shareware version is freely available (doom1.wad).</p>
<p>This implementation works on NVIDIA as well as AMDGPU. To use the NVIDIA implementation perform the same steps but with the <code class="inline-code">nvptx</code> loader and make target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6070146121727947637gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6070146121727947637gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We've seen DOOM run on basically everything, so why not just a GPU? According to the GitHub page it currently requires a Linux system, an AMDGPU with ROCm support, SDL2 libraries, a ROCm or ROCR-Runtime installation and an LLVM build off of the main branch (LLVM20 as of writing).</p>
<p>How they did it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code class="inline-code">clang</code> compiler can target GPUs directly. We emit a single kernel that calls the 'main' function. Functions that require the operating system are handled through the RPC interface. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLGc48GYHc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my LLVM talk</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This implementation defines the <code class="inline-code">amdgpu-loader</code> utility, which handles launching the <code class="inline-code">main</code> kernel, setting up the SDL2 window interface, and provides functions to get the input keys and write the output framebuffer. Okay, it's not <em>entirely</em> on the GPU, but all the logic and rendering runs on the GPU.</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 update The Armory released with weapon charms</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest major update to Counter-Strike 2 that brings with it more than 100 new items including weapon charms. These charms are quite popular in other shooters, so it's not a big surprise to see Valve add them in. Plus, it's yet another cosmetic item for Valve to basically print money with.</p>
<p>This brings with it a new battle pass system, which Valve call an Armory Pass. Although they work more a like a ticket, and you can have up to five of them active at a time. Each Armory Pass costs £12.79 so they're certainly not cheap and they each give a total of 40 credits. All the new stuff is gated behind this system too, so you have to buy a pass (or five) and then actually play to earn Armory Credits to then redeem for the items.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20818164661727946423gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20818164661727946423gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new weapon charms look quite nice, and you can place them anywhere on your weapons too.</p>
<p>In true Valve style, it's all random too. You can select a specific category of items to spend your credits, and then pay up to receive a random item from the collection. Obviously this is to get you to pay <em>and</em> play more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11104623031727946626gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11104623031727946626gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also made some changes to inventory items, placing a 7 day re-trade and re-market restriction on everything no matter how you got them. That includes the in-game store (including the Armory), Trade Offers and Steam Community Market.</p>
<p>There's also some network improvements, animation improvements and various bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets big Game Recording improvements, plus Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.16 Beta out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh Steam Client Beta for all platforms with some big Game Recording improvements, plus there's also another small Steam Deck SteamOS Beta update.</p>
<p>First up the Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.16 "End of the Line" Beta has this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4674264042200389436?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one note</a> "Fixed a system crash when hotplugging a second display in Desktop mode".</p>
<p>A Steam Client Beta was also released, with these <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4674263407967028563?snr=2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> specific to the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games stored on an external drive still showing as available when the drive is removed.</li>
<li>Make the enter action on the login password entry attempt to login rather than requiring navigation to the "submit" button.</li>
<li>Improve compatibility for native titles that have not been reviewed yet by launching them in the same runtime environment as reviewed titles.</li>
<li>Added a setting to record microphone input alongside gameplay audio.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the main Steam Client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659626709189608599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 126.0.6478.183</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for recording with the H.265 (HEVC) video codec when supported by the machine's GPU. This is enabled by default on Windows and should provide improved recording video quality over H.264 at the same file size. Coming soon to Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for recording up to 4k video resolution when using H.265 (HEVC).</li>
<li>Added a new "auto" quality setting that will set the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution. This will raise the bit rate when recording games running in 4k, to keep the recorded video sharp, and lower the resolution when running a game at 1080p to save disk space. This setting is on by default for all users.</li>
<li>Added support for recording ultrawide monitors up to 32:9 aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Added a setting to limit the width &amp; height of recorded video.</li>
<li>Exporting a recording (to file, clipboard or chat) will now use the machine's GPU to perform encoding and decoding when available.</li>
<li>Generating screenshots from recordings will now use the machine's GPU when available.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where exporting a recording could fail.</li>
<li>Added export settings dialog to allow custom file size or other settings when exporting a clip.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the media manager when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the app details page's screenshot section when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>In per-game settings, add the ability to record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit.</li>
<li>Integrated the list of games where recording is disabled into the per-game settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash occurring when querying community controller configurations in the configurator.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for AV1 video streaming on high end systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash in some games using D3D9.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This version of the Steam client will no longer run on Windows 7 or Windows 8. Users on these OS versions will automatically be opted out of the beta. See <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</li>
<li>Improved detection of other computers for streaming and peer downloading when using a secondary wireless interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This version of the Steam client will no longer run on macOS 10.13 or 10.14. Users on these OS versions will automatically be opted out of the beta. See <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/743F-2E0E-C9A5-C375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed some parts of the in-game overlay ignoring clicks when the Game Recording timeline is visible.</li>
<li>Fixed slow startup on systems where the reverse hostname lookup for the loopback interface is not localhost.</li>
<li>Detecting and passing commands to an already running Steam client is significantly faster.</li>
<li>Added a -disable-screensaver-inhibit command line option to prevent Steam from inhibiting the screen saver when activity is detected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully it won't take Valve too long to hook up H.265 (HEVC) on Linux, sounds great. Nice to see continued Linux improvements overall too!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update October 4th:</strong> the Steam Client Beta was updated and re-released with this fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>
This update was re-released October 3rd with the following additional change:
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression in beta that prevented game recording and remote play from using the GPU encoder.</li>
</ul>

      <title>From November 15, all Steam games sold in Germany will need an Age Rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/all-older-games-being-sold-in-germany-on-steam-now-require-a-content-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earlier in 2024</a>, Valve announced that games being sold in Germany were going to require an Age Rating to continue to be sold, and now there's a deadline.</p>
<p>An update was posted to Valve's official Steamworks <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey/germany" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentation</a> (thanks <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@SteamDB/113236564734679281" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>), that now makes it clear that game developers have a deadline of November 15th 2024 to ensure an Age Rating is provided. If one is missing, from that date the games simply won't be displayed to Steam customers in Germany.</p>
<p>Developers will need to "truthfully complete Steam's built-in content questionnaire and publish the results". Thankfully Valve has a built-in system for this, so it shouldn't take long for developers to do.</p>
<p>From Valve's FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q. When do I need to complete this questionnaire by?</strong><br/>
A. You can complete the questionnaire at any time. Games without a German age rating will be hidden from customers in Germany starting November 15, 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q. If I fill out the questionnaire, is my game guaranteed to remain available in Germany?</strong><br/>
A. No. There are certain kinds of content that are not allowed for sale to customers in Germany. If present in your game, this content must be disclosed in the content questionnaire. Please complete the questionnaire completely and truthfully. Steam will automatically generate an appropriate rating for your game in Germany. If the generated rating allows, your game will automatically become visible to customers in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q. What if my game has a USK rating?</strong><br/>
A. If your game has been issued an age rating by going through the rating process directly with USK, you may also enter that information within the store page editor for your game. This is rare. If you do not have an agreement directly with USK, do not enter a USK rating.</p>

      <title>China continues rising on the Steam Survey with Linux now at 1.87%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pretty much as expected, the Linux user share overall on Steam has dropped off a bit with the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for September 2024.</p>
<p>We almost always see the Linux user share drop, when Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam rises due to the popularity of Windows in China and just the massive amount of people there that cause the spikes to happen. Especially so with continued popularity of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall user share per operating system:</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx gets shut down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with yuzu</a>, many wondered if it would happen, and now it has. Nintendo has shut down the Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx.</p>
<p>Earlier today the <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page vanished into a 404 not found error, with some confusion amongst contributors. But it has now been confirmed on the official Discord and on social media that it's not an error. As stated in <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the post</a> the original creator was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement if they stopped working on it and removed everything related to Ryujinx.</p>
<p>It should be noted, this announcement comes from another contributor riperiperi, <em>not</em> the original Ryujinx creator gdkchan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953926441727817061gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of. While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.</p>
<p>These words are my own. I don't want to speak for anyone else here, so just remember that while reading.</p>
<p>Thank you to @everyone who has contributed code, documentation or issue reports to the project. Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special. I'm extending my own massive thanks to our moderation team, who have been here through some rough circumstances and always found ways to make light of it.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo has continued their crackdown on YouTube videos showing their games being emulated, with Retro Game Corps recently being hit as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explained</a> in a post. Even though it was for the Wii U, a console no longer supported by Nintendo.</p>

      <title>Epic Games reduce their cut for Unreal Engine games for same-day Epic Store launches </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games are once again trying to entice more game developers to not only ship same-day on the Epic Games Store, but to use Unreal Engine too.</p>
<p>Announced during Unreal Fest Seattle 2024 is the new "Launch Everywhere with Epic" program. A deal for game developers and publishers that use Unreal Engine, to get a reduced royalty cut from 5% to 3.5%. This reduced cut will apply to all platforms and all stores (including Steam and consoles), as long as they ship their games at least same-day on the Epic Games Store. This new royalty model will begin January 1st, 2025.</p>
<p>This is on top of previous exclusive deals like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/epic-games-launch-first-run-and-now-on-epic-with-100-revenue-for-devs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic First Run</a>, that can give developers 100% of the revenue for 6 months before going back to their standard 88%/12% split.</p>
<p>No doubt something that will entice more developers to get their games shipped on the Epic Store, and likely Unreal Engine too since the royalty fee is quite low. It's also another way for them to get more developers to release on their new mobile stores too, since developers also get 100% of net revenue if they use their own in-app payment solution (or 88% using Epic's).</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store still has no official Linux desktop or Steam Deck support, so you'll need community-built software like Heroic Games and Lutris to work with it.</p>

      <title>Devolver launch Big Fan Games a label for indie devs to work on licensed games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Devolver Digital have just announced the proper launch of Big Fan Games, a new label that will work with indie developers to work on licensed content to make games from their favorite movies, comics, TV shows, and cult heroes and more.</p>
<p>They've already done collaborations in the past like John Wick Hex and Reigns: Game of Thrones. Although some are thanks to Good Shepherd Entertainment, which Devolver acquired back in 2021.</p>
<p>From the press release they note their team including people that have experience "working with games and entertainment properties like Dune, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead, Blair Witch, The Power Rangers and more".</p>
<p>Years and years ago, licensed games were a huge thing, they were everywhere. Movie tie-ins were often a given, but over time that was lost. So, it will be interesting to see what Big Fan Games along with indie developers can keep cooking up. However, the press release does stress that their goal is not for marketing tie-ins but for "fun and inventive games that stand on their own".</p>
<p>There's no doubt an endless list of movies and TV shows that would be prime settings for standalone games.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/news/introducing-big-fan-games-a-new-publisher-dedicated-to-creative-adaptations-of-iconic-entertainment-brands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launch announcement</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Jump and climb through huge structures in the creepy and atmospheric Lorn&#39;s Lure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lorn's Lure is a thoroughly odd game. It's all about jumping and climbing your way through these huge structures, with a creepy and lonely atmosphere it's certainly a unique experience not found elsewhere. <em>Note: Key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I've followed this with great interest since the first early preview versions, intrigued by the idea of the game. With an intro that instantly makes you sit back and just take it all in, you know you're in for something different. Lost and alone for 100s of years, you assume the role of an Android trying to find their way out of this…place.</p>
<p>You've by now seen all the complaints across social media about yellow paint, and various other forms of in-your-face sign-posting in games to show you the exact places to climb right? Well, Lorn's Lure strips all that away and basically says "good luck finding your way". A challenge, since it's pretty easy to get a bit turned around, but the exploration and wonder you get from it is quite something. That said, there's a few hints like a waypoint marker you can toggle but it's not forced on you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vAa2JQM7GRM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4ff78a00c24a153f791266cda7b7de06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vAa2JQM7GRM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, you're not <em>entirely</em> alone. The intro gives you a first glimpse at some kind of owl, that looks like a visual glitch that entices you to go deeper into the world. The mystery surrounding the world and what happened to everyone was really causing an itch in my brain that needed to be scratched, I had to find out more and go deeper. The atmospheric sounds are wonderfully done too, and really demand you turn the volume up and put on some good headphones to fully take in the feeling of it, and once I realised that it truly lured me in.</p>
<p>You get a lot of hints as to what happened, most of it through environmental story-telling, which is how it rewards the exploration and not always just blindly jumping around to keep progressing. A game that will truly leave a lot of burning questions in your mind. You will find some lore too, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p>Speedrunners will probably like what it provides as much as those who like to explore and take their time, and I would genuinely love to see some attempt it in this one because the control system along with various in-game challenges make it worth watching as much as playing.</p>
<p>No parkour here though, this is not a run and jump sort of game. With the help of your tools, you can climb practically every vertical wall. It's very much your choice on how you approach the game, although some parts are more enclosed and linear than others, it does a good job at spacing it all out throughout the game. It is a tough one, but the game mechanics are simple enough to get to grips with.</p>
<p>While it's a thorough challenge, it's not in any way punishing. The restart system from your last jump off a ledge makes experimenting with your positioning and choices on how you tackle all the platforming and climbing a fun thing. That doesn't in any way make it easy though. You're still going to fall to your doom countless times.</p>
<p>Really interesting. Check it out.</p>

      <title>#DRIVE Rally is an impressive new racer that I can&#39;t wait to see more from</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new racing game? #DRIVE Rally from Pixel Perfect Dude is officially out now in Early Access. <em>Note: my key was provided by Evolve PR.</em></p>
<p>I've not actually played many rally styled games recently, so this has been a bit of a treat. And, it's nice to see another with proper Linux support too, especially when we see games like EA SPORTS WRC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being completely broken</a>. Not quite the same of course, but #DRIVE Rally is a worthy addition to your racing game library even this early on. I generally prefer the more arcade-styled racers to the serious stuff anyway, and this is actually a pretty great blend between serious driving but with a more arcade look and feel overall and it works well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wyXsRMdI5O0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/557589aad648f3942564231482b7e2ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wyXsRMdI5O0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The more I played of it, the more I kept thinking it reminded me of something. Then it hit me! I adored <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/art-of-rally-strips-down-the-furious-sport-into-a-serene-top-down-experience/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">art of rally</a>, and this basically feels like a new blend of it that's slightly more like a traditional arcade rally game. For anyone who has played art of rally, that really is the best description I can give because of how it feels. Here though, it's a fair bit more extensive and in-depth so if you want something a little more it's already a good choice and it's not even done yet with more to come.</p>
<p>Something I did quite appreciate is the cinematic camera, allowing you to remove the HUD to just get you to appreciate the view and the race a lot more. And gosh, I genuinely <em>love</em> the visual style Pixel Perfect Dude has gone for here. While other bigger developers continue to chase realism (which lets face it, gets boring - where the <em>style</em>?!), this feels like the perfect middle-ground on visuals.</p>
<p>One change I would like to see is the ability to move the co-driver announcements to the top of the screen, they feel a bit buried as subtitled at the bottom right now. Would feel more natural to have the navigator text at the top where your focus generally is. And if they could add direction icons instead of just text like other rally games that would be a big improvement too. Another change I would also really like to see is more camera options, as they're quite limited. It's either right up close behind the vehicle, or inside it, with nothing else. Once those two requests are done, I truly think it would be a whole lot more special. Simple things, but essential for me.</p>
<p>While it is a brilliant start for the game it does have one problem — it's <em>far</em> too easy. I came first in everything, and I am truly a horrifically bad driver. There needs to be some difficulty options where you can customize the challenge to actually make it more fun. The driving feels great with handling that is exactly what I would expect from it on an Xbox Controller, it looks great, sounds pretty good too but it's simply too easy.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over 400 km of Rally Tracks</strong>: Tackle diverse environments inspired by real-world rally locations. From sun-scorched deserts to icy mountain roads, every track offers a different challenge.</li>
<li><strong>36 Customizable Cars Across 3 Unique Classes</strong>: Fine-tune your car to match your racing style. Each class modifies your vehicle's base stats, pushing you to adapt your driving to extract every bit of performance out of your car.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Co-Drivers</strong>: Your co-drivers will react in real-time to your performance, guiding you to victory or throwing in some sharp-tongued criticism. <em>Constructive</em> criticism, of course!</li>
<li><strong>Championship Mode</strong>: Choose a constructor and conquer all their stages. Rise to the top of the leaderboards and unlock customizable vehicle parts on your way there.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Mode</strong>: Capture your favorite moments with a state-of-the-art photo mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currently the Early Access edition has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 unique rally locations with up to 48 stages each (24 normal and 24 reverse).</li>
<li>Championship mode with 4 fully voiced co-drivers to guide or taunt you.</li>
<li>12 cars with unique performance stats, each with 3 different classes, providing a total of 36 variations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's in Early Access it's not finished, with plenty more content planned in regular updates.</p>
<p>Definitely enjoyed my time with it so far and once my issues above are solved, it will be then a must-buy. For now, though, I still think it's good but it's a few steps away from being truly great. I'll be keeping tabs on this one, giving it more thoughts as it adds in more features because I truly like what I'm seeing.</p>
<p>Available to buy with Native Linux support on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2494780/DRIVE_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/drive_rally" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>. There's no Steam Deck rating for it yet but the developer explained it has been "fully optimized for the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>Silence of the Siren is a new HoMM-like from the dev of Project Hospital</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a genre change for Project Hospital developer Oxymoron Games, as they've just put their Heroes of Might and Magic-like game Silence of the Siren into Early Access. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>A very promising one if you like the blend of exploration and turn-based strategy, although this is in a fun sci-fi setting where you're fighting for control over a distant star system. You get to explore what's left of various planets, secure resources, upgrade your bases and hire big armies. From what I've seen and tried of it, if you enjoyed Heroes of Might and Magic III then you're pretty much guaranteed to love this I think. For everyone else: it's a fantastic start for this mixtures of strategy, exploration and RPG mechanics that I'm excited to see now available.</p>
<p>Check out the Early Access trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-wUXy2DJ5QU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c62a618d6245fbb14d2bec23b975b46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-wUXy2DJ5QU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Current Features as of the EA release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 completed playable factions - <strong><em>Fossorians</em>, <em>Children of the Source</em>, <em>Sovereign Fleet</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
<li>Story campaign for the Fossorian faction with 4 levels (<em>average playtime &gt;12 hours</em>) + 9 playable skirmish maps.</li>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases and hire the strongest units.</li>
<li>Encounter a wide range of enemies in turn-based combat, use your tactical thinking to gain advantage on the battlefield.</li>
<li>Learn unique moves of your units, deploy your commander's special abilities and outsmart even much stronger opponents.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your enemies in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Available in: English, French, German, Spanish, Polish, Simplified Chinese, Hungarian.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers expect it to be in Early Access for around a year while they implement new features, bug fixes, general improvements and two more factions. There's already multiple tens of hours of content to play through right now.</p>
<p>Linux version seemed to work really nicely too. I'm somewhat in love with the style of the artwork as well. I'm a real sucker for sci-fi and the way this blends everything together looks fantastic in motion. Fun faction designs too. Absolutely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Available from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>. It has Native Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>Unique time-stopping horde-survival game Moon Watch now has a Steam demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't play this demo if you value having any free time at all. Seriously. Moon Watch is delightfully great and properly brings some unique additions to the now very popular horde-survival genre. From the creators of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a>, you know it's gonna be good!</p>
<p>Here you're taking on vampires — in space. That's right. You're smashing into their ship above your planet to hopefully take them down for good. Armed with a deck of weapons, and a unique watch fuelled by "high tech nonsense" and vampire blood, time will stop when you stop moving.</p>
<p>It has the frantic feeling of other survivor likes (hi Vampire Survivors), but gives you more room to think and breathe. Your abilities are from your deck of cards, which all cost energy that you build up while moving. So while stopped, you can flick through them and decide what ability to fire. It feels like a glorious fusion of Slay the Spire and Vampire Survivors in the way you progress.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tf90YqbOxDw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/238d7048b732fb200a47b763bf209b9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tf90YqbOxDw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really interesting mixture of gameplay mechanics in this one, that has thoroughly sucked in my attention something fierce. The demo isn't just a static build either, they're calling it a "Living Demo" as they're going to keep on upgrading it while building upon their unique gameplay.</p>
<p>For anyone who played the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/moon-watch-is-a-time-stopping-horde-survival-deck-builder-from-the-devs-of-backpack-hero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous web demo a highlighted</a> the good news is that there's a lot more to it now with the first two acts, two boss battles, new run rewards, randomised runs and just a whole lot more of everything.</p>
<p>Give it a try <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from the Steam page</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>In Thyria you enter dreams to combat demons in this unique party-based RPG </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I need of a new party-based RPG with dynamic exploration, turn-based combat and a fun gameplay loop? Thyria looks like a good one to pick up.</p>
<p>Thyria blends together exploring a colourful dynamic 2D isometric map, with turn-based battles where you enter the minds of cursed villagers to attempt to purge their demons with your summoned guardians. There's a lot of freedom in how you approach this one with each play-through being different, and with you able to customize your team of guardians throughout the game.</p>
<p>Not just that, but there's a whole time-management part to this too with a day and night cycle where you mix between battling living creatures in the overworld and entering dreams.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ODxW2dxsGpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e0e0e5a1243c4c5a0540a5c45f183a6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ODxW2dxsGpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summon your Guardians and get into the minds of the cursed villagers.</strong> Explore the dreams to collect Soul Dusts, Inks and knowledge. Treat your patient to increase the rewards but also the many risks... Each Guardian will offer a range of spells, and unique abilities. Redouble your strategy and perseverance to overcome the living nightmares, which creep in the heart of the most obscure dreams.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration.</strong> Steer Thyria on a procedurally generated 2D isometric map with varied landscapes. Various places offer exchanges, gifts… but also deception and fights! Maintain an inventory of relics that can optimize (or reduce…) the end of quest rewards. Face the living nightmares on the map using Thyria's arsenal, which will expand as the adventure unfolds. Always keep an eye on the clock to best manage the day / night cycles, the visibility and behavior of nightmares being greatly impacted!</li>
<li><strong>The fights.</strong> Defy the demons of every dream by deploying your Guardians, learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and use strategy to defeat the toughest monsters. The management of time, resources and individual resources will be the key to success!</li>
<li><strong>The laboratory.</strong> Learn how to merge two Soul Jewels and summon new Guardians! Each adventure will be different depending on your team, and each fight can be approached differently. Customize each Guardian: choose and combine spells before assigning them to the Guardian. Choose your spells before assigning them to the Guardian. Skill combinations increase the strategic aspect of each fight, it's up to you to find the right balance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608590/Thyria/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux support on Steam</a>. It's 40% off until October 14th.</p>

      <title>Evolve and fuse monsters in inventory management battler NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters is out today from DiceHit Games, Rogue Duck Interactive and it's another quality one in the inventory management auto-battler genre. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say and this is <em>very</em> similar in style to Backpack Hero, and then Backpack Battles even more so. The idea is to build up a backpack of creatures and items, moving them all around into the best possible position to have the highest possible battle power to take down opponents in automatic battles. It's a pretty cute entry with all the creature designs and is plenty of fun to play through.</p>
<p>As you progress you get monies to expand your backpack with additional slots, which you can place anywhere as long as one slot connects to another. And then you can buy and sell various items and creatures to fill it all up again.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RA9KfkjK5r8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16005ad92ef3d8fc2cabf801dfa6cb2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RA9KfkjK5r8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you <em>haven't</em> played auto-battlers or inventory management games before, I would consider NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters to be a really nice entry to it with the wonderfully sweet creature design and fun fusions. Some creatures have multiple types of fusions to transform, giving you many ways to tweak your inventory as you go depending on what items you can grab from the shop to give them different abilities. It's a pretty relaxed game to play through, with you able to go at your own pace too which is nice for people who don't like to rush.</p>
<p>Having little creatures instead of weapons is an interesting mix-up for the genre, but it really is <em>very</em> much like Backpack Battles. Here though the upgrade mechanic is an additional nice touch, allowing you to experiment quite a lot with your overall build. So even if you went for the same creatures, you can still try out different ways to progress through the battles each time.</p>
<p>The main issue I observed was specific to the Linux version, with some of the little overlay videos being blank. A common problem with the Unity game engine, with its limited support of video codecs on Linux. Trivial bug to solve, so I've let the developer know and they're working on it.</p>
<p>From the developer: "We’re so excited to finally release NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters. This game has been a labour of love from our small team, and we can’t wait to see how players experiment with Cosmions, fusions, and different builds. A big thank you to our devoted community of Duelists for all the support and feedback during development. We couldn’t have done without you." — Bahadır, Lead Developer at DiceHit Games.</p>

      <title>Merge spells to make new crazy combos in An Amazing Wizard: Prologue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An Amazing Wizard: Prologue just launched on Steam giving you a taste of a bigger game to come and if you like Dead Cells combat, along with the idea of fusing spells together to make unique combos this is for you.</p>
<p>While Valve are trying to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/valve-gives-developers-some-big-reasons-to-add-a-demo-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more devs to use demos</a>, we're still getting a few of these Prologue games and this is one you for sure need to be checking out. I still think the name is a bit too <em>generic</em>, but thankfully after now playing it, I can safely say the gameplay is great fun.</p>
<p>Similar in style to the likes of Dead Cells, Wizard of Legend, Skul the Hero Slayer and Noita it sort of blends a lot of their ideas together and if you like any of those you'll feel pretty at home with this one. Here you kill enemies and build up a list of spell scrolls, which you can swap around any time. However, the really fun part is at any time you can speak to the old wise guy and get him to merge two together. The result is that you're given a new spell with a combination of abilities and it means you can make some really cool stuff in it.</p>
<p>In the Prologue there's 60 unique spells, 100 permanent upgrades across 5 elemental play-styles, 100 enchantments and 2 worlds to battle through. The full game will have a <strong>lot</strong> more with 120+ spells across 7 elements, various playable characters, more worlds, more enemies, more bosses and the list goes on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4WTLblT2KY4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05e790366982a5ed171f70e98aba3207.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4WTLblT2KY4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely one not to miss. The action is really fun in this one with how much you can customize your play-through.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920980/An_Amazing_Wizard_Prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out now on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372660/An_Amazing_Wizard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full game</a> is due out early next year.</p>

      <title>Get cooking with tasty ingredients to make creatures in turn-based battler GladiEATers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of points for originality here. GladiEATers has a really fun idea that combines cooking and turn-based battles into something a little quirky. It's announced for a Steam (Windows) release but likely will run great with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Here you cook up a team of food-based monsters to command in turn-based battles and become champion of the CALosseum. With every battle starting off in the kitchen you get your basic ingredients and cook them up against the clock to turn them into powerful creatures. Each mini-game lets you change your GladiEATers’ form and boost its stats, but it’s up to you to choose how to spend your time. So you could create a really powerful strange creature, or send in a whole lot of boiled eggs to overwhelm an opponent.</p>
<p>With both a single-player mode, an endless roguelike mode and even online ranked versus battles this looks delicious. I want it.</p>

<p>More about the developer, MilkBubblesGames: an independent game studio working entirely remotely. Their team, made up of creatives from around the world, shares a love for pixel art. The group includes a designer, two programmers, a sound designer, two composers, and five artists. They came together to create GladiEATers, their first game, which has been in development for nearly three years.</p>

      <title>Swing around with a water gun while cleaning high-rise buildings in Aerial Cleaner</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you like your simpler games that have a fun unique idea then check out Aerial Cleaner, a 2D game about swinging around while cleaning high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Quite an amusing idea actually. Equipped with a water-jet gun, you jump off the roof attached by a rope and swing side to side as you attempt to clean everything up. The water gun recoil will push you towards what you need by firing backwards and swinging, and it's more challenging than it looks. Oh, there's also various weird creepy-crawly creatures that will try to get in your way.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_LQeggNGtRk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c3b127acb8972179cd7d849bf31271b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_LQeggNGtRk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Purpose Water Gun: The water jet gun serves multiple functions: it cleans dirt, propels the player by swinging from the recoil, and acts as a weapon against monsters.</li>
<li>High-Altitude Adventure: Scale skyscrapers with different themes, challenge your high-altitude cleaning skills, and experience the thrill of extreme cleaning missions.</li>
<li>Level Design: Explore diverse level designs, each with unique challenges and obstacles, testing players' reflexes and tactical skills.</li>
<li>Level Challenges: Completing each level's water and time limit challenges earns star rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam. It will release sometime in Q4 2024 with Linux support.</p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2989500/Aerial_Cleaner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>My favourite auto-battler Mechabellum is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing together the explosive destruction from real-time strategy games to the auto-battler genre, Mechabellum is a thoroughly good time and it's out now. <em>Disclosure: my key was originally sent by TriplePoint PR.</em></p>
<p>After being in Early Access for over a year the 1.0 release brings with it a new seasonal system, a new ranking system, new commander specialists to pick before the battle starts, optimizations and more. The game works great on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>While auto-battlers seemed like at one point they would be all the rage with Dota Underlords, Auto Chess and many other attempts they reasonably quickly died off like a bit of a fad. Mechabellum is different though, at least to me, because of just how exciting and ridiculously explosive the action is once it gets going. It feels a lot more strategic than other games in the genre and it's just damn fun to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TcJoUc7NaTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4cbd3c797f43d5bd6da207d20c541e34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TcJoUc7NaTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it being an auto-battler, you don't do anything while the fight is actually happening except sit back and watch the fireworks. Games are based on short rounds, and once you destroy all the enemy units what units <em>you</em> have left are counted up and their power is then used to take down the enemy's total health until one side hits zero. The strategy here is in what units you place down, where you place them and what upgrades and bonuses you pick as the rounds progress. It gets really engrossing and constantly gives me that need of just having one more game before I've ended up spending a good 2-3 hours round after round.</p>
<p>I just love seeing the big units stomp all over the little ones, or seeing big units get absolutely swarmed by lots of little ones. There's so many combinations you can use.</p>
<p>Battles are quick to get into and don't take much time at all to complete, so you can happily play it when you have time to spare and when you're in somewhat of a hurry during a coffee break. It's a great in-between game for people who love strategy games, but don't have hours to spend.</p>
<p>I've put a good bunch of hours into it and there's simply never a boring moment. Worth grabbing for sure.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Minecraft is getting a real creepy new biome and mob, plus item bundles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Live 2024 has been and gone and with it we've been given details on the next new biome and mob coming.</p>
<p>Releasing at some-point in a few months we'll see the Pale Garden biome, along with the new mob the Creaking. The developers said that they wanted to lean more into the scarier side of the game for this one. The Creaking is a mob that only moves when you look away from it, and it looks quite a lot like a tree making it more difficult to see in the dark. Quite a different mob too, since it has a connection to the trees, and you'll need to take down a special creaking heart block to actually destroy them. There's also new special audio for this biome too.</p>
<p>Watch the video reveal of the new biome and mob:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eHEQY3ua_uY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bd7771e8a76b722d03e863d5eefc944.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eHEQY3ua_uY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really love the whole vibe of that biome, good to see Mojang do more like this.</p>
<p>Another nice new feature coming soon is the introduction of Bundles, which were scrapped once before but they're finally becoming a real official thing. It's basically a bag inside your inventory, for you to dump stuff into it to reclaim some inventory slots. Enabling you to go exploring and mining for longer without having to constantly dump items.</p>
<p>See more about that in the below clip, which also goes over the Hardcore mode being added to Bedrock (already in Java):</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-15 released with an important fix for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have an NVIDIA GPU? Use GE-Proton? You should probably make sure you're on GE-Proton 9-15 which was just released. This is a "hotfix" build to clear up some problems from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/ge-proton-9-14-brings-fixes-for-star-citizen-god-of-war-ragnarok/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous recent release</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge -- fixes regression in video playback from 9-14.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git -- fixes regression which causes black textures and stuttering on NVIDIA cards.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git.</li>
<li>import upstream changes for lsteamclient.</li>
<li>update xalia to 0.4.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove deprecated workaround for Total War Rome 2.</li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured - Mortal Kombat 11</em></p>
<p>What's GE-Proton? A special community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris.

      <title>Valve (Steam) begin a direct collaboration with Arch Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is some pretty exciting news! The Arch Linux team have announced a new direct collaboration with Valve (Steam). Something that's not too surprising, since Valve do fund a lot of open source work, and SteamOS for Steam Deck is built directly on Arch Linux so working more closely together makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Posted to the Arch developer <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/RIZSKIBDSLY4S5J2E2STNP5DH4XZGJMR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mailing list</a> by Levente Polyak, the Arch Linux leader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are excited to announce that Arch Linux is entering into a direct collaboration with Valve. Valve is generously providing backing for two critical projects that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting work on a freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on them without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers.</p>
<p>This opportunity allows us to address some of the biggest outstanding challenges we have been facing for a while. The collaboration will speed-up the progress that would otherwise take much longer for us to achieve, and will ultimately unblock us from finally pursuing some of our planned endeavors. We are incredibly grateful for Valve to make this possible and for their explicit commitment to help and support Arch Linux.</p>
<p>These projects will follow our usual development and consensus-building workflows. [RFCs] will be created for any wide-ranging changes. Discussions on this mailing list as well as issue, milestone and epic planning in our GitLab will provide transparency and insight into the work. We believe this collaboration will greatly benefit Arch Linux, and are looking forward to share further development on this mailing list as work progresses.</p>
<p>[RFCs]: https://rfc.archlinux.page/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The secure signing enclave could certainly be an interesting one. What do you think Valve and the Arch team will be cooking up with that? <s>This is something that <em>could</em> perhaps be a useful change for anti-cheat to have a more secure platform on Arch and so SteamOS / Steam Deck, and potentially get more games to enable it for us.</s></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 28/09/24 - 14:13 UTC</strong>: Arch Linux packager and Valve collaborator Campbell Jones, mentioned to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enclave is essentially intended to be a way for us to PGP-sign packages with a single signing key instead of how we do it right now, which is with one personal key per packager. It will not benefit Proton or the anti-cheat situation in any way and is completely unrelated.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve has an amusing new anti-cheat system turning cheaters into frogs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are continuing to build up Deadlock, their fancy new third-person MOBA, with the introduction of a new anti-cheat system that's quite hilarious.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> launched yesterday noted an "initial Anti-Cheat detection system". It comes with a fun feature that allows players to either ban the detected cheater instantly and end the match, or turn the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then ban them after.</p>
<p>Valve devs say this new system is "set to conservative detection levels" while they work on an improved version 2 anti-cheat system that will be "more extensive". You also now have a cheat report option both in-game and post-game, with the main anti-cheat system to go live "in a couple of days".</p>
<p>Apart from that, this update was a reasonably big one too. This update has added in a new hero, Mirage:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6418278801727455129gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6418278801727455129gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19882739971727455727gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19882739971727455727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus there's also now a Custom Match mode and private lobbies got expanded with new options like enabling cheats, selecting the server, make the match public or private, supports post-game and replays and allows for picking a lane.</p>
<p>There's also performance improvements, expanded servers into South Africa, an Italian localization, voice indicators for speaking players, various bug fixes and numerous tweaks to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Deadlock is free to play, and runs on Linux via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. You still need to be invited to play.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper hits 1 million players - multiplayer and modding support to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper is a real gem with a simple yet highly satisfying gameplay loop, and it seems it's done well for Bippinbits. Even though they're working on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-has-you-manually-control-a-massive-planetary-defence-cannon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the incredible looking PVKK</a>, they're not done with Dome Keeper just yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1637320/view/4673137508062083950" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam for the two year release anniversary, a huge milestone has been hit as they said they "just hit 1.000.000 players". For any smaller developer, that really is an incredible thing. Dome Keeper has a Very Positive user rating on Steam with nearly 12,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>Some other fun facts were shared with 12,256,935 hours spent by players in the game, with 28,249 playing for over 50 hours and 81,867 managed to dig out the whole map while playing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UgbaE75yYPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bded6a20882d9d52ebe6d2eebdd70e03.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UgbaE75yYPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's been a lot of content updates to the game but there's also more to come. A balancing update with fixes ins due in October and after that in 2025 — multiplayer and modding. The developer said local multiplayer was easy enough, but still needs work, but online support has been much harder but they "still want to take a stab at it and see if we can get it done".</p>
<p>As they said it also means " it will get quiet on the development side at least for the rest of this year" as they have work to do but it's "also a big reason we want to fully enable and foster mods" with more info to come on that.</p>
<p>Dome Keeper has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can buy Dome Keeper from:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a hand-drawn world of cosmic horrors, the upcoming 2D action-platformer metroidvania, Voidwrought looks like a real gem. Especially so if you're a Hollow Knight fan waiting on Hollow Knight: Silksong. Announced for release on October 24th, this one should work nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Warside looks great for turn-based tactics Advance Wars fans, set for launch in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With inspiration (clearly) from Advance Wars and other wargames of the past, Warside is looking really good and they now have a real date, new trailer and demo available. Another one made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Take charge as one of twelve powerful Commanders, each touting distinct passive skills and Battle Powers. Wield these boons to change the tide of war and ensure victory through 30+ missions in a robust single-player Story Campaign. Additionally there will be a Skirmish mode, local and online co-op and local and online PvP too. Plus a built-in mission editor for anyone to make extras.</p>
<p>The developer has now confirmed the plan is to release on 28th January, 2025 and there's the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H0mJkTpe7ZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37c694cacca930f0089e54f6bc35bc5f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H0mJkTpe7ZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Warside began as a distraction to channel my energy into after an accident left me immobile for 18 months. My love for pixelated Wargames of the past helped it blossom into something special.” said Andy Savage, founder of LAVABIRD. "We hope you like our brand-new demo available now, and enjoy our modern take on the genre. We're excited to be part of the recent tactics resurgence and can't wait to show you Warside in full when it launches in January!"</p>
<p>At time of writing on Linux the demo is an empty download, so you'll need to force Proton on it until they fix that.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368300/Warside/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 gets a new Classes Overview Trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My most anticipated title for this year is looking awesome. Streets of Rogue 2 has a brand new Classes Overview Trailer for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>Not all classes will be available at the Early Access release though, as the developer will continue building up the game. Unlike some Early Access releases, this will not be a nearly-finished game, it will still be in constant development.</p>
<p>The new trailer shows off the freedom of choice you get highlighting a whole bunch of characters, each of them with their own abilities and unique way of dealing with various situations. There's the standard city-wrecking Soldier, a Cultist that allows you to pull in lots of followers, the crazed Gorilla that can topple buildings, you'll be able to go on heists as a Thief, or just settle down casually as a Farmer. Plus many more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oUou-ww78dM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52cff8437eb1a071a3afd3d6c4e40653.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oUou-ww78dM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This game really seems like it's going to fill every need I have. It's like the craziness of the original, blended with classic-styled Grand Theft Auto on steroids. I am so excited for this it's unreal. <em>I need it right now.</em></p>
<p>Streets of Rogue 2 comes to Early Access on October 22nd. As far as we know it will have Native Linux support.</p>

<p>tobspr Games have a big hit on their hands here with the chilled-out factory-building automation sim shapez 2 managed to do really well in the first month. Currently in Early Access it has full Native Linux support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/4612337645064181837" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer mentioned they originally project it to sell about 90,000 in the first month but it's sold now over 273,000! For a smaller developer that's really impressive and it's life on Steam has only just begun. They said they "were completely overwhelmed and surprised by the response and success of the game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SFoml48FR2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be3417b8476aac2e78935fe3a3aa1d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SFoml48FR2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how many sales were across different platforms. Only 1.9% were on Linux and 2.9% of macOS. The developer also noted Linux has been a bit problematic as "it seems that Linux players had by far the most issues on launch, with sound problems and some crashes" but a lot of those should already be solved with an updated Unity game engine version.</p>
<p>Now that it's properly secure, they've also detailed some of their plans to keep expanding the game by bringing in more developers, along with adjusting their content plans. They're brainstorming new content, some of which may possibly need a new saved game but they will share more on that later.</p>
<p>They're working on multi-threading to improve performance to spread the load across more CPU cores. One example given was how on a i7-10700 CPU simulating 1.3 million buildings went from 0.8 FPS to 43.7 FPS! They're aiming to have this in the next major update.</p>

      <title>Steam Subscriber Agreement updated for disputes removing the need for individual arbitration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a change to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, which has been updated to remove the need for individual arbitration during disputes.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4696781406111167991" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve eliminated the requirement that disputes be resolved by individual arbitration. As always, we encourage you to contact Steam Support when you have any issues, as that will nearly always be the best way to reach a solution. But if that doesn’t work, the updated SSA now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration. We’ve also removed the class action waiver, as well as the cost and fee-shifting provisions, that were in prior versions of the SSA.<br/>
<br/>
For many of our customers (including the ones living in the EU and UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Quebec), these updates have limited impact as the arbitration rules did not apply to them even before the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the section of the Subscriber Agreement now says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10. APPLICABLE LAW/JURISDICTION</p>
<p>Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener" target="_new">https://support.steampowered.com/</a>. If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.</p>
<p>For All Subscribers Outside the European Union and United Kingdom:</p>
<p>You and Valve agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and Washington law, excluding conflict of laws principles and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governs all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this Agreement; or (iii) your use of Steam, your Account or the Content and Services. You and Valve agree that all disputes and claims between you and Valve (including any dispute or claim that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement) shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction. You and Valve hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or venue in such courts.</p>
<p>If the laws where you live mandate alternative dispute resolution options, you may seek a remedy under those options. If you are a consumer who lives in Russia, you may also seek a remedy with local Russian state courts.</p>
<p>For EU and UK Subscribers:</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the law of the country where you have your habitual residence.</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, the performance or the validity of the Subscriber Agreement, an amicable solution may be sought before any legal action. You can file your complaint at <a href="http://help.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://help.steampowered.com</a>. The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution website for EU consumers at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>. Participation in this website is not available to US companies, which is why Valve is not registered there. However, insofar as your complaint concerns the behavior of Valve’s data protection representative Valve GmbH you can file your complaint there.</p>
<p>In the event that an Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure fails, or if either Valve or you prefer not to resort to Alternative Dispute Resolution, you may bring proceedings in the courts of the place where you are domiciled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can view the original details on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240925000911/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#11" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wayback Machine Archive</a>.</p>
<p>From my admittedly limited legal knowledge, this seems like a <em>good</em> change for anyone who has a dispute with Valve, since individual arbitration often gives a lot of the power to companies and not consumers.</p>

      <title>Major flaw found in CUPS - time to run Linux system updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yesterday details went public about a major security issue that was found in CUPS, the open source printing system.</p>
<p>If you wish to read all the details you can do so in the <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Simone Margaritelli who found the problems. It's pretty technical stuff that most normal users likely won't understand, but the main point is that if you're on a desktop Linux system especially there's a high chance your system is vulnerable to it (especially if you use printers).</p>
<p>The issues are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-47176 | <strong>cups-browsed</strong> &lt;= 2.0.1 binds on UDP INADDR_ANY:631 trusting any packet from any source to trigger a <code class="inline-code">Get-Printer-Attributes</code> IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-47076 | <strong>libcupsfilters</strong> &lt;= 2.1b1 <code class="inline-code">cfGetPrinterAttributes5</code> does not validate or sanitize the IPP attributes returned from an IPP server, providing attacker controlled data to the rest of the CUPS system.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-47175 | <strong>libppd</strong> &lt;= 2.1b1 <code class="inline-code">ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2</code> does not validate or sanitize the IPP attributes when writing them to a temporary PPD file, allowing the injection of attacker controlled data in the resulting PPD.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-47177 | <strong>cups-filters</strong> &lt;= 2.0.1 <code class="inline-code">foomatic-rip</code> allows arbitrary command execution via the <code class="inline-code">FoomaticRIPCommandLine</code> PPD parameter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Summed up by Margaritelli they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A remote unauthenticated attacker can silently replace existing printers’ (or install new ones) IPP urls with a malicious one, resulting in arbitrary command execution (on the computer) when a print job is started (from that computer).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaritelli also suggests actually removing and disabling any services for cups-browsed, especially if you don't need it and then running updates. Regularly checking for updates is just sound advice anyway, make sure you're up to date often for security fixes.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck 2.3 out now with a fresh UI design, 3DS emulators return</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/emudeck-23-beta-brings-a-new-unified-ui-and-multi-language-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta period I covered previously</a>, the EmuDeck team have released EmuDeck 2.3 that comes with the big user interface overhaul. Not only that but Nintendo 3DS emulators have made a return.</p>
<p>Hold up, what's EmuDeck again? It's a system to make emulation easy across Steam Deck / SteamOS, desktop Linux, Windows and Android. It sets everything up for you and with this release, it should be easier than ever to use thanks to the fancy new interface.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main <a href="https://emudeck.github.io/blog/2026/09/25/emudeck-update-09-26-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> as noted in v2.3 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New unified UI.</li>
<li>Button to remove SRM entries in manage emulators.</li>
<li>Partial Multilanguage support.</li>
<li>Auto setup emulators on your device's language.</li>
<li>Lime3DS, a Citra fork has been added.</li>
<li>Citra is back! We've added PabloMK7 Citra's fork.</li>
<li>EmuDecky - Now you can update emulators from gaming mode (install from EmuDeck, not the Decky Store).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how the new UI looks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17791339761727363931gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17791339761727363931gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power major expansion released, plus a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power along with the free 1.13.0 "Basileus" update have launched, and it seems like it's actually really good news for Paradox.</p>
<p>Lately, Paradox have had quite a lot of issues with their releases. From cancelling games completely, to DLC for various games that have reviewed pretty poorly overall. So it's nice to see that Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power, at least from Steam user reviews, is showing up really well with a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>What's new in the DLC the main points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative Government:</strong> Experience medieval rule outside of the feudal system with a new style of empire management. A web of Governors jockeys for position in the empire with intrigue and power, sometimes rewarding merit and sometimes rewarding perfidy. Only a truly skilled Emperor can keep these squabbling forces in line.</li>
<li><strong>The Family Estate:</strong> Run and manage a powerful Family Estate, the seat of your House’s power, even when you hold no other land. Construct new buildings and improvements to further your power and influence within an administrative empire.</li>
<li><strong>Influence System:</strong> Build up a character’s influence within an administrative empire to climb the rungs of bureaucracy. Raise your status in the realm and gather more power for yourself. Start as a landless noble on an estate, and compete for valuable provinces to govern before making your bid for the Purple.</li>
<li><strong>A Life of Adventure:</strong> Freely roam the map, untied to any realm or holding, going wherever the winds of fortune blow you. Fulfill contracts as a landless adventurer, even through the generations, building up a reputation of your own. Earn gold, prestige and fame traveling the globe until you decide to settle down and claim land you have earned through merit.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Successor or Caesar:</strong> Spend the influence you have gathered to determine the course of the Empire and get the successor you want, whether a royal family member, a powerful noble, a martial hero, or any other candidate you can rally the people behind. The Emperor can even opt to co-rule if the burden of the throne is too much for one person.</li>
<li><strong>New Byzantine Flavor Content:</strong> New events, monuments and activities built around the Byzantine theme, including chariot racing.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetic Additions:</strong> A Byzantine-themed UI skin and new court fashions for your characters, new 2D event art, new on-map monuments of the Byzantine world, new on-map holding designs, and a Byzantine throne room for Royal Court sessions, among other aesthetic improvements. New music inspired by Orthodox holy chants is also included.</li>
</ul>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ueVWWXG4JRg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c13aca10707d876d47f39ec28b10a008.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ueVWWXG4JRg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full details on all the changes available on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/now-available-roads-to-power-free-1-13-0-basileus-update.1705102/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paradox forum</a>. As usual for Paradox strategy games, it's lengthy and wordy and full of adjustments everywhere. The free patch that was released with it is also, surprisingly, pretty darn feature-filled as well containing a bunch of new game rules you can use, they added Court View and Court Artifacts to base game, historical characters can now appear across the map, a new starting year option, new events and so on.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting new free features for all players though is the "Choose a New Destiny" feature, so that you get to pick what happens to your game after you die - as long as you have a valid heir that is. The new options sound quite fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When you die, you now get the opportunity to switch to another character of your Dynasty that is not necessarily your direct Heir. Our game is a dynastic simulator, and we want to unlock playing through more branches of your Dynasty!</li>
<li>Players will be offered up to three categories of Destiny characters: An Interesting Destiny, a Challenging Destiny, and an Adventurous Destiny. Each category aims to offer a different flavor. The last category specifically will allow you to go Adventuring, if you own Roads to Power!</li>
<li>You can also select a Favorite Child (direct child or grand-child), who will then always appear as a New Destiny character. They will not get any extra titles or gold - in fact their siblings might get a bit jealous of their ‘favorite’ status.</li>
<li>For those who like to roll the Die of Fate - we have a special “Random Destiny” option with several random variants, to continue as any Dynasty character. It might still be your Heir, if that is what Fate determines.</li>
<li>You only get to Choose a New Destiny if you have a valid heir when you die. Securing your succession is an important part of CK3, and we want everyone to keep respecting that goal.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Din&#39;s Champion is dynamic rogue-lite RPG styled like Terraria from Soldak Entertainment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soldak Entertainment make some pretty quirky RPGs with a good few die-hard fans, and now they're trying something a bit different with Din's Champion.</p>
<p>Blending the basic theme of Terraria with 2D side-scrolling where you mine and gather resources, craft items and explore the world but with Soldak's dynamic RPG systems to give you a really unique game. The graphical style of it is a bit…<em>odd</em>, it looks like a Terraria "HD" mod almost but it seems to make up for it in all the gameplay systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9055945611727360653gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You have to build up a town, which can end up with 100s of NPCs that you can equip to help you out. Which you'll probably need, since the monsters can "form uprisings, start wars, set up ambushes, and attack your town". Heck, even without monsters there's a lot going on. Your NPCs can get plagues and curses, you have sneaky assassins to worry about too and then there's the physics system with various terrain that will collapse around you, gases can build up, liquids will be flowing and much more.</p>
<p>Character creation and upgrades sound interesting too, with the developer noting there's "over 50,000 combinations". Each run through should be unique with different bosses, biomes, monsters, items, traps, objects, and quests with is where the whole rogue-lite thing comes in.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress to get Lua support for modding, plus there&#39;s now babies and children</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Dwarf Fortress update has been released bringing with it some needed fixes, along with babies and some fun news about modding.</p>
<p>This is a Fortress Mode update, separate from the opt-in Adventure Mode Beta which still isn't ready for a main release just yet. The devs gave a word of warning though that it might nukes saves until a Steam issue is solved. Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4657374909372690154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux trainer crash fixed (again).</li>
<li>Added crash guard for bad civilian alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics additions/changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Dwarves/humans/elves/goblins/kobolds have child and baby images, new equipment, and palette support.</li>
<li>Garden and crop plants have more images.</li>
<li>Mandible portrait fixed for experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other bug fixes/tweaks</p>
<ul>
<li>Good/bad thoughts about tombs work.</li>
<li>Poisonous forgotten beasts work more reliably.</li>
<li>Various minor tweaks to input/layout.</li>
<li>Fixed drinks being destroyed on unretire.</li>
<li>Fixed a few broken sorts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The extra fun bit though — Lua modding is coming. They said it will allow you to "literally change the code to make custom behaviours and adapt the systems more expansively than ever" and it will also be the foundation for "the upcoming procedural magic system which will be added to all modes". Check out the video on it:</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.4.1 brings improvements for launchers, more robust D3D8, lots of game fixes for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11 for Linux used in Wine / Proton, DXVK version 2.4.1 is out today. This is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> able to run so many Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of improvements in this release!</p>
<h4>General improvements</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The size for memory chunks is now determined dynamically based on the amount of memory the application has already allocated.<br/>
This should improve the out-of-the-box behaviour in various game launchers; the <code class="inline-code">dxvk.maxChunkSize</code> option was removed accordingly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Vulkan swap chain would not always be recreated appropriately in a native Wayland environment. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4252" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4252</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with descriptor pools growing too large on Nvidia cards in some situations. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4166" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4166</a>)</li>
<li>Changed default shader code generation for DXBC <code class="inline-code">mad</code> instructions to work around flickering issues in games that use different vertex shaders to render the same geometry in multiple render passes. The <code class="inline-code">d3d11.longMad</code> and <code class="inline-code">d3d9.longMad</code> options were removed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4></h4>
<h4>D3D8 / D3D9</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall robustness of the D3D8 implementation with error handling and fixed various memory leaks.</li>
<li>Slightly improved performance by optimizing vertex buffer uploads. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4275" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4275</a>)</li>
<li>Significantly improved performance in some games using Software Vertex Processing. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4274</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed full-screen presentation issues in some Game Maker games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4245" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4245</a>)</li>
<li>Removed <code class="inline-code">VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT</code> from textures that don't need it. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4176" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4176</a>)</li>
<li>Enabled strict float emulation by default on AMDVLK now that this driver optimizes the pattern emitted by DXVK. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4203" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4203</a>). Do note that this was already the case on RADV.</li>
<li><strong>Chrome: Gold Edition</strong>: Enabled 60 FPS limit to work around game issues at higher frame rates. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4260</a>)</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h4>D3D11 / DXGI</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Worked around an issue where various games would misbehave when the amount of available VRAM is reported as a power of two.</li>
<li>Changed shader code generation for dot product instructions to be more in line with code generation on native drivers.<br/>
This fixes a water rendering issue in <strong>Trails through Daybreak</strong> on Nvidia. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4162" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4162</a>)</li>
<li>Implemented a basic dead code elimination pass to avoid generating invalid SPIR-V shaders in rare situations.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> All these shader-related changes will invalidate fossilize databases.</li>
<li>Games will now leave fullscreen mode when the game window loses focus.<br/>
This is closer to Windows behaviour and fixes various issues with games hanging on some setups. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2675" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2675</a>)</li>
<li>Made sure the built-in options in DXVK for a game take precedence over the options enabled/disabled by DXVK-NVAPI.<br/>

<p>For the full detail see the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.4.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you don't actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the wild side, you can upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut is a big free upgrade coming in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slay the Princess is probably one of the best horror visual novels around, with absolutely glowing reviews everywhere and it's about to get bigger, for free. The developers have announced Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut, a free upgrade that's going to release on October 24th.</p>
<p>In short it's going to add in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expands the game by roughly 35%. This means thousands of new voice lines, over a thousand new illustrations, and 17 tracks of brand new music.</li>
<li>Adds significant glow-ups for The Fury, The Den, and the Apotheosis, each of which has over three times as much stuff to see as they had in the base game.</li>
<li>Introduces three brand new Princesses that branch off of The Damsel, the Prisoner, and the Spectre.</li>
<li>Adds an entirely new ending to the game.</li>
<li>Adds a deep, interactive gallery to help you chart your progress across over 420 unlocks and that brings back your best (and worst) memories with the Princess.</li>
<li>Provides subtitle support for: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, European Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, German, Polish, French, Russian, and Italian.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve dev Mike Blumenkrantz details a new proposal for speedier Wayland Protocols development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the news recently about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/frog-protocols-announced-to-try-and-speed-up-wayland-protocol-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Frog Protocols for Wayland</a> coming from another frustrated Valve developer, now Mike Blumenkrantz has jumped in with a different proposal to speed things up.</p>
<p>I won't repeat all the issues but in short: Wayland Protocols take too long to be developed, reviewed and actually made into a real thing due to various governance problems. So in a fresh blog post titled "<a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/My-Wayland-Your-Wayland-Our-Wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My Wayland Your Wayland Our Wayland</a>", Blumenkrantz announced their new proposal that essentially boils down to adding in an official "experimental" stage for protocols.</p>
<p>As detailed in the currently open <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/339" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wayland-protocols has struggled with development practices for many years. This stagnation typically comes in two flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>barrier to entry</li>
<li>review hell</li>
</ul>
<p>By adding a third stage of protocol lifetimes, the "experimental" stage, the barrier to entry for new protocol development can be lowered, and momentum can be established in order to carry new protocols through <code class="inline-code">staging/</code> to <code class="inline-code">stable/</code> and broad adoption.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">experimental/</code> - breaking changes allowed, iterative development</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">staging/</code> - no breaking changes allowed, protocols are versioned, fewer changes expected, begin deployment/testing</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">stable/</code> - no breaking changes allowed, versioning is still permitted, no changes expected, safe for production use</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Blumenkrantz goes into a fair bit more detail on how it would work, and it does sound like a promising idea, along with a change to how other developers involved will "vote" on if they think it's good or not that will hopefully prevent experimental protocols sitting forever never getting properly reviewed.</p>
<p>Additionally it looks like both Daniel Stone and Mike Blumenkrantz have been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/338" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accepted</a> into Wayland Protocols governance as members of Mesa.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws head to Steam as Ubisoft return to same-day releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems they all come back in the end. Ubisoft put out a new financial targets <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a>, and in it they confirmed a move back to same-day releases on Steam starting with Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has seen a release date delay and will now instead release on 14th February 2025, as Ubisoft say they are taking on the learnings from the "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws". On top of that they are "departing" from the Season Pass model with everyone getting access at the same time, and pre-orders will get the first expansion free.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is also coming to Steam and will release on 21st November.</p>
<p>From the statement release Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly, with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands.</p>
<p>Although the tangible benefits of the Company’s transformation are taking longer than anticipated to materialize, we keep on our strategy, focusing on two key verticals – Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences – with the objective to drive growth, recurrence and robust free cash flow generation in our business.</p>
<p>In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while delighting players. As a result, beyond the first important short-term actions undertaken, the Executive Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, is launching a review aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders.</p>
<p>Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform Nexus Mods app adds support for Mod Collections, fixes REDmod on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app that's currently in development has a new 0.6.1 release available for testing with some nice improvements. Eventually this will replace Vortex when it's ready.</p>
<p>Firstly, as a reminder, if you've tested previous versions you need to <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/faq/#why-do-i-have-to-uninstall-everything-to-update-the-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">completely remove</a> everything. As it's early days, they're not supporting app upgrades yet. That will come much later.</p>
<p>As for what's new: the big one is a Collections feature, which is still experimental. This allows you to install multiple mods together in one. Currently only supports mods from Nexus Mods and it's only available for Premium users right now but eventually free users will be able to use it.</p>
<p>There's also some new UI work to use the new tree view, and grouped by the mod page on Nexus Mods. Grouping can be turned off too if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16633292661727257693gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16633292661727257693gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some more enhancements for Cyberpunk 2077 modding as well, like detecting if the REDmod DLC is missing and prompt the user to install it if required. Additionally, they fixed up REDmod on Linux as they've set up a framework for Windows apps / tools on Linux <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1989" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using Protontricks</a>. Nice to see one open source project help another — this is why open source is great.</p>
<p><em>The app still only works with Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley until more features are rolled out.</em></p>
<p>Various other changes in the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.6.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Metro Awakening (VR) releases November 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vertigo Games are releasing the VR game Metro Awakening on November 7, so it may be time to dust off your VR kit for this one. Hopefully SteamVR and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> will be able to handle it. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">even more hints towards Valve's next VR system</a>, it would be a good time for Valve to keep improving SteamVR for Linux wouldn't it.</p>
<p>It's a standalone prequel to Metro 2033, so you don't even need to have played the others in the series.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds releases February 28, 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the two previous games World and RISE being Steam Deck Verified, I'm hopeful that Monster Hunter Wilds will also be playable on Steam Deck (and Desktop Linux) with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> when it launches February 28, 2025.</p>
<p>The release date was announced during Sony's State of Play and if you've played any of the previous games, you'll largely know what to expect. Big battles against lots of varied fearsome foes. The new trailer shows off the flagship monster at the center of the story in Monster Hunter Wilds, Arkveld. The trailer also showcases plenty of the different environments and weather systems at play too. Definitely looks to be the most varied in the series so far.</p>
<p>Brand new trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZMBqJZW6_9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d35cd84b87220aa01f81c446578e3fc6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZMBqJZW6_9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I have to admit I'm really out of date on Monster Hunter, I really need to go back through the last two and give them a thorough play-through as this really looks awesome. Will you be picking it up?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-releases-october-31-with-the-playstation-overlay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> wasn't the only Horizon announcement from Sony's State of Play, with LEGO Horizon Adventures set to arrive on November 14.</p>
<p>Like other Sony releases it will require a PlayStation Network Account. They haven't mentioned the PlayStation Overlay though that breaks online play for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-only-on-steam-deck-due-to-playstation-network-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT</a> on Steam Deck / Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, requires a workaround for Desktop Linux in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a> and will be included in Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered too. So we <em>may</em> have some issues with this one as well. Will have to wait and see.</p>

      <title>Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered announced for December 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered are real and they're coming to PC on December 10, with Aspyr Media once again taking control of updating older games.</p>
<p>Much like Aspyr did with STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter, STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection and Tomb Raider I-III Remastered. While no doubt the awful release of the Battlefront Classic Collection is still in some peoples minds, this is a single-player game, so no server-issue problems (and their other two releases are positively reviewed).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7pRyL8y7vZ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac9868131b631dd3e413e1152e50cefc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7pRyL8y7vZ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Aspyr said they were able to get the full source code from Crystal Dynamics so they have the basis for all the "exact same combat, puzzles, and boss fights, with the same balance and feel, as the original" - so it should be pretty difficult to mess this one up.</p>
<p>What can we actually expect from it then? Updated controls and camera controls, updated graphics, there's now a map and compass to assist your travels, a photo mode, real-time shadows, a day and night cycle (that was cut from the original release), a graphics toggle between new and old and more.</p>
<p>Unless Aspyr do something weird it should work fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>More details in the Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-launches-on-ps5-ps4-dec-10/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <title>The new Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailer shows off a really big dragon fight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is releasing October 31st, and the latest trailer shown off during Sony's State of Play is action-packed.</p>
<p>The game is already Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, so it should hopefully work well. That goes for Desktop Linux too. If it's verified on the Deck, your chosen desktop Linux distribution should be good to go too. That is, unless it needs some silly launch option <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like God of War Ragnarök</a>.</p>
<p>The latest trailer is mostly a big dragon fight, and exactly what I wanted to see from it, check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AUOLOMDH-7M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0a4972f173bf624d4fb43734b1fbffb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AUOLOMDH-7M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Enter Thedas, a vibrant world of rugged wilderness, treacherous labyrinths, and glittering cities. The world is teetering on a knife’s edge while corrupt gods unleash havoc across the continent. Nations war, and factions splinter. Who will you trust? From the Arlathan Forest to the back alleys of Minrathous, this is a broken world. Your actions will affect the fate of Thedas forever.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dramatic Single-Player Campaign</strong> — When corrupt Elven Gods threaten Thedas, lead the charge to save it. Rook isn’t afraid of a fight, no matter the odds. No matter the cost.</li>
<li><strong>Vibrant &amp; Diverse Environments</strong> — Enter a vivid fantasy world, and experience imaginative new locations as well as some you’ve heard of but never seen.</li>
<li><strong>Larger-than-life Foes</strong> — Battle darkspawn, demons from beyond the Veil, dragons that rule the skies, and unique enemies as you advance your quest and fight for Thedas’s future.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered releases October 31 with the PlayStation Overlay</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it really didn't need it, October 31 will give us Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered as announced during Sony's State of Play. Yes really, it's happening, it's a real thing.</p>
<p>Hold on a minute, it's how old? No, it can't be. How is it 7 years since the original release? Is time speeding up as I get older or what?</p>
<p>The current version of the game works well on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, and is Steam Deck Verified. However, the new Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered might come with some issues, as Sony confirmed in their blog post it will have the PlayStation Overlay, which is what completely breaks online play for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-only-on-steam-deck-due-to-playstation-network-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully it's not forced, and perhaps it will have an opt-out for Steam Deck like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which means Desktop Linux users may need the launch option.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer anyway:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kMN-x9goE7M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4633a82298831f83c32935416575c385.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kMN-x9goE7M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sony say it will have "over 10 hours of re-recorded conversation, mocap and countless graphical improvements that bring the game to the same visual fidelity as its critically acclaimed sequel Horizon Forbidden West". You will also see various upgrades to characters that brings "them in line with current generation advances in character models and rendering"</p>
<p>For the PC version there will be support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3.1 with frame generation, along with various accessibility features that were first introduced in Horizon Forbidden West.</p>
<p>The new edition will be a $9.99 upgrade for existing owners on PC.</p>

      <title>My Time at Evershine is the next from Pathea Games following My Time at Sandrock</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My Time is officially its own series now, with a third game announced recently with My Time at Evershine following on from My Time at Sandrock and My Time at Portia.</p>
<p>Both previous games work great on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. My Time at Sandrock is also Steam Deck Verified, with My Time at Portia only Steam Deck Playable - so their support got better with the more recent game. For this one, they say on their new Kickstarter in the FAQ it will support the Steam Deck again too. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign launched today, and met the goal in only 35 minutes with it nearly hitting $330,000 already and it jumps up every time I look. Clearly the My Time series remains popular.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Y4nq2iN6ZmU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/efa42a3522e8ee37335b1d6c95827877.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Y4nq2iN6ZmU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All New Story-driven Campaign - </strong>Be the Governor of a brand-new settlement on the fringes of the Free Cities, facing the almighty Duvos Empire. Recruit settlers, build infrastructure, tame the wilds, and lead your people to create a new idyllic stronghold for the Alliance filled with enchanting characters and memorable stories to enjoy. As tensions rise and a powerful antagonist emerges, the stakes are higher than ever, expect surprising twists, heartfelt moments, plenty of adventure, and hours of fun.</li>
<li><strong>New Art Direction - </strong><em>My Time At Evershine</em> is the most beautiful and realistic game in the franchise to date. Environments are more expansive and varied, characters look more realistic, and animations are motion-captured to create a more believable world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiplayer Co-op - </strong>For the first time in the <em>My Time</em> series, the campaign can be enjoyed both solo and in co-op mode with up to four players, making it perfect for family and friends. The host controls the pace of the main story, while all players share resources and money, allowing everyone to collaborate and contribute to the adventure together.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build a Society - </strong>This ambitious sequel casts players as the all-powerful Governor, who can not only build new facilities, and explore but also command a team of recruitable and customizable NPCs. These NPCs handle the routine tasks like construction and resource gathering, allowing the Governor to focus on more larger, important decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Meaningful Relationships - </strong>Social play was a key part of <em>My Time At Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time At Portia.</em> In <em>My Time At Evershine</em> Pathea is set to expand these systems even further. Players can recruit up to 3 followers to stay with them during day-to-day tasks or they can dispatch them to do their bidding across Northern Eufala. In this new installment, relationship-building is even more dynamic, with additional poses, interactions, and flirting options. RPG players will love the deep character interactions and the ability to forge meaningful relationships, with romanceable characters integrated into the storyline and more opportunities to develop connections earlier in the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Tame A Wild New Frontier - </strong>3 years after the events of<em> My Time at Sandrock</em>, the Duvos Empire has taken over the Orzu Ruins which Ethea also claims as their own, leading to a tense situation just north of the Alliance of Free Cities border in the Northern Eufaula region. In response, the Alliance has launched the North Development Plan to move settlers into the area and establish a new City-State for better defense. Evershine is one of six major new settlements in the area and will prove pivotal in the ongoing hostilities.</li>
<li><strong>Mod Support - </strong><em>My Time at Evershine</em> will endeavor to include full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to customize and expand their RPG experience. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, the possibilities for creativity and new content are endless.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They've certainly come a long way since Planet Explorers from 2016, where they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/planet-explorers-goes-free-as-pathea-games-lose-the-multiplayer-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lost a bunch of code in 2019</a> and ended up making it free. Nice to see them now doing so well. They also ended up releasing the <a href="https://github.com/pathea-games/planetexplorers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code</a> for Planet Explorers, although it's <em>not</em> open source.</p>

      <title>Fight off the immense hordes in Halls of Torment 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's finally here and it's finished. Halls of Torment, my favourite bullet-heaven survivor-like that has the style of classic Diablo with Vampire Survivor gameplay is out now.</p>
<p>Absolutely packed full of content. Fight across 6 stages, with 11 playable characters and 100s of items and variants to find. You'll find over 35 unique bosses, over 70 unique monsters, 500 quests to complete and a whole lot of quests to do to unlock various traits and upgrades.</p>
<p>With the 1.0 release today it adds in the last main stage, new challenges, artifacts that will modify the gameplay, new game modes, 16:10 support, lots of quality of life fixes and loads more to find. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JdQweTEsOUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12e755eacdb544b3aa69cb5d13f9b108.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JdQweTEsOUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "We're very excited for the 1.0 release of Halls of Torment. It's been an extraordinary journey for us so far, and we're looking forward to seeing the players' reactions to the feature complete version of the game. We've added a lot of late game content for seasoned HoT players, but at the same time we've also improved the experience for newcomers. We think it has become a solid and well-rounded game, and we hope a lot of new players will enjoy it."</p>
<p>While it's technically finished, they will still be updating it although they admit they "don’t know exactly how to proceed next" but there will be smaller updates and perhaps some additional features to come.</p>
<p>Nice to see another <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> game with Native Linux support see a full release! It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>An incredibly easy recommendation for you. It doesn't get easier than this for me: just go buy it. Great fun. </p>
<p>You <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Advance Wars fans should check out Athena Crisis with the 1.0 release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a heavy dose of ideas from Advance Wars, Nakazawa Tech / Null Games released the 1.0 version of Athena Crisis.</p>
<p>What to expect from it? Well, if you somehow don't know what Advance Wars is: Athena Crisis is a modern turn-based strategy game that brings a full single-player campaign, ranked and casual online multiplayer modes with up to 7 players at once.

      <title>Behaviour Interactive has acquired Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, Behaviour Interactive who made Dead by Daylight announced they have acquired Darkest Dungeon developer Red Hook Studios.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media the Behaviour Interactive account <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The way is lit. The path is clear.”<br/>
<br/>
Today, we’re ecstatic to announce our acquisition of Red Hook Studios. Darkest Dungeon has long been a series we’ve admired, enjoyed (and maybe even lost a little sleep over) as fans, and the opportunity to welcome Red Hook as a fully independent studio under the Behaviour banner is nothing short of a thrill. We look forward to supporting Red Hook as they continue to do what they do best: put your sanity to the test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will no doubt sting a little, and continues to show the gaming industry being quite messy, considering Behaviour Interactive closed down Midwinter Entertainment and cancelled their Project T <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-project-t-has-been-cancelled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only six days ago</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15957532041727185090gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15957532041727185090gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Darkest Dungeon II</em></p>
<p>From the press releases:</p>
<p>"It's a privilege to welcome a developer of Red Hook's caliber," stated Rémi Racine, Behaviour's co-founder and CEO. "Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher – to make Behaviour synonymous with horror and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games. Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come."</p>
<p>"We've found kindred spirits in the Behaviour team," stated Chris Bourassa, Red Hook's co-founder. "Both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games. Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities. Behaviour's support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook's future and focus fully on transforming Darkest Dungeon into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre."</p>
<p>"Joining forces with Behaviour is exciting on multiple levels," added Tyler Sigman, the second of Red Hook's co-founders. "They have demonstrated a commitment to allowing our team to continue developing Darkest Dungeon in the manner we know best, but with the benefit of their considerable knowledge and resources. We are stronger together than apart. Critically, there is a shared love of Darkest Dungeon, and with Behaviour's help, we can delve even deeper into the franchise."</p>
<p>"Darkest Dungeon offers a natural complement to Dead by Daylight," stated Stephen Mulrooney, Behaviour's Chief Product and Technical Officer. "Both franchises occupy unique points on the horror spectrum, and both offer their players deep, innovative gameplay and original, eldritch worlds. We're so excited to add Darkest Dungeon to Behaviour's horror portfolio. Not just because we're huge fans of the games, but also because of the unparalleled creativity and passion demonstrated by Chris, Tyler, and every member of the Red Hook team."</p>

      <title>Chill diorama builder Tiny Glade is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you like just chilling and building things as if you're painting the screen, then you may want to take a look at Tiny Glade that just released.</p>
<p>As casual as gaming comes, Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game where you just build up whatever you want. There's no timers, no quests, no combat. Just you doodling some castles or whatever else you can come up with. This was easily going to be a hit and it certainly is with it already getting an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from users on Steam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CdWpq2efN8Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3320c22e3b2f4c041ffa8fcb1f88e0c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CdWpq2efN8Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo was really impressive with the way everything just flows together so nicely. It may not be the type of game I'm personally going to go and pick up, but that doesn't stop me being impressed by what the developer managed to do with it.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. For the nerds: according to a social media <a href="https://x.com/h3r2tic/status/1838251514168574026" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the developer it uses Rust and Vulkan.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-14 brings fixes for Star Citizen, God of War Ragnarök and other games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 9-14 has been released bringing in more game fixes for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, for those who need the extras.</p>
<p>As your reminder: it's a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>This release pulls in a change for God of War Ragnarök, specifically for Desktop Linux users, so you'll no longer need the launch option to pretend you're running a Steam Deck. Plus a few other game-specific fixes, and the usual updates from all the upstream projects like DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, Wine and others.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-14" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>Update dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi to latest git</li>
<li>Import upstream proton changes</li>
<li>Update mono to 9.3.0</li>
<li>Rebase wine-staging</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added god of war ragnarok SteamDeck=1 workaround (thanks UserNamesAreNotMyThing)</li>
<li>Added Star Citizen libcuda nvidia fix (thanks ProjectSynchro)</li>
<li>Added fix for Plain Site (thanks iodream)</li>
<li>Added fix for Worms: Blast (thanks iodream)</li>
<li>Remove deprecated Sleeping Dogs: DE fix</li>
<li>winetricks now built from source</li>
<li>Elden Ring fix updated (thanks UserNamesAreNotMyThing)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.15 Beta: Zoomer Edition released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<ul>
<li>Updated to a more recent Arch Linux base and updated KDE Plasma desktop mode.</li>
<li>Improved session recovery speed after GPU crashes.</li>
<li>Enabled support for Bluetooth A2DP and BAP profiles.</li>
<li>Improved display uniformity, under some conditions (Mura Compensation).</li>
<li>support for some HDMI CEC features in the Deck Dock.</li>
<li>BIOS overclocking controls on Steam Deck LCD.</li>
<li>+ much more.</li>

      <title>Frog Protocols announced to try and speed up Wayland protocol development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One day, Wayland will truly take over the Linux world, but it's not quite there yet with plenty still using X11 due to various problems some of which the new Frog Protocols aim to solve.</p>
<p>Announced by <em>misyl</em>, who does various work for Valve (like Gamescope), it certainly sounds like a good idea to give Wayland Protocols a swift kick to get into gear to improve things for users. Writing on their <a href="https://idtech.space/notice/AmJ60Dc5Vn0yigcxPM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayland Protocols has long had a problem with new protocols sitting for months, to years at a time for even basic functionality.</p>
<p>This is hugely problematic when some protocols implement very primitive and basic functionality such as frog-fifo-v1, which is needed for VSync to not cause GPU starvation under Wayland and also fix the dreaded application freezing when windows are occluded with FIFO/VSync enabled.</p>
<p>We need to get protocols into end-users hands quicker! The main reason many users are still using X11 is because of missing functionality that we can be shipping today, but is blocked for one reason or another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can learn more on the <a href="https://github.com/misyltoad/frog-protocols" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and see the open Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31329/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to hopefully get the frog-fifo-v1 protocol into upstream Mesa drivers.</p>
<p>Looking at the Merge Request, it's explained that SteamOS (Steam Deck) and Gamescope are already "shipping essentially this functionality" since version 3.5 as it's a "serious and genuine problem".</p>
<p>There's already a little bit of push-back from one developer Simon Ser who <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31329/#note_2580654" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think adding support for protocols essentially bypassing the wayland-protocols consensus is a good idea. The bar in wayland-protocols is not that high, and adding support for third-party protocols not representative of the Wayland community isn't a good way forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which had a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/31329/#note_2580740" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reply</a> from Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is value in rapid iteration that the current development model is missing out on. If this would be better as an ext hosted on the upstream wayland-protocols repo, that seems fine to me as well, but I'm not sure that there needs to be a bar at all for an ext protocol other than being available for whoever wants to use it. On the contrary, reducing friction there would provide invaluable experimental feedback to the upstream development effort, and serve users during those long development cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting times, but it's good that something is being done to hopefully kick things up a notch and improve things, especially when it comes to gaming, for the rest of us.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform remote play app for PlayStation adds controller mapping, custom renderer options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have a PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4 and want to stream games to something else like your PC or Steam Deck, chiaki-ng is what you need and it just got a great upgrade in version 1.9.0.</p>
<p>Originally called chiaki4deck where it vastly improved Steam Deck support over the original chiaki open source project, it was later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/playstation-remote-play-app-gets-renamed-to-chiaki-ng-chiaki-next-generation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">renamed</a> to chiaki-ng (chiaki-next-generation) to better showcase that it's for all platforms.</p>
<p>The new v1.9.0 release brings with it some big new features like a feature to allow you to fully configure the mapping for your controller, which they say is "especially nice for mapping Xbox and Switch controllers to PlayStation inputs". You also now get more control over how the stream displays with custom option support.</p>
<p>All the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>adds <strong>Controllers</strong> section to chiaki-ng settings which allows you to configure the mapping for your controller (especially nice for mapping Xbox and Switch controllers to PlayStation inputs) [Note: Controllers mapped via Steam should be mapped directly in the Steam UI gamepad configurator as opposed to this menu. If you try to map a controller that is mapped via Steam in this menu it will give you a notification that it should be mapped via Steam.]</li>
<li>adds Custom renderer option which allows you to configure your renderer options very granularly with the options at <a href="https://libplacebo.org/options/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://libplacebo.org/options/</a></li>
<li>add defaults to all settings so users are aware of the defaults/which settings they've changed</li>
<li>add different haptic rumble intensity settings for users to configure if the default is not to their liking</li>
<li>add ability to hide un-registered discovered consoles</li>
<li>for manual connection show 1 pane with all relevant information instead of 2 panes when console is discovered + allow user to choose between registered consoles (regardless of whether or not they are currently discovered) + make PS5 default console type</li>
<li>disable double click for fullscreen by default and allow re-enabling via the <strong>Video</strong> section of the Settings</li>
<li>fix crash when user has more than 1 PS5 registered with PSN</li>
<li>fix crash that could happen when a user uses the wake from sleep feature</li>
<li>fix corrupt stream that could occur after several hours of streaming</li>
<li>fix launching from a path with non-ascii characters on Windows</li>
<li>fix decimal points turning into scientific notation numbers in QSliders</li>
<li>properly terminate ipv6 discovery service</li>
<li>ping all network interfaces on Linux and MacOS allowing discovery of previously undiscovered consoles</li>
</ul>

      <title>Popular FPS Fallen Aces gets Steam Deck support in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fallen Aces from Trey Powell, Jason Bond and New Blood Interactive quickly became popular after the initial Early Access release in June and now it has Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Valve initially rated the game as Unsupported, due to various problems from performance to crashes. Thankfully it should be all good now. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1411910/view/4687773573358770867" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam with the amusing "GET YOUR DECKS OUT" update with the main improvements including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck compatibility and massive performance improvements.</li>
<li>Additional options for Dynamic Shadows, now defaults to low.</li>
<li>Added ability to skip cutscenes and game start-up movies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also numerous bug fixes.</p>
<p>Latest major update video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pW4gxuetKwg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ec45949ce18e8c28f13311cf2622478.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pW4gxuetKwg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Well, I know what I'm going to be playing through soon then! Can't wait to punch a shark and see whatever craziness you can do in the game.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1411910/Fallen_Aces/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Sega Saturn styled racer Parking Garage Rally Circuit is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving on Steam with Linux support is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, an indie racing game from Walaber Entertainment designed like a long lost Sega Saturn game. It certainly looks the part too, so for those of you who enjoy something a little more nostalgic but with modern touches this is for you.</p>
<p>Seems Steam players are enjoying it too with it getting a quick Very Positive rating.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lcxRmvn8KXY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ed0fa1ee4af04797f6541af58162acc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lcxRmvn8KXY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As the developer explains the gameplay: "This is a hybrid of Rally and circuit racing. From rally it draws the jumps and “one racer at a time against the clock” time-trial format. However, the tracks are similar to circuit racing, with each race consisting of multiple laps around the same track (the track may change slightly from lap to lap, however) Controls are very tight, simple and arcadey, similar to Mario Kart (accelerate, reverse, steer, drift), but with a bit more dynamic “smash into things” physics."</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. No Steam Deck rating yet but should run great.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CoreCtrl adds power profiles support for AMD RX 7600</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Depending on what you have in your system it will look a bit like this:</p>

      <title>Just a To the Moon Series Beach Episode from Freebird Games is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One new release missed from last week, with Freebird Games launching Just a To the Moon Series Beach Episode. The latest in their popular series of story-rich 2D pixel-art adventure games, and like their previous it comes with Native Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12558914631727084383gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As usual, the description the developer gives is not exactly clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beach Episode(TM) of To the Moon, Finding Paradise, and Impostor Factory.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Or is it?</em><br/>
<br/>
...Yes, it technically is. <em>Just A To the Moon Series Beach Episode</em> is just that: A To the Moon series beach episode.<br/>
<br/>
Get ready for a new short adventure as the SigCorp. crew takes off to an all-expenses-paid vacation at the Golden Lobster Hotel &amp; Resort! For a grand total of 1 day, which is apparently the most the company was willing to fork out. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<br/>
Join familiar faces from <em>To the Moon, Finding Paradise, </em>and <em>Impostor Factory</em> in this narrative adventure filled with mini-games of varying elements, mysteries and relaxation, as well as--<br/>
<br/>
Wait, most of the characters here should already be dead.....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers say it's about 2-3 hours long, and they said clearly not to exit during the credits, so there's probably some sort of surprise there.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's not technically the end either. They said confusingly it's "half of an ending". More is to come, sort-of, with their next planned game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2664600/The_Last_Hour_of_an_Epic_TO_THE_MOON_RPG/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Last Hour of an Epic TO THE MOON RPG</a> that will release at some point (no dates mentioned).</p>
<p>You can buy Just a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2159210/Just_a_To_the_Moon_Series_Beach_Episode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">To the Moon Series Beach Episode on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>That's not a complete list, as the developers mentioned they're "still learning what new games work as users test games and report their findings, so this list will get bigger as we receive new reports". The <a href="https://github.com/RipleyTom/rpcn/releases/tag/1.3.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for RPCN 1.3 mention various other fixes too.</p>
<p>Nice to see more features of games saved from oblivion thanks to emulation and open source projects.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's Steam just seem to be unstoppable lately, with another huge user milestone achieved over the weekend.</p>
<p>For the first time, the concurrent user count managed to rise over 38 million! 38,367,277 to be exact, according to the numbers on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. At the time 12,270,218 players were actually in-game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going over the data at the time these were the most-played games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>PUBG: Battlegrounds</li>

<p class="plain-list-title">Looking back over the history of Steam breaking user counts, it's clear that 2024 has been an insane year for the growth of Steam overall. This makes the 5th time just this year that the online count has been shattered and smashed through:</p>

      <title>Valve appear to be testing ARM64 and Android support for Steam on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve appear to have some pretty ambitious future plans for Steam, as we've seen recently in a leak (and not for the first time) that Valve has plans for ARM64 and Android support on Linux.</p>
<p>As usual, the leaks come thanks to SteamDB, which scrapes everything possible related to Steam. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3043620/history/?changeid=25321568" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest "ValveTestApp3043620"</a> appears to show various VR <em>and</em> standard non-VR games being tested on ARM64 with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> (the Windows to Linux compatibility layer). When you scroll down the list it shows this is thanks to an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX</a>, which "allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on an AArch64 host". It also mentions <a href="https://github.com/waydroid/waydroid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Waydroid</a>, an open source container system that allows you to run Android apps and games on a Linux-based system.</p>
<p>Before people think it's about any Windows and macOS stuff here, it seems <em>very</em> specific to Linux. The configuration text mentions how it's <em>from</em> Windows <em>to</em> Linux.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought this would have been purely for the long-rumoured "Deckard" VR headset, which I believe based on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/deckard-is-apparently-the-codename-for-a-possible-standalone-valve-vr-headset/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous</a> leaks will have a standalone mode that runs Linux (with an Arm processor) as well as being able to be hooked up to a PC. So it would make a <em>lot</em> of sense for Valve to be working on a system like this to extend Proton support to ARM64 <em>and</em> get Android-based apps / games working as well.</p>
<p>However, since the list included a lot of standard non-VR games too, it does beg the question: might we actually see Steam for Arm-based desktop devices too and not just whatever the new VR headset turns out to be? Definitely interesting times ahead. Valve's funding of various Linux-related open source projects will continue to pay off in the long run with the Steam Deck and whatever comes next.</p>
<p>Scrolling through the list it showed Valve testing compatibility for the likes of Pistol Whip (VR), Gorilla Tag (VR), Left 4 Dead 2, Garry's Mod, Shadow of Mordor and a great many more including various smaller indie games too.</p>
<p>Thinking back to how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer was announced originally</a>, it confirmed a long-held suspicion by many that the DXVK project was being funded by Valve to get the Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D into a good state. So who knows, perhaps Valve are doing similar funding for FEX and Waydroid developers well ahead of any announcements again.</p>
<p>Valve later wiped it (but SteamDB shows the history) and put it behind a protected token, so that SteamDB can't scrape it again in future until they set whatever it is live. Bit of a woops by Valve there, but this sort of thing has happened quite a few times in the past.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.14 Beta released with a Flatpak security fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small update to SteamOS 3.6 Beta for Steam Deck, bringing two small but important fixes as we're firmly on the road to the stable release.</p>
<p>Here's the changes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4676514574287490300" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.14</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Security fix for Flatpak (CVE-2024-42472).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed nested desktop crashing on launch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking up the Flatpak security issue: Prior to versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.10, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could access and write files outside of what it would otherwise have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality. It's been fixed in Flatpak 1.14.10 and Flatpak 1.15.10.</p>
<p>You can read more about the issue on <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7hgv-f2j8-xw87" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> that was reported back in early August by Collabora engineer Simon McVittie.</p>

      <title>GTA V / GTAOnline highlights Steam Deck&#39;s verification system has problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, we had the news that Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated Grand Theft Auto V to include BattlEye anti-cheat</a>, and they have <em>not</em> enabled the Linux / Proton support that BattlEye offers. With that change, the online mode is now broken for Linux / Steam Deck. This just highlights an ongoing problem with the Steam Deck verification system.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V <em>was</em> rated as Steam Deck Playable by Valve. It would have actually been fully Steam Deck Verified if two issues were solved: the launcher being a nuisance, and setting the correct resolution by default. It even had a special Steam Deck Most Played banner on the Steam store page, because it was constantly in the top most played list every month. In this case, since it’s such a high-profile title, Valve did at least react quite quickly to change the Steam page to note it’s Unsupported a day later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11133295951726852983gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - How the Steam page looked until September 18th</em></p>
<p>Therein lies the problem. Steam Deck Verified is <em>all</em> Valve, it’s nothing to do with the original developers of the games that are being checked.</p>
<p>Developers cannot opt out of it (as far as we’ve been told so far) with the ratings getting automatically published after a while. Some developers, to their credit, are updating their games for Steam Deck support, it’s something we cover here on GamingOnLinux almost every day.</p>
<p>What this means though in reality is that even with a Steam Deck badge of approval, you’re technically buying a game on an <em>unsupported</em> platform, unless the developers themselves are clearly saying it’s supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20189621021726853100gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20189621021726853100gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Valve's new Steam Deck Unsupported status for GTA V</em></p>
<p>So with that in mind, even if developers are giving zero support for Linux-based platforms, they’re still going to end up with a verification badge of some sort with people buying them and playing them. That is, unless they specifically block Linux / Steam Deck, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-say-a-big-fat-no-to-proton-and-steam-deck-for-destiny-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bungie does with Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The thing is though, when you think about how it's being sold, the "blame" (if we wish to use that word) is on part both on Valve and Rockstar here. Valve for putting up the rating when the developer isn't giving it any support, and Rockstar for not blocking it and just taking the purchases. Rockstar would have been well aware it got given a rating.</p>
<p>GTAV is far from the first example of its kind. Looking back on it we’ve also had issues with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Battlefield 1 went from Steam Deck Playable to Unsupported, due to EA anticheat.</li>
<li>Battlefield V went from Steam Deck Playable to Unsupported, due to EA anticheat.</li>
<li>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2: Deluxe Edition went from Steam Deck Playable to Unsupported, due to EA anticheat.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Before people bring them up in the comments: Battlefield 2042 is also broken, but it never worked to begin with, as even when it had Easy Anti-Cheat (that supports Linux platforms) it was never enabled. Now it has EA anticheat too. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA SPORTS WRC</a> is similar, it was rated Unsupported but it <em>did</em> actually work and <em>now</em> it doesn’t due to EA anticheat. So while these two aren’t part of this specific topic right now, they do continue to highlight the <em>ongoing</em> anti-cheat issue.</p>
<p>And while Apex Legends works <em>currently</em>, there’s been repeating issues when the anti-cheat has been broken following updates, and a couple of times where Steam Deck / Linux players got banned and had to wait to be unbanned due to false flags there. Eventually, Apex Legends may even end up swapping from the Linux-supported Easy Anti-Cheat to EA anticheat like other EA published titles and break as well.</p>
<p>Single-player games largely aren’t a problem, although some have poor performance and yet <em>somehow</em> still get a Playable or Verified rating, which Valve do seem to be a bit inconsistent on.</p>
<p>To highlight the above a bit more. There’s a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3186865924592128220/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pinned post</a> in the official Steam Deck forum for people to report errors with the Steam Deck Verified program. That post has now accrued 1,060 replies with a big mixture of complaints about Verified games from poor overall performance, to the games completely crashing the Steam Deck system, some have completely broken textures, various videos not playing and the list goes on. It also shows a few posts talking about games that clearly deserve a <em>higher</em> rating than what Valve gave. So it's not just about broken games, but games that people see zero issues with rated incorrectly by Valve too.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s not to say the whole idea of Steam Deck Verified is <em>broken</em>, but in many cases, Valve <em>definitely</em> need to work more closely with developers rather than just sticking up a rating and calling it done. This is <em>especially</em> true for games that have online multiplayer, or if it’s the only mode the game has. I don't have any good solution in mind though, Valve obviously have people a lot smarter than me working on all this, but <em>something</em> should be done to prevent such negative headline-grabbing issues in future for the Steam Deck as a gaming platform. I obviously want to see it succeed probably more than most people.</p>
<p>You may at this point be thinking, but hey I read a fancy article recently that said Microsoft are banning kernel-level anti-cheat, so this will be all solved right? Well, no. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux has an article going over that</a> for you to read. In short: Microsoft have not said they’re doing so, just making a “new” platform for security. And <em>again</em>, developers can and <em>do</em> block Linux regardless of having kernel-level tomfoolery or not (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hi again Roblox</a>).</p>
<p>If Valve do ever plan to launch a Steam Deck 2, they’re going to need to overhaul the rating system anyway right? So, now is the time to get Steam Deck Verified tweaked and improved before more issues come up with a second-generation, and before more titles end up having to go from Playable or Verified to Unsupported because the developer wasn’t supporting it at all to begin with, as Rockstar have made plainly clear with their <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> entry for GTA V.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not into GTA V or any other title that’s been broken and don’t care: you really should. Each game being broken is a loss for overall support of the platform as a whole. It’s not a good look and it reduces choice for gamers.</p>
<p>I emailed Valve to talk about this issue with the verified program and they have not replied yet.</p>
<p>Before some comments come along to try and wriggle this into a “Native Linux is better” type of argument, that’s just <em>nonsense</em>. We’ve seen numerous games remove their Native Linux builds completely, or drop support for them, heck I wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/last-epoch-drops-the-native-linux-version-devs-tell-players-to-use-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one such case earlier today</a>. Native vs Proton is not the issue, platform <u><em>support</em></u> is, regardless of how the games are made to work.</p>
<p>On another note, while we’re on the subject of Steam Deck gaming, Proton and the rating system. Given how far <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve’s Proton</a> has come to where it now runs tens of thousands of Windows games without a fuss, perhaps it’s finally time for Valve to allow developers to <em>officially</em> list their games as supported via Proton for Linux-based platforms (regardless of Desktop Linux or Steam Deck). I did also email Valve to enquire about that back in <em>August</em>, and did not receive a reply.</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments: what are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>God of War Ragnarök released and Steam Deck Verified, needs a launch option for Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>God of War Ragnarök from Santa Monica Studio, Jetpack Interactive and PlayStation Publishing LLC has released on PC today and Valve put it quickly through verification for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While writing this article it was initially only noted via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2322010/history/?changeid=25320559" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, but checking back before publishing and the status is now live on the Steam page too. So it's fully Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3 that was also released recently</a>. Once again, Valve and their coders doing some amazing work to get AAA games working at release on Linux platforms like Steam Deck and desktops.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2255394591726850558gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game does require a PlayStation Network Account, so some regions will be unable to buy or play it. People were worried that the PlayStation Overlay, which is used in Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT and causes the online mode not to work, would be forced here again but it seems that's <em>not</em> the case.</p>
<p>However, this seems due to the developers putting in a hook to detect the Steam Deck, and simply not use the overlay if so. What this means is that for Desktop Linux players, you'll need to add this Steam launch option to pretend it's a Steam Deck to get it work:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>You can add this via right clicking on the game -&gt; properties -&gt; add it into the Launch Options text box.</p>
<p>This appears to come with some mouse issues though, so you'll need a gamepad for now, as mentioned in comments on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a> for it. You also might need to link your PlayStation and Steam accounts first to get it to work.</p>
<p>I'll admit, this one snuck-up on me and I forgot it was coming today, so I've not had a chance to take a look. I really hope though, that it runs better than the previous God of War game that had frequent Steam Deck lock-up crashes while also being Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Pocketpair respond to the Nintendo and Pokemon Company lawsuit for Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair, developers of Palworld, have put up a statement on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new lawsuit</a> that has been filed against them from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.<br/>
<br/>
We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.<br/>
<br/>
Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.<br/>
<br/>
As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>When it comes to what patent infringement Nintendo / Pokemon could be going after Pocketpair for, well, Nintendo actually have quite a number of patents that are for some very specific game mechanics. Which <em>could</em> be <em>really</em> problematic not just for Pocketpair, but all game developers looking to do anything similar.</p>
<p>Take for example <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7398425B2/en?oq=JP7398425B2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this patent</a> (approved in Japan, pending in the USA), that covers the feature of capturing creatures by throwing an object and sending out a character (like a Pokemon) to engage in combat. </p>
<p>Remember, this is not about copyright infringement, so they're not specifically going after any of the creature designs, but it's about the patents.</p>
<p>This is going to be a legal fight to remember. One perhaps for the history books.</p>
