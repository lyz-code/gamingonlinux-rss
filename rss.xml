      <title>I&#39;m far too excited about Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is an upcoming mini expansion for the popular action-platformer metroidvania game from Motion Twin / Evil Empire coming early this year.</p>
<p>It was originally announced at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/lots-of-good-stuff-announced-at-the-game-awards-2022-m-roundup/" target="_blank">The Game Awards 2022</a> which I covered in my big round-up and now the developer is teasing it more again.</p>
<p>As ridiculously brief as the teaser is, I can't help but feel terribly excited about it. Truthfully, I wasn't even a Castlevania fan until very recently, I never really played the older games and wasn't until watching the truly incredible Castlevania Anime on Netflix that I felt pulled into the world. You really should watch it, truly excellent.</p>
<p>The new teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q10fKa_MkW0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5be2be69380d5b4076d36b8e0025a24f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q10fKa_MkW0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What the DLC will come with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Weapons: </strong>Unlock 14 iconic weapons such as the Vampire Killer, Throwing Axe &amp; Holy Water to decimate Dracula's bestiary of monsters and finally the dark lord himself. Each item has been translated into the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells while keeping their original essence.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Dracula's Castle: </strong>Secret rooms. Flame-lit corridors. Gloomy tombs. Beautiful paintings. Food hidden in the walls. Full of original monsters from the series, such as harpies, werewolves &amp; haunted armors, the character of the iconic castle will transport you into the realms of gothic fantasy.</li>
<li><strong>Classic and Reimagined Music: </strong>We're giving you access to an alternative soundtrack made of 51 of the original Castlevania tunes, that can be heard across the entire game. Yes, 51! On top of this, we've taken the 12 most iconic tracks, such as Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears and Simon Belmont's Theme, and reimagined them in the style of Dead Cells as a soundtrack for this DLC, while preserving the Castlevania ambiance of course.</li>
<li><strong>A New Story:  </strong>Richter Belmont and Alucard will be by your side throughout your quest to vanquish Dracula, helping you to navigate the maze of Dracula’s Castle and providing you with strong weapons (sometimes willingly, sometimes not). However, where there is good there is evil, so watch out for powerful foes who will try everything in their power to stop you from reaching the throne room.</li>
<li><font color="#e0e0e0"><strong>Three Boss Fights: </strong></font>Fight against the very essence of evil in two intense duels versus Death and Dracula, both set against a majestic backdrop. If you can survive these gauntlets, prepare yourself for our most ambitious boss showdown yet...</li>
<li><strong>Castlevania Outfits: </strong>Unlock 20 outfits as you progress through the castle, letting you roleplay as all your favourite characters like Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades or even Dracula himself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>With Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, you're in for a good time even before this DLC release.</p>

      <title>An interview with the creator of the Heroic Games Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested to learn a little about the people who make cool open source programs? Today I have interview with Flávio, the creator of the popular <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> used on Linux desktop, Steam Deck, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Q: First of all can you introduce yourself</strong></p>
<p>"Hi! My name is Flávio, I am a developer originally from Brazil but moved to Sweden 4 years ago. Father of 2 kids and passionate about tech, open source, gaming, history and heavy metal."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started with programming?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, I started working on IT in general when I was 16 and at that time I started to experiment with web development. Professionally I started to work as a developer around 7 or 8 years ago. Web and Android development."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us about the Heroic Games Launcher, what is it and why did you make it?</strong></p>
<p>"Heroic is an open source games launcher, it supports downloading, installing and playing games from Epic and GOG stores.  It is available for Linux, Windows and macOS. Behind the curtains it uses the great tool called Legendary to deal with the Epic games and our in house solution called GOGDL to deal with the GOG games.</p>
<p>Besides that, it is also possible to add your own games using what we call ‘Sideload’ feature, so since a couple of releases ago you can use Heroic even if you do not have an Epic or GOG account.</p>
<p>I use Linux since 2007 and always used it to play some games. But since Valve has developed Proton and DXVK and VKD3D started to be a thing, I migrated 100% to play on Linux, since almost all my library was playable on it and it is the system I also use for everything else.</p>
<p>When Epic started to give free games was when I discovered Legendary and started using it to play those games on Linux. One example of a game that I finished at the time using it was Control, that was Epic exclusive for a while and I really wanted to play it.</p>
<p>So since Legendary is a CLI tool and no GUIs were available for it at the time, I saw a good opportunity to contribute to the open source community and started to think on how I could develop a GUI for it with the developer stack I am used to.</p>
<p>I wrote a post on the linux gaming community on reddit to see first if people were interested in that and I got more than 300 comments and people were really excited for that.</p>
<p>A couple of days after the post I released the first version with basic features.</p>
<p>Then I asked my wife to help me with the UI/UX (she is a designer) and she did some research on the gaming community about the launchers we have on Linux and based on that feedback she started to make the design for it and we started to improve based on the feedback we were receiving as well."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8234942081674222543gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8234942081674222543gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: Has anyone from Epic Games or GOG reached out to you about the Heroic Games Launcher at all?</strong></p>
<p>"No, so far no one has reached us about it."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How difficult is it to support these stores that don’t support Linux directly with a launcher? What problems do you face?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, first is the lack of documentation. Since they do not have an open API, both Legendary and GOGDL are reverse engineering them to make the basic stuff. Some things for GOG are still not available, some Galaxy features for instance. But Linguin (one of our devs) is putting a lot of effort into improving this part and supporting GOG was a huge milestone for the project. And in parallel he is also developing Nile, a CLI tool for Amazon games that we will implement a frontend in Heroic pretty soon."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Heroic has been out for a while now, how have you found the reception to it? How’s things going overall?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, we know that a lot of people really dislike Epic Games and part of that is related to some comments from their CEO about Linux.</p>
<p>In general the reception was always good and several people came to give me thanks for the project and how it was making their gaming life more productive on Linux.</p>
<p>But there were some people that were saying that I should not waste my time on that, that I should do other stuff. Or they were complaining that it was an Electron App and I should write it in another framework or language.</p>
<p>Bottom line, deciding to stick with Electron was the best decision I made for the project, since it makes it a lot easier to distribute the app and that is why we have AppImage, Flatpaks, debs, RPMs and also why was somehow simple to distribute it on Windows and macOS as well.</p>
<p>Some people come to me from time to time saying that they discovered that it was possible to game on Linux because they were using Heroic on Windows and saw that there was a Linux version. So this made them experiment and even migrate to Linux because of that and I think this is pretty cool."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you think people should use Heroic over Lutris, or Bottles or *insert other app*? Do you see them as competition, or is it more like companions?</strong></p>
<p>"I have a lot to thank Lutris and also PlayOnLinux for making my life a lot easier to play games on when this was a pretty hard task and we did not have Proton, etc. Lutris was definitely an inspiration for Heroic and still is. </p>
<p>We have a great relationship with the developers of Bottles and Lutris and they help us when we need and vice-versa. The way I see it is that we are united for the same cause, that is to make gaming on Linux easier and accessible for everyone, especially newcomers. </p>
<p>Sometimes some games won’t work on Heroic and they work fine on Lutris or on Bottles and the other way around so having alternatives is great and that is the best thing of the Open Source community.</p>
<p>So, cheers to all of them! :)"</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started with Linux and what’s your favourite distribution and why?</strong></p>
<p>"I started with Linux in 2007, my first experience was not that good, it was with Fedora 6 or 7 I guess and GNOME at that time was not really welcoming so I hated it.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, a friend of mine showed me a Brazilian distro called Kurumin that came with KDE3 and had several scripts and automations for everything. We need to remember that at that time even to use a CD or USB drive you needed to mount it manually on the terminal, so having these automations and scripts was great. So then I started to use it and love it.</p>
<p>Nowdays I don’t have a favourite distribution. The ones I used the most were OpenSuse (around 2 years), Slackware and Gentoo for around 1 year each and then Manjaro for I guess almost 4 years until I discovered Garuda that is my distro of choice today. Although I want to experiment with Vanilla OS now from my friend Mirko from the Bottles team. I basically only hear great things about it.</p>
<p>The thing is that I don’t really have time to setup things from scratch so I like to use distros that does most of the work for me and I just need to configure basic things for my workflow."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your opinion on the Steam Deck? Valve sent the developer Lutris a Steam Deck, did you ever hear anything from Valve on a bit of support to help you?</strong></p>
<p>"Steam Deck is basically the best thing in Linux gaming since forever I would say. The amount of work that Valve did on it and making all this progress available for the Linux community is amazing. It is a great piece of hardware and it’s software is only getting better.</p>
<p>Valve never got in touch to send a Deck to us but we were able to buy one with donations from our community that I think it is great. </p>
<p>I think makes sense that Valve sent one to the Lutris team due to the importance and longevity of the project."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are your favourite games? Give us your top 5!</strong></p>
<p>"Oh, that is a really hard question because I play games since I was 6 and I play on console as well.</p>
<p>I will probably forget some but If I need to get 5 games that I had a pretty good time those would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Castlevania SOTN</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 3</li>
<li>Bloodborne</li>
<li>NieR: Automata</li>
<li>The Witcher 3"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: If someone wanted to help with development on the Heroic Games Launcher, what are you looking for? How can they get involved?</strong></p>
<p>"There are several ways of helping with Heroic development, even if you are not a developer you can help with translations on our Weblate project.</p>
<p>Developers should first be nice people, I have to say that I consider myself pretty lucky because our team today is pretty nice and we work pretty good together and they made a lot for the project.</p>
<p>Our stack is basically NodeJS, Typescript, CSS/SASS and ReactJS.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher" target="_blank">our GitHub</a> we have issues and feature requests with a label called ‘Good-First-Issue’ that is where people can start to understand how the code works and so on.</p>
<p>We have opportunities for all levels of developers from students until seniors and Heroic is a great way to put something on your CV. We have even created a Heroic Organization on </p>
<p>Linkedin so people can add their contributions and link to our official page there. This is good if you are searching for work to show their skillset.</p>
<p>If you develop with Python you can also get involved on GOGDL or even Legendary as well.</p>
<p>So if you want to contribute, just go to our Discord community and get in touch with us :)"</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most excited about for the future of Linux gaming as a whole?</strong></p>
<p>"I am pretty excited about that because gaming on Linux today is totally proven and I believe this year will get even better. I mean, if the Steam Deck made Ubisoft add <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat support for Linux on The Division 2</a>, I really can only expect things will get even better from now on.</p>
<p>I think 2023 will be simply great for us and we will have more and more support from big publishers."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there anything you would really love to add to the Heroic Games Launcher, that’s just perhaps out of reach right now?</strong></p>
<p>"I think there are several things that could (and perhaps will) be added to Heroic in the future. We plan on adding more stores of course, Amazon, maybe Itch.io and others. We also are planning a way of automating fixes like Proton does with Protonfixes by using a database of what we call ‘workarounds’. We are also working on a new design for Heroic to make it more modern but also with a better UX in general.</p>
<p>I would like to have is a native support for EA and Ubisoft games because their official launchers simply sucks, not only on Linux, but on Windows they are terrible as well. We have started to investigate and look into them, so might be possible in the future but definitely not an easy task."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Big thank you to Flávio for taking the time to have a chat and answer my questions.</p>

      <title>New Steam desktop and Steam Deck Betas fixes up Big Picture Mode, Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put up another Beta update for the Steam client on Desktop and Steam Deck with plenty of fixes. Here's all the details.</p>
<p>Since the two largely share the code now, the changelog across both (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659771788271315337" target="_blank">Desktop</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3635001990319736151" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>) is basically the same. Here's the patch notes that should apply to both:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed background images on a collection on the app details page not being clipped correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the Remove Collection dialog was not appearing.</li>
<li>Added icons for VR support or Mouse &amp; KB only support to app portraits.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect focus shifting away from the BPM window faster and reduce instances of navigation going to BPM after starting a game.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam mini window not closing when entering Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where setting certain library filters in Big Picture Mode could cause those games to become hidden. when switching back to desktop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle errors better and fix some cases where configs would no longer load.</li>
<li>On larger screens combine the keyboard and numpad tabs of the choose binding screen.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where some languages could have text overflow in choose binding screen.</li>
<li>Remember the last active tab in the choose binding screen and open to that instead always using the tab w/ the current binding value.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is Steam Deck Specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed non-Steam apps becoming unresponsive to gamepad when onscreen keyboard is opened.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This on is Desktop specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Big Picture window being incorrect size when moving it to a different display with win+shift+arrow key.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Here we go again though: Valve noting details for Steam Deck on things just don't exist. I've pointed this out a few times like with the gamepad icon, and new controller settings in previous Betas that aren't on Steam Deck and they're doing it again now. The mouse / keyboard and VR icons they noted in both patch notes do not exist on Steam Deck. I really don't get why they're not checking these before publishing as it's confusing to users. I've notified them across multiple places and they just don't see to be getting the message. <em>I seem to be the only one checking these things…</em></p>
<p>On desktop Big Picture Mode see the example with Half-Life: Alyx and Trombone Champ having the new icons:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14306742831674212487gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14306742831674212487gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The problem on Steam Deck is that where they're putting these icons is where the Deck Verified status is, and it wouldn't exactly make sense for the Steam Deck to even have a gamepad, keyboard / mouse or VR icon either as the Deck Verified status covers that. So it's a bit odd they keep detailing it in the Steam Deck patch notes. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">new controller options</a> still missing for idle time and turning off when exiting big picture mode is just odd though.</p>

      <title>Plasma 5.27 Beta live with Flatpak settings, multi-monitor upgrade, SteamOS updater</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go! The next version of KDE Plasma is <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.26.90/" target="_blank">now in Beta</a> and ready for wider testing, with some really great sounding changes. This is my favourite Linux desktop environment I use at home, plus it's the Desktop Mode on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>One of the big changes coming in Plasma 5.27 is the addition of Flatpak permission settings, so you'll no longer need another additional application (like Flatseal) to sort through what Flatpak packages can do. This is great, and has been needed for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18009430871674139011gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18009430871674139011gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Multi-monitor support should also be a lot better, as they've done a huge <a href="https://notmart.org/blog/2022/12/multi-screen/" target="_blank">overhaul</a> on it behind the scenes. While it should be mostly invisible to the end-user the changes involved were quite big and should result in no more empty desktops, you shouldn't see panels and widgets getting lost, a better experience with USB-C based docks (hello Steam Deckers) and so on.</p>
<p>This is probably what I am most excited about, as someone who uses Plasma for basically everything, it has been a nuisance at times with docking the Steam Deck and with it losing my second monitor on my desktop at times. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10952879611674139162gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10952879611674139162gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other changes coming include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More Flatpak improvements for Discover.</li>
<li>A SteamOS backend for performing Steam Deck updates in Discover.</li>
<li>Plasma Welcome - a new tool for users getting started using the desktop.</li>
<li>Upgrades to their Pipewire integration.</li>
<li>Lots more Wayland improvements.</li>
<li>Quick and easy window tiling.</li>
<li>Plus loads more fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

I'll go over what to expect on Steam Deck, and for Linux desktop listing either Native Linux status or ProtonDB rating (which goes Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze - Broken) to save you clicking around for info on each one.</p>
<p>Games included are:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Black Book</strong></p>

      <title>The Wandering Village gets gamepad and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, a very unique city-builder set on the back of a giant creature recently had a major update that added in gamepad support which also helps Steam Deck too. <em>I was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/the-wandering-village-is-absolutely-mesmerizing/" target="_blank">pretty big fan</a> of the initial release.</em></p>
<p>As of the update, Valve has given it a Steam Deck Playable rating using the Native Linux version, with it not being fully Verified due to some text being too small but as I show in the video below — there's really no problem at all with the text so Deck Verified once again being a mystery on the ratings.</p>
<p><em>Some of what's included in this update:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Gamepad Support (+ Steam Deck support)</li>
<li>New Autosave System</li>
<li>Worker Management Window to centrally manage employed workers</li>
<li>Disable Tool to more quickly disable and enable buildings</li>
<li>First set of Steam Achievements</li>
<li>New Buildings:
<ul>
<li>Granary, a larger food storage building</li>
<li>Onbu Discipliner, a building that, when used, hurts Onbu, but forces it to listen to your commands</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a little look at the gamepad support on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h9OmN2JM0vE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b5c60cc02bf47bf95eb0e1f9317b53f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h9OmN2JM0vE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a number of other improvements included in this update, like the harvesting tool not being used to remove Onbu's Spikes (the creature) causing it to not be happy with you. Something that kept tripping me up. There's also some visual fixes, edge-scrolling was added, buildings now have back doors for better villager pathing and so on.</p>

      <title>Hyper Gunsport saves the original from the closure of Stadia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hyper Gunsport released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663250/Hyper_Gunsport/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/hypergunsport" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with Native Linux support back in December 2022, and now the developer has sort-of rescued the original Stadia exclusive Gunsport with it.</p>
<p>What is it: at its core, Hyper Gunsport is a cooperatively competitive action game where the object is to shoot the ball into goals of varying difficulty, while the opposing team tries to do the same. Each time the ball crosses the net its point value goes up, so longer volleys mean bigger points and higher stakes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pem-VJqbb2E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85a055e73cd31dd5f679ead4715dfee4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pem-VJqbb2E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hyper Gunsport is basically an upgraded version of what the older Stadia exclusive was, the developers say "Hyper Gunsport is the sequel to the original Gunsport in the sense that Super Street Fighter II Turbo is the sequel to Street Fighter II".</p>
<p>Now, they've actually packaged up Gunsport itself into a Beta version you can try out on Steam, with some Stadia bits stripped out of it. As they said on <a href="https://twitter.com/necrosoftgames/status/1615439469674659840" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Stadia is shutting down tomorrow. This means all  exclusives, like the original Gunsport, will blink out of existence. But!! Since we care about game preservation we've made an offline version of Gunsport available in the Steam version of Hyper Gunsport, through the beta channel.", and they continued, "Anyone who bought Hyper Gunsport on Steam already has access to this if they want to compare and see the differences. It's offline, and has the Stadia trappings stripped out, but at least it exists! Select the beta and type OriginalGunsport to unlock it.".</p>
<p>Along with the Native Linux support, it's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton removes the dxvk-async patch in version 7-45</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's another release of the community-made compatibility layer GE-Proton with <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-45" target="_blank">version 7-45</a> out now, and this one removes a popular patch to help game performance but there's a good reason for that.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a> released, the software that does the Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 translation to Vulkan, it came with major changes to shader compilation. Thanks to pulling in support for the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library extension, it allows it to compile the shaders when games load their D3D shaders, rather than at draw time — the result is that games <em>should</em> perform better and reduce the stutter.</p>
<p><em>To work with it, you do need updated drivers with the recommended versions being 520.56.06 for NVIDIA and 22.2 for Mesa (AMD / Intel). AMD RADV users need to use "RADV_PERFTEST=gpl" to enable it.</em></p>
<p>So, with it mostly taking over the job of the old dxvk-async patch, GE-Proton has removed it. Another reason though, as pointed out in the release notes, is that dxvk-async causes <a href="https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/issues/55" target="_blank">problems</a> with the dxvk-cache and it seems the developer on dxvk-async no longer uses it either.</p>
<p>For those who still need it, for whatever reason, you can just use older versions of GE-Proton.</p>
<p>Need a primer on how to actually use GE-Proton? You can see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">my previous guide here</a> but to save you clicking around the video and steps are below:</p>

      <title>Ubisoft fixed The Division 2 on Steam Deck and Linux desktop </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's a nice surprise isn't it. Ubisoft did something good. They released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2221490/view/3632750190483497136" target="_blank">tiny patch</a>, that enabled Easy Anti-Cheat so The Division 2 now works on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>I've tested it on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop and yep — it works. Although, performance can be pretty <em>rough</em> due to the usual shader compiling issues on your first couple of runs while it stutters about quite fiercly. That <em>will</em> become smoother over time, and eventually (hopefully) Valve will have the shaders to send out with the game when it downloads like they do for others games. </p>
<p>Note: for Steam Deck players, <u>don't</u> turn on DirectX 12 as the game won't run. If you do, steps are noted in the video below on how to fix it sliced in between some gameplay clips I did earlier (timestamped). Text steps on the fix below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JNrs1QRa6Bc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dc1abacdd6621584970dc7089a589fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JNrs1QRa6Bc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Turn Off DirectX 12 fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Head to this location:
<ol>
<li><code class="inline-code">./steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/2221490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Tom Clancy's The Division 2/</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Edit the <code class="inline-code">state.cfg</code> file in a text editor, find where it says "dx12 = true" and change it to false.</li>
<li>Reload the game.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>With it now actually playable, I'm quite hopeful that Valve will have some tricks they can do in Proton to improve performance, on top of the shader stuff mentioned above. Now that it's working, at least they'll be able to investigate it to see if there's anything possibly.</p>
<p>If you find it actually doesn't still run for you, make sure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed from your Steam Library. Just search for it in Steam, it will be there to install. It's supposed to be automatic, but sometimes not.</p>
<p>Now if we could just get Destiny 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Rust and Dead By Daylight then I will have a lot less to complain about.</p>

      <title>Assemble Entertainment talk up their indie hits on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more publishers taking a direct interest in Steam Deck. Assemble Entertainment recently sent out an email to talk up their games on Valve's handheld. One of which, Endzone - A World Apart, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/endzone-a-world-apart-gets-upgraded-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">I just covered in an article and video</a>.</p>
<p>They're not the first to do this, with others like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/xbox-game-studios-talk-more-of-their-titles-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Xbox Game Studios</a> publishing their own details directly on Steam. I am surprised we haven't seen more of this though.</p>
<p>In the press release, it was noted that Assemble "is looking to provide an extensive catalogue of hidden gems and instant classics to those who want a great gaming experience on the go" and that "getting everything Steam Deck ready is still a work in progress" but they gave a shout-out to some existing titles.</p>
<p>Currently Steam Deck Verified:</p>

      <title>Endzone - A World Apart gets upgraded for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gentlymad Studios and Assemble Entertainment recently released an upgrade for Endzone - A World Apart, helping out anyone playing it on Steam Deck. This is part of a wider Steam Deck push from Assemble, that I'll be noting in an article to come.</p>
<p>For Endzone, their post-apocalyptic survival city builder, they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/933820/view/3648509051989294833" target="_blank">announced</a> that they've ported over the UI used on consoles for Steam Deck to give a better experience. Plus, they also adjusted performance and effects to make it work better on the hardware too. One trade-off is the text sizing, as they said "we had to compromise on text size for faster UI usability" that they claim won't harm the experience.</p>
<p>I decided to give it a test directly and capture a little of it that you can see below along with giving some thoughts:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q8WvJvPr3xA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13479a9f4ccf6114748fc2f8e016d52e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q8WvJvPr3xA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new UI is definitely looking good on Steam Deck, it feels like it was built for it. Text sizing as they said is still an issue though, the clarity is not amazing, made worse by how cramped the letter spacing looks with the font they're using but overall not too bad. Playable for sure.</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers optimise the Steam Deck experience. Would be good to see more over this over the next year, as text size especially is important for the Steam Deck. Small fonts are just no good.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/endzone-a-world-apart?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/933820/Endzone__A_World_Apart/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO confirm their Linux-based AYANEO OS arrives this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AYANEO, maker of some pretty popular gaming handhelds, announced that their own Linux operating system for their devices will be released this year. While we've seen others looking to the public release of SteamOS 3 that powers the Steam Deck (like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/" target="_blank">GPD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer</a>), AYANEO seem to want to "do a Valve" and have that extra level of control directly.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/AYANEO__/status/1615720358983921667" target="_blank">Twitter</a> their announcement was quite simple noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AYASpace will be upgrade and improved and also AYASpace 2 is under development which will be released in 2023 !<br/>
What's more,  new feature "Community" will be added to AYASpace APP.</p>
<p>Even more exciting, AYANEO OS goes live in 2023 as well 🥳<br/>
Expect official news announced soon ~</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5426039181674053406gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5426039181674053406gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20601100821674053408gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20601100821674053408gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>When they <a href="https://store.ayaneo.com/article/234" target="_blank">previously</a> talked about the Linux-based AYANEO OS, they said "AYANEO team loves games and game consoles as well. In the process of creating the best Windows handheld in the world, they found that the existing operating system in the new form of PC handheld still has many poor experiences, and even some problems that we can't be solved. In order to allow everyone to enjoy the game and the handheld hardware better, AYANEO has launched the AYANEO OS, which is based on the Linux system and developed exclusively." and they mentioned clearly they would be using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> too.</p>
<p>They recently finished their <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-2-completely-different-amd-6800u-handheld#/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding campaign for the AYANEO 2 and the GEEK model, both of which come with an AMD Ryzen 6800U. They had 2,680 people give over their monies to help fund them, with their IndieGoGo now switching to in-demand which is basically like another way to pre-order the devices. So while successful for AYANEO at $3,157,147 currently in total, it's an absolutely tiny fraction of what the Steam Deck has sold which was over a 1 million units back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">October last year</a> (that was even before launching in some Asian regions).</p>
<p>If I hear any more, I'll let you know.</p>
<p><em>2023 is clearly the year of Linux gaming handhelds huh?</em></p>

      <title>Circle of Kerzoven is an upcoming settlement builder with lots of simulation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Circle of Kerzoven appears to be one I missed that was pointed out in December last year, as an interesting looking settlement building game that simulates a whole lot of things you need to keep an eye on. <em>The developer of the game pointed it out on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/5511/" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Forum</a>.</em></p>
<p>"Take the role of a leader delegated to build new settlements in remote, unknown corners of the empire. In those forgotten places, nature is wild and legends are more real and vivid than one may think. Experience the challenges of different seasons and climates in a world, where every animal and every plant tries to find their place in nature, while you lead your villagers. How much will you share with nature? Will you strive for balance or even enforce the extinction of certain animals? Follow the old paths… or find your own."</p>
<p>You can see their early trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wrl6BASU938"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/596e34c86e6d160f12893c14281d4e31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wrl6BASU938" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence between humans and nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy, and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>Seasons and climate affect the gameplay, as certain plants grow only under certain conditions. Temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions that produce goods with the same rules as you do.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend them using mods.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733110/Circle_of_Kerzoven" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Stone Kingdoms is an in-development open source remake of Stronghold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anyone remember the original Stronghold from FireFly Studios? Well, there's an open source remake named Stone Kingdoms. Currently in-development and available on <a href="https://stonekingdoms.itch.io/stone-kingdoms-rts" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/stone-kingdoms/stone-kingdoms" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, the code is under the Apache 2.0 License but it also includes the artwork from the original game with permission from FireFly too (according to the developer of the project).</p>
<p>Developed with <a href="https://love2d.org/" target="_blank">LÖVE</a>, a framework for making 2D games with Lua.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18072956221674040046gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18072956221674040046gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now it seems it needs some more developers to jump in and help, with plenty missing from it, so it's not complete and playable. However, it does have enough done that you can load into the game into a map, and start building things so it's clearly off to a great start.</p>
<p>Looking forward to following this along, Stronghold would definitely be a fun game to have a complete open source game engine replacement for that would allow it to continue living on modern platforms long into the future.</p>

As a reminder: this version is not endorsed by Valve, and doesn't have all the testing that the official Proton does, and so sometimes new releases can come with issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>wine: updated to latest bleeding edge (includes alt+tab fix)</li>
<li>wine-staging: rebased for latest proton-wine bleeding edge</li>

      <title>Bluetooth support for the Stadia Controller is now live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google has put up a <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/" target="_blank">web-based tool</a> to turn on the Bluetooth mode for the Stadia Controller, as we finally say goodbye.</p>
<p>They say it works on Chrome 108 and above but when trying to work it on Fedora KDE, it just gives a message about currently being in use by another tab or program no matter what I tried. Even setting up the special udev rules they note in the FAQ, just nothing seemed to work. I had to dust off my old Windows install to do it, where it worked without problems there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732180721673984024gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732180721673984024gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The switch is <em>permanent</em>, and headphones won't work when plugged into the bottom of the controller when using Bluetooth mode. Tandem Mode will still work though, where you connect another controller to it but they both act like a single controller.</p>
<p>Once you've managed to enable Bluetooth, you can hold down Stadia + Y to start pairing and continue using it. I'm quite thankful it hasn't ended up as e-waste, because it's damn comfortable to hold. Easily still one of the nicest ever feeling controllers I've used.</p>
<p>Testing it briefly with my Steam Deck in the new Bluetooth mode — it works just fine connecting, and a quick game test showed it fine too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1187464781673984133gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1187464781673984133gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10780370381673984134gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10780370381673984134gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus, the biggest and most important thing to note: there's a time limit. You only have until 31st December 2023 to enable it. Quite a while and no doubt because they just want to shut down everything consumer-side for it and be finally rid of it. </p>

      <title>Stellaris: First Contact story pack announced focusing on pre-FTL and cloaking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellaris: First Contact is the next DLC for the space sci-fi strategy game from Paradox, with more of a focus on the early game. Sounds nice, because after quite a few games played, the early game does end up feeling a little stale.</p>
<p>It's all about expanding events for early civilisations with events and mechanics for pre-FTL civs across the stars, as well as new origins and most excitingly — cloaking tech. The thought of what I can do with that…it will also launch alongside a free update called "Canis Minor" providing something for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MjGQJBZBKxI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3679167d9bca9957b11784c8350e1947.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MjGQJBZBKxI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will actually include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Origins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Broken Shackles: You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?</li>
<li>Payback: No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own - until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!</li>
<li>Fear of the Dark: As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Pre-FTL Interaction Options</strong>: What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?</li>
<li><strong>Cloaking Technology</strong>: Nobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!</li>
</ul>

      <title>GameImage turns games, emulators and Wine into an AppImage - useful perhaps for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Formerly named Agape, <a href="https://gitlab.com/formigoni/gameimage" target="_blank">GameImage</a> is a way to package up games with either Wine or an Emulator into a portable AppImage that could be useful for the Steam Deck. <em>I could have sworn I wrote about this before, but apparently not. <u>Edit</u>: it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/winepak-a-project-to-get-windows-games-packaged-with-wine-flatpak-for-an-easy-linux-installation/" target="_blank">Winepak</a> I was thinking of previously.</em></p>
<p>As the developer on the project explains, emulation is popular and with the Steam Deck here people are doing a lot of it. However, configuration can be an issue, with files getting messed up or going missing and so GameImage aims to help with that as it packages up a runner (like an Emulator or Wine), a game and it's configuration files into a single AppImage.</p>
<p>Now, I should note, there's some obvious <em>legal</em> stuff around this that could cause issues with people sharing their creations with it that could contain full games. So it's of course something more for <em>personal</em> use. That, or you could share creations <em>without</em> the game perhaps for people who just want the configuration all set up and ready for you to slot your game files into after.</p>
<p>Another problem though is bloat. For the Steam Deck especially, drive space is always a concern. Every AppImage made with GameImage would contain duplicates of whatever emulator or Wine version being used, which is the point though, since it's all about being self-contained and easy to run anywhere be it a Steam Deck or desktop Linux. It does use squashfs, which will compress them to save a bit of room.</p>
<p><em>Interesting idea.</em></p>
<p>It currently supports RetroArch, PCSX2, RPCS3, yuzu and Wine. It also supports having a proper logo for each AppImage too, as the developed showed in their example:</p>

<p><em>What do you think about this tool? </em></p>

      <title>The Division 2 launched on Steam but no support of Steam Deck or Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another clear case of anti-cheat woes for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gaming, The Division 2 is another broken game. Ubisoft continue their shift back onto Steam, with Tom Clancy's The Division 2 launching January 12. If you were excited to give it a run on Steam Deck though, or a Linux desktop, you're completely out of luck right now. <strong>Update: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">a fix was released</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The Division 2 uses Easy Anti-Cheat, and while that tech does support Linux and Proton, Ubisoft have seemingly not enabled it. That, <em>or</em> there's other technical issues currently with Proton and support for Easy Anti-Cheat. We've seen some issues in the past like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-dev-understandably-not-happy-about-glibc-breaking-easy-anti-cheat-on-linux/" target="_blank">glibc updates breaking Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, so it <em>could</em> be related.</p>
<p>Currently, no matter the version of Proton picked either the official Proton or the community-made GE-Proton, The Division 2 will load until the Easy Anti-Cheat logo screen and then just get stuck in a loop trying to load it forever until you force-quit the game.</p>
<p>Shame, could have been a good fit for the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>The longest beard wins in wizard brawler MageQuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for a simpler action game to play with friends in local or online multiplayer? MageQuit isn't a new game, but I did miss that it added full Native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/572220/view/3271325539822338684" target="_blank">noticed</a> that the game wasn't working well with the Proton compatibility layer with the game crashing (even though it was "Steam Deck Verified" with Proton…), so they made a Native Linux version. Valve hasn't re-verified it, so you'll need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">manually</a> set it to use the Steam Linux Runtime if you're on Steam Deck but desktop Linux will download it normally.</p>
<p>This wizard brawler is all about "spell drafting and beard envy" with up to 10 players online or locally throwing around spells, with a beard that grows on each kill and the longest beard at the end of 9 rounds wins. There's 70 different spells to use, AI bots support, spell curving for trick shots, controller support, various game modes like teams or free for all, a dynamic soundtrack and cross-play between PC and Xbox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54iOlcE9_V8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3589f0cac4d573e4d8bf6e6c3a66ccc4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54iOlcE9_V8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's really nice to see more games like this that actually have offline play, some developers making the big mistake of being online-only and it's real difficult for smaller indie games like this to cut through the noise to get players.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/572220/MageQuit/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Old World - The Sacred and The Profane DLC adds a lot of new events</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World - The Sacred and The Profane is a new DLC for the impressive historical strategy game from Mohawk Games and publisher Hooded Horse. I'm actually really surprised by Old World, it arrived on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/old-world-from-the-civilization-iv-designer-releases-on-steam-along-with-linux-support/" target="_blank">back in May 2022</a> with full Native Linux support that worked great. Since then, they've continued regularly updating the game with new free content and upgrades.</p>
<p>This new DLC just dropped out of nowhere and it's pretty big too! While it's a historical game, this expansion is more about the "what if". It includes over 350 new events, new clergy characters, 10 new character traits, six new historical characters, new religious dissent mechanics as well as a bunch of "cult" city projects.</p>

      <title>The next Valheim biome will be Ashlands, a land of the dead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim developer Iron Gate AB has begun teasing the next biome update, and they're doing things a little bit differently with Ashlands. They're not going to be so secretive about it, as they want to be more transparent. This will also likely help for those who kept thinking they weren't doing enough, as their community was quite outspoken on how long Mistlands took to arrive.</p>
<p><em>While they won't be as secretive, it may mean they show things that don't end up making it into the game.</em></p>
<p>Ashlands is also not going to be spread across the map, instead it will be placed at the far south as a big volcanic island. They're also sharing some pre-production concept art of what they want it to have:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14221731491673951224gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14221731491673951224gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7532811241673951226gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7532811241673951226gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In regards to it taking a long time to add a new biome, they said they they do have some " fun things planned for you between then and now", which does include an Xbox version that has full cross-play support so you'll be able to play with your console buddies. They also teased some difficulty settings and something called "Hildir’s Quest", which will be a new NPC and a new way to re-style your hair. More clothes seem to be coming too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13111705391673951388gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13111705391673951388gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Accessibility is also going to be a focus in future, as they want more people to be able to play the game. They've suggested sending them an email, if you have a disability or anything else that affects your gaming to chat about possible solutions that might help. Nice to see a focus on that.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam desktop and Steam Deck Beta fixes up more on-screen keyboard issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh Steam desktop and Steam Deck Client Beta, with more fixes for the on-screen keyboard and other adjustments.</p>
<p>With the New Big Picture Mode being on desktop now, as continued from previous Beta releases a lot of the changes between them are similar or the same now.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6763877288741739919" target="_blank">changed</a> for desktop Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard opening on desktop and in-game when opened via controller.</li>

<p>And the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/5662747178724589491" target="_blank">notes</a> for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed opening onscreen keyboard in-game causing input to no longer go to game.</li>
<li>Added up/down cursor keys to keyboard, press shift then left/right cursor to use.</li>
<li>Added option to ignore Steam Rewards on Account page if they were registered by another user on the device.</li>
<li>Decreased size of the full &amp; partial controller support icons on app portraits.</li>
<li>Added pinned notifications for new inventory items, trade offers, async game turns, moderator messages, offline chat messages, and help request replies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once <em>again</em> though, they've copy pasted from the desktop Beta notes to Steam Deck, as the full and partial controller icons on app pictures are not on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 21: Fluffy Bunnies</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-20-the-antediluvian-world/" target="_blank">Part 20: The Antideluvian World</a></strong></p>
<p>While their foray into interactive storybooks did fail to impress, it did help remind me of BlackHoleSun Software, one of the earliest Indie developers to create games with Linux in mind. They were a cross-platform studio whose first game <em>Krilo </em>was boasted to be the first "commercial game that contained versions for Linux, Windows, MacOS, and BeOS on one CD-ROM", with at least some of their games having been developed from Linux and then ported to other systems.</p>
<p>Their most well known game<em> Bunnies</em> would be released as shareware in 2001, with the bunnies-1.06-x86linux.sh installer providing a demo version you could later update through the use of a retail key. Since BlackHoleSun Software is now out of business I can no longer register my copy of the game, which is a shame as <em>Bunnies</em> while braindead is still kind of fun. The demo limits me to playing only one map called "The Castle", with eleven further maps being teased.</p>
<p><em>Bunnies</em> also included a level editor for registered players which helped spawn an active mapping scene, with a collection of fan maps once being hosted on the BlackHoleSun Software website. Up to six rabbits can compete at any given time, and can be either computer or human controlled. The objective is simple; just move your rabbit to hop on top of other bunnies to make a rain of gibs fly out across the screen, or not if the "no gore" option has been set.</p>
<p>In fact, an entirely gore free version of the game was also made available, by using the bunnies-nogore-1.06-x86linux.sh script instead of the default installer. <em>Bunnies</em> allowed the player to connect to online servers for networked multiplayer, as well as for up to four players to play locally from a single computer. Gameplay modifiers include being able to toggle a low gravity mode, jetpacks, or even reversing the orientation of any given map.</p>
<p>Technically the game ran alright for me, but did produce a few segmentation faults and some graphical corruptions when displaying text fields. BlackHoleSun Software would go on to work on one more game, the 3D team based vehicular combat title <em>Aftermath,</em> before they folded up shop in the mid 2000s<em>. </em>At this point though the future of <em>Bunnies</em> or any of the other games from BlackHoleSun Software appears dead in the water.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1680471651671834404gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1680471651671834404gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7271695401671834195gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7271695401671834195gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, the story does not have to end there. <em>Bunnies</em> itself is derivative of the earlier game <em>Jump 'n Bump </em>released for MS-DOS in 1998 by developer Brainchild Design, with its source code made available a year later in 1999. This allowed the game to be ported over to Linux using the SimpleDirect Media Layer, with installation on Red Hat Linux 7.3 being made trivial by use of the jumpnbump-1.50-1.0.rh7.rf.i386.rpm package from freshrpms.</p>
<p><em>Jump 'n Bump</em> allows for up to four players to play over the network or from a local hotseat. The game also sported an active mapping scene in its day, with a number of additional maps once being available from the Brainchild Design website. Most of these maps can still be accessed through the Wayback Machine on the Internet Archive, although the need for someone to maintain a modern curated archive of these appears to be apparent.</p>
<p>If I am honest I would say the overall visual style and presentation of <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> is superior to <em>Bunnies</em>, with cleaner pixel art and a cute interactive menu screen. The gameplay is pretty much identical, with the same frantic hopping about and the same rain of gibs upon contact. Even most of the modifiers found in <em>Bunnies</em> can be unlocked inside <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> through the use of cheat codes, along with a few tweaks unique to <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> itself.</p>
<p>You can even activate AI controls by holding down the Alt key followed by the number of the player you wish to bring to life, allowing <em>Jump 'n Bump </em>to be tackled as a single player game. With its assets available work on <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> has continued apace, with a fork of the game supporting SDL2 still seeing active development. There is also a modern remake of the game based on the Godot Engine, and even a version made that can be ran from within a web browser.</p>
<p><em>Jump 'n Bump</em> is far from the only time the free software community has created an enduring game, with its close to twenty five years of existence seeming paltry in comparison to some of the classics. One of those classics wears many faces, but there is one face in particular that has remained etched in my memory for years, even if I never did get a good handle on the game's actual mechanics. It is time to change that.</p>
<p><strong>Carrying on in Part 22: Happy Hacking</strong></p>

      <title>Tabletop Club is a free and open source physics-based 3D tabletop game sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a Tabletop Simulator like experience but prefer free and open source games? Keep an eye on Tabletop Club. One I've been meaning to give a shout-out to for a little while, as I dig through a bunch of my missed items from before the holiday season.</p>
<p>Available under the MIT license on <a href="https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop-club" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://drwhut.itch.io/tabletop-club" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, it enables you to play various tabletop games offline or online without the need for registrations and logins as you can just host a game and share a room code with friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Tabletop Club, you are given a box of toys to play with, and it's up to you what you do with them! Sure, you can play board games, but why not make a house made of dice, then frisbee it with a poker chip? Draw on the table while waiting for your opponent to make a move in chess, or flip the table into deep space after losing an all-in bet? The table is your oyster!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developed using a modified <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it allows you to do pretty much anything, since you can import your own stuff into it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8875587651673882156gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Early days for the game project, with a first Beta version only going up in November last year. Nice to see more open source games appear though, especially stuff like this that can have such wide uses.</p>

      <title>Breachway is a deck-building Slay the Spire meets FTL: Faster Than Light </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Breachway looks like one to watch, a game the blends together the deck-building of Slay the Spire and space antics of FTL. Two of my favourite indie games right there, and I must admit Breachway looks pretty good.</p>
<p>In the game you will explore a randomized galaxy and build up a card deck of different ships, modules, crew and experiment with different combinations. You get to upgrade your ships too and unlock new cards to take into battle. According to a developer post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2118810/discussions/0/5704402939722726569/#c3728449612309803135" target="_blank">Steam</a>, they plan Linux support too with testing already going on for it. Have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J3ViAD06z8o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d2cd2107f89af8cf65d4d8ef94acbc37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J3ViAD06z8o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Ship upgrade system</strong> - Acquire powerful equipment for your ship, further enhancing its performance with a multitude of subsystems.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse tactical choices</strong> - Hack enemy equipment or disable it with precise rail-gun attacks, overwhelm your enemy with flak barrages, or cook them alive with laser attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Uncover powerful card synergies</strong> - Test out new card combinations and approaches to combat by mixing and matching equipment and cards in your deck.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble a rag-tag crew</strong> - Each crew member has their own quirks and allegiances that have an effect on how you react to encounters and deal with various factions.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock new ships and factions</strong> - Unlock special faction-specific ships as you play and experience the story and events from different angles.</li>
<li><strong>Carve your own unique path</strong> - Your crew and previous choices determine how you can interact with the varied events you encounter on your journey, while tense narrative encounters force you to grapple with morally grey decisions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stop an alien substance spreading in the Regulator City demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Regulator City is an upcoming action rogue-like from developer Orangepixel, where you're tasked with stopping the spread of a strange powerful alien substance.</p>
<p>This strange ooze is seeping out of an asteroid that crashed into the city, with various gangs using it to become stronger and more dangerous but you've got access to an apparently "safe" version of it to give you some special abilities of your own.</p>
<p>In the game you control a single character but you also have an AI controlled team supporting your every move, so technically you're all of them. You can lead the way, or hang back a bit and watch the chaos as your team goes in to take out all the bad guys. Use the AI as your weapon, the developer says.</p>
<p>You can see some gameplay from the developer below:</p>

      <title>State of the industry: MSI offered a chance to win the ability to buy a GPU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The GPU industry is so broken right now and to make things worse, MSI thought it would be a good idea to do a lottery for a chance to win the ability to buy a GPU. I had to do a triple-take to make sure I was reading it right.</p>
<p>I would really love to have been a fly on the wall in the meeting where MSI <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/luckyticketGPU" target="_blank">thought this</a> was a good idea. A competition that lasted all of 3 days, where people who signed up and entered would be put into a prize-draw where MSI would pull names out of a hat and give them the chance to buy a GeForce RTX 4090 within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Wow, that's super generous isn't it? <em>A "limited" amount of people would also get a $50 MSI store code.</em></p>
<p>I can't be alone in thinking that was just really weird, getting a chance to possibly spend money by entering a competition. What in the world…I thought doing a lottery was supposed to be the exact opposite of that. Did I fall into an alternate even worse universe recently?</p>
<p>Am I going insane, or is the GPU industry just a complete total mess right now? Prices are absolutely crazy, pricing out a huge amount of people with AMD and NVIDIA focusing mostly on the high-end with their latest chips, with both sides also having plenty of problems like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pci-sig-12vhpower-nvidia-statement" target="_blank">melted power connectors</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/amd-reveal-ryzen-7000-x3d-processors-desktop-65w-cpus-and-new-mobile-chips/" target="_blank">temperature issues</a> (noted at the bottom). Then we have Intel, whose new GPUs aren't exactly turning heads.</p>

      <title>Skul: The Hero Slayer adds a whole new Dark Mirror mode for a new challenge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Popular rogue-lite 2D platformer Skul: The Hero Slayer recently got a big upgrade with The Dark Mirror and it looks pretty great.</p>
<p>For those who want more of a challenge, this free update is for you. The Dark Mirror game mode is like a fresh dedicated hard mode for the game, adding in more powerful enemies and threats. However, the developer explained "We would like to say the Dark Mirror update is not just a hard mode that has increased the health and damage of the enemies. It is more of a new DLC, which includes a new story and content. We highly recommend that players personally experience the DLC's full content rather than experiencing it through written texts and images. For these reasons, further details related to the Dark Mirror will be included in the Dev Blog."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vuDlwQsa9XY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be02b497e28f6b9e5c21414c75040a94.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vuDlwQsa9XY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it does offer Native Linux support, I use the word "support" quite loosely here. It has a Linux version, but the developers don't actually seem to test it. The current version still gives you a black screen instead of an actual intro and main menu. It's an easy fix, setting "-force-vulkan" as a launch option for the game, something I told the developer about quite a few times but they haven't bothered to fix it.</p>
<p>Apart from the above, the game is a lot of fun though, swapping heads to gain different abilities is a fun game mechanic.</p>
<p>You can buy Skul: The Hero Slayer on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/skul-the-hero-slayer?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147560/Skul_The_Hero_Slayer/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve suffers a huge leak from various games like Portal, Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the season of leaks is continuing with Steam developer Valve now having a bunch of content from their games leaked online. Not the first though, as a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/left-4-dead-from-valve-has-a-prototype-leaked-online/" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead prototype</a> was leaked earlier.</p>
<p>This is a pretty huge leak, seemingly the biggest in their history and no doubt they won't be too happy about it. The leaked content includes assets from the likes of Portal, Counter Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half Life 2: Episodes 1 &amp; 2, Half-Life 2 multiplayer, and lots from Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>All the leaked stuff appeared on the "Valve Cut Content" Discord server as captured by <a href="https://twitter.com/richterovertime/status/1613464534815236096" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sylvia_braixen/status/1613404657803747330" target="_blank">Twitter</a> users, with the leaker named "Leakerwanderer" apparently holding onto the files <a href="https://twitter.com/NwolcRaving/status/1613601126737117191" target="_blank">since 2016</a>, and a bunch of it apparently comes from a repository that Valve "licenses to people when they pay for Havok and sign the NDA for the source engine". No doubt a treasure trove for people who love seeing what could have been in various Valve games.</p>
<p>As for why this Leakerwanderer did it, they started by explaining they noticed "recently that stuff was leaking through (sadly) Tyler McVicker, I decided to upload my copies of what I noticed was not uploaded today". So some of it was done due to frustrations about previous small leaks.</p>
<p>They went on to say "I am completely disconnected from the community, I'm just here to upload my copies from what otherwise I believe is something that's been floating around for a while now.", they continued, "I also did my toying around with it for a few years, did not upload because I was threatened everytime." and "I don't care anymore. That person is no longer in contact.".</p>
<p><em>They didn't elaborate on who was threatening or who they were in touch with previously. </em></p>
<p>No doubt Valve will more closely guard what is shared with any partners in future. </p>

<p>Leaks can be interesting but I just want to know what some actual new stuff from Valve is, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/neon-prime-from-valve-is-reportedly-a-third-person-shooter-close-to-release/" target="_blank">Neon Prime</a>. </p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Gamescope (used on Steam Deck) adds in some VR support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What are you up to Valve? Gamescope, software used on the Steam Deck for Gaming Mode that handles displaying everything recently had some VR work pulled in. Perhaps for the upcoming Deckard VR HMD?</p>
<p>Pointed out by Brad Lynch on <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1613605375844012032" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, it's certainly raising a few eyebrows. On the GitHub page the code merge request titled "<a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/742" target="_blank">vr_session: Initial implementation</a>" was pulled into Gamescope 2 days ago and the question is — why?</p>
<p>Thanks to many different sources (like Lynch above), we've known for a while that Valve appear to be working on a new VR HMD code-named Deckard. One that will seemingly support wireless play without it needing to be attached to a PC, but also supporting being connected to a PC to run games that need more power. The standalone mode will no doubt run Linux, and <em>perhaps</em> this Gamescope work is progress towards that end.</p>
<p><em>It could also be completely unrelated of course.</em></p>
<p>What do you think Valve are up to?</p>
<p>Valve have been on a bit of a roll lately getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> into a pretty incredible state for running Windows games on Linux, releasing the Steam Deck powered by SteamOS Linux, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-hits-over-7000-games-playable/" target="_blank">over 7,000</a> games now rated at least Playable for Steam Deck, the HDR teasers (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/valve-dev-teases-hdr-support-for-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">#2</a>), <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-breaks-more-records-with-33-million-online-and-over-10-million-gaming/" target="_blank">breaking their own records</a>, getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-with-linux-now-available-in-tesla-cars-beta/" target="_blank">Steam into Tesla vehicles</a> and so much more.</p>

      <title>System76 teasing new fully AMD powered Pangolin Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 saw your many comments and they're going to deliver. The Pangolin is making a return, powered by all AMD.</p>
<p>Every time they announce something, there's plenty of comments here and across the web asking them for more AMD units and so the Pangolin will deliver with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U processor and AMD Radeon 680M graphics too. If that's not enough to make you drool it also has a 144Hz display, with compatibility for DDR5 RAM and PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage. They also bumped up the battery to 70Wh with a claim of "up to" 10 hours battery life, but possibly longer.</p>
<p><em>All sounds pretty good!</em></p>

<p>Over email they also mentioned they heard your privacy calls, so it will also have a physical hardware privacy switch to fully disable both the webcam and microphone.</p>
<p>Tech specs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Operating System: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.</li>
<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 6800U: 2.7 up to 4.7 GHz - 8 Cores - 16 Threads.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Buyers receive "lifetime support" and it will start at $1,299. They've begun something of a <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/pangolin-teaser" target="_blank">teaser campaign</a> for it, with no exact release date set just yet.</p>

      <title>Google to release a tool to enable Bluetooth on the Stadia Controller</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google is getting ready to shut down Stadia now, their cloud gaming service, but they have some good news for those with the Stadia Controller.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-General/A-Gift-from-the-Stadia-Team-amp-Bluetooth-Controller/m-p/85936/highlight/true#M34875" target="_blank">a post</a> on the Stadia forum, they weirdly put up a new game today called <a href="https://stadia.google.com/game/worm-game" target="_blank">Worm Game</a>. Which it seems you'll be able to play for a few days until Stadia shuts down on January 18. Why the new game? Well, it's what they used to test things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play the game that came to Stadia before Stadia came to the world. “Worm Game” is a humble title we used to test many of Stadia’s features, starting well before our 2019 public launch, right through 2022. It won’t win Game of the Year, but the Stadia team spent a LOT of time playing it, and we thought we’d share it with you. Thanks for playing, and for everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, more importantly, the Stadia Controller will have the Bluetooth turned on so the controller now won't be useless without a USB wired in. They said "In addition, many of you have expressed the desire to enable Bluetooth on the Stadia controller. We have some good news: next week we'll be releasing a self-serve tool to enable Bluetooth connections on your Stadia Controller. We'll share details next week on how to enable this feature."</p>
<p>I can imagine this tool will be Windows-only but then perhaps it might even work in Wine.</p>
<p>Still a shame that Stadia is vanishing but Google failed it miserably from being incredibly slow to add simple store features (reminds me of Epic Games…), to the ridiculous business model. Back in November 2021, I even wrote an article titled "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/two-years-on-stadia-seems-to-have-no-direction-left/" target="_blank">Two years on, Stadia seems to have no direction left</a>" and ~10 months later they announced the shut down.</p>
<p><em>At least they refunded everyone though. I have to give credit where it's due for that.</em></p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic sold 2.3 million copies last year and I&#39;m not surprised - it&#39;s awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic is a game about a bunch of Dwarves going mining, and there's lots of creepy-crawlies that want to get in the way. It seems to only be getting more popular as time goes on too.</p>
<p>Playable basically to perfection on Linux with Proton, and works really well on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/3640630403132894028" target="_blank">2022 review post</a> on Steam, they mentioned they've now hit over 5.5 million copies sold and 2.3 million of those were actually last year. For a game that launched in 2020, with early access before that — it's mighty impressive actually. Over 500,000 people have put more than 100 hours into the game too (me being one of them), with 113,700 daily active players, they're doing very well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zeeVEvcSjAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ffacc6441b97c259e82f5780f30f00c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zeeVEvcSjAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Part of it is how great the community around it is too with a popular Hololive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7h1zllAov8" target="_blank">vtuber</a> taking a look, and a big post on the Deep Rock Galactic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/106hw8p/attention_brothers_and_sisters_we_have_a_very/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> being thoroughly welcoming with a mod stating "PSA: Be accepting and welcoming towards new miners, no matter where they come from. Greenbeards joining the ranks should be celebrated. Spend your energy helping a few greenbeards out instead of being grumpy on the internet. The community is a big part of what keeps Deep Rock Galactic great." (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/space-dwarves-embrace-weeb-invasion-after-popular-vtuber-streams-their-favorite-game/" target="_blank">GamesRadar</a>).</p>
<p>You can see a previous video I did on Steam Deck above, and even multiple livestreams of it running on Steam Deck (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWxn2iMILdM" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu_BXaiI92M" target="_blank">#2</a>). Going back 2 years ago, I took a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izjtsZT11TA" target="_blank">video</a> of the 1.0 release on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p><em>Word on the street is: more Deep Rock livestreams from GamingOnLinux are coming, keep it schtum, and follow along on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">the YouTube</a>.</em></p>
<p>The number #3 cause of death in Deep Rock Galactic is apparently friendly fire too. I'm sure some of the people I play with will blame <em>me</em>, but in my defense you keep running in front of my flames and bullets. It's definitely <em>not</em> my aim…clearly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E0osQdzyFY" target="_blank">I am very good at games</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/deep-rock-galactic?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The next release of 0 A.D. will have experimental Vulkan API support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is an in-development free and open source RTS, one that's very promising and looks pretty good and the next Alpha version will also feature experimental Vulkan support.</p>
<p>Performance has been a problem for 0 A.D. across many versions, so I'm quite hopeful that this will help towards that. They put up a very brief <a href="https://play0ad.com/the-next-alpha-of-0-a-d-will-feature-an-experimental-vulkan-backend/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, which links to a <a href="https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/104382-vulkan-new-graphics-api/#comments" target="_blank">forum post</a> going into more details. It's currently going through testing, with the developer asking people to give it a run (although you would need to compile it from source) so that they can get Vulkan into a stable state ready for release. However, a Release Candidate should be available sometime soon to make that easier.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting better performance yet though, as they need to work on the multi-threading. Right now they're focused on ensuring it works and doesn't run into driver problems.</p>
<p>See their previous release trailer below:</p>

<p>It seems they actually realised at least for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-steam-deck-beta-improves-controller-configurator-plus-linux-fixes/" target="_blank">update before this</a>, that they had copy / pasted a feature from desktop to Steam Deck not actually available on Steam Deck. The feature being the new full / partial controller icon being added on game hover in your library, as they actually went back and removed it from the changelog. The one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">before that</a> still lists some controller options not actually available on Steam Deck though — would be nice if these things were checked fully before going out in their official changelogs to not confuse users.</p>

      <title>Dino Run DX has the source code opened up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems more developers are warming up to the idea of open source. Pixeljam recently opened up the source code to Dino Run DX.</p>
<p>Currently, the download is only available via their Discord server as per their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/248330/view/3639504956058288978" target="_blank">announcement</a> and there's seemingly no license attached to it yet, so I'm hesitant to say it's fully "open source" until we see what license they actually put it under. They did say on Discord they do plan to put it up on GitHub with a proper license, so I guess we'll see.</p>
<p>From their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're open-sourcing Dino Run DX.</p>
<p>As some of our most dedicated players have discovered, Dino Run DX multiplayer no longer works. The wonderful folks at Xgen Studios, who basically let multiplayer live rent-free for years, had to recently sunset all of their legacy games (like Stick Arena) and the servers that run them. And as you can imagine, Dino Run used those servers.<br/>
<br/>
They DID send us the source code to the server itself, so maybe we can get it up and running again on our end. However, we haven't been able to compile the actual game for years now, since it's legacy flash and that no longer works on any computer that we own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always sad when games are lost to time, many developer had issues with Flash and Air but there's quite a few ways to get them running now thanks to open source. Perhaps it can be ported over to something like <a href="https://www.openfl.org/" target="_blank">OpenFL</a> to allow it to continue on.</p>

      <title>Hogwarts Legacy to be Steam Deck Verified at launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For Harry Potter fans, the upcoming release of Hogwarts Legacy is fast approaching and it seems they're making sure it works on Steam Deck. Well, that might be a bit of a stretch, they might have just loaded it up to see if it works, but the result to players is the same.</p>
<p>When asked about the status of it on Twitter, the official WB Games Support account <a href="https://twitter.com/WBGamesSupport/status/1613595212982489090" target="_blank">noted</a> "We reached out to the Hogwarts Legacy team for you and were able to confirm that the game WILL be Steam Deck verified on launch. We hope this helps with your decision! Take care." — good news for anyone who plans to pick it up. Being Steam Deck Verified almost always means it will work well on desktop Linux too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BsC-Rl9GYy0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3607ad83144f36a96abe274fc09001b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BsC-Rl9GYy0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world action RPG set in the world first introduced in the Harry Potter books. Embark on a journey through familiar and new locations as you explore and discover magical beasts, customize your character and craft potions, master spell casting, upgrade talents and become the wizard you want to be.</p>
<p>Experience Hogwarts in the 1800s. Your character is a student who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. Make allies, battle Dark wizards, and ultimately decide the fate of the wizarding world. Your legacy is what you make of it. Live the Unwritten.</p>

<p>Something to be aware of though, are all the issues surrounding the Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. An article on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/01/12/the-hogwarts-legacy-debate-explained/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> goes through some of it and goes into better detail than I can. <em>Comments on it are open, as long as people don’t throw around insults at each other, respectful debate is fine.</em></p>

      <title>Intel reveals the Core i9-13900KS that hits 6Ghz out of the box</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people that love chasing Ghz, Intel has a surprise for you. They revealed the Intel Core i9-13900KS today that hits 6Ghz max turbo out of the box. They claim it's now the world's fastest desktop processor, the first processor in history able to hit 6Ghz out of the box.</p>
<p>It's a "special edition" processor, that will become available on January 12, 2023 priced at $699. Nearly <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/compare.html?productIds=232167,230496" target="_blank">identical</a> to the 13900K except for the obvious bump in speeds across various parts of it like the performance core base frequency going from 3GHz to 3.20GHz, the efficient core base frequency going from 2.20Ghz to 2.40Ghz and the max now being 6Ghz. It's also more power hungry with the base power upped to 150W (up from 125W) but the max turbo requirement is the same 253W.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Up to 6.0 GHz max turbo frequency with Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost – the first CPU in the PC industry to reach 6.0 GHz without overclocking.</li>
<li>Intel® Adaptive Boost Technology for improved gaming performance by opportunistically allowing higher multicore turbo frequencies.</li>
<li>24 cores (eight Performance-cores and 16 Efficient-cores), 32 threads, 150W processor base power, 36MB Intel Smart Cache and a total of 20 PCIe lanes (16 PCIe 5.0 and four PCIe 4.0 lanes).</li>
<li>Up to DDR5 5600 MT/s and DDR4 3200 MT/s support.</li>
<li>Compatible with Z790 and Z690 motherboards, with the latest BIOS recommended for the best gaming and content creation experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The Core i9-13900KS continues our 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family excellence, showcasing the new performance heights made possible by our performance hybrid architecture. Extreme gamers and enthusiasts can now push their everyday performance further than ever before with the first desktop processor in the PC industry to provide 6.0 GHz speeds at stock.”</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress too retro? Songs of Syx is worth looking at with another big Beta update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder that in many ways could be compared with Dwarf Fortress, only with a graphical style that's just a bit more modern. A new Beta release went up recently and it's another big one. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access it already has quite a lot of depth to it, and I was <em>incredibly</em> impressed with the first EA release I tried out ,putting a fair amount of hours into it. Honestly it sucked away a lot of my time when it first came out, good to see it continue to add some really good stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15583602961673537927gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15583602961673537927gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what version 63 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing events.</li>
<li>A new Machinery resource for upgrading rooms, along with a machinery workshop for it.</li>
<li>Difficulty settings for random games.</li>
<li>A whole newly added Tourism system.</li>
<li>A serial killer event (oh my!), along with individual crime statistics.</li>
<li>Herbs you can now grow.</li>
<li>Mini-actions for people like giving out free drinks, free money, a day off etc.</li>
<li>Benches, at last people can find a nice spot to sit.</li>
<li>+ Absolutely <u>LOADS</u> more.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">You can see the full update overview from the developer below. It's in Beta that you can opt into on Steam, and should roll out for everyone a few weeks after:</span></p>

      <title>Mega Man-like side-scroller action game Super Alloy Ranger now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy games similar to Mega Man? Like running and gunning? Super Alloy Ranger looks interesting and they recently put up a Native Linux version too. The update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1944060/view/3640628950032517687" target="_blank">January 5th</a> added support for Linux, macOS, added 50 new achievements, new Steam community items and plenty of optimization too.</p>
<p>"Utilize various movement techniques to conquer the challenging levels; running, jumping, dashing, mid-air dash, wall climbing and double jumps. Use them wisely to track down the wanted criminal; this could be in sunken cities, the freezing Sea of Frost, the endless Abyssal Mines and many more places. Whatever it takes, you will find out the truth and head back with victory!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JQQCPHozbc4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ca6c387ac95bb7475a10eb447060b69.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JQQCPHozbc4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic side-scrolling mode of operation, dodge the bullets while jumping, dashing and climbing to progress with the level.</li>
<li>Many hidden pathways are waiting for you to explore.</li>
<li>Both characters have many weapons and combat styles up for selection.</li>
<li>Challenge gigantic boss enemies in dangerous barrages.</li>
<li>Incorporated the main features of Mega Man and Metal Slug. On top of that corresponding combat mechanism is added to the game!</li>
<li>Fun and exquisite pixel animations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At time of writing it has a Very Positive user rating so it seems like it could be worth your time, although it has mostly flown under the radar with only 110 user reviews on Steam. For gamers who love these retro-fuelled fast-paced run and gun action platformers I must say it does look pretty good!</p>

      <title>Pokemon-like &#39;Coromon&#39; finally has big FPS problem fixed for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coromon is another attempt to make a Pokemon styled game and while it is a lot of fun, the game had a major frustrating problem on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton that has now been solved.</p>
<p>When covering it initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/coromon-is-pretty-much-pokemon-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">back in April 2022</a>, I noted how it looked good and ran quite well until the performance would suddenly hard-drop down to 14FPS and just lock itself there. It would do it like clockwork every single time after a while of playing it (around an hour or so) and it was the same on desktop Linux too. The game was Steam Deck Verified by Valve back in April 2022, and stayed Verified the entire time which is another clear example of Deck Verified just <em>not</em> being thorough enough because this issue happened to <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although rather late on it, the developer found the issue and fixed it in an update released in December 2022. So now it actually deserves the Steam Deck Verified rating.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developer actually went onto Valve's Proton GitHub page to give an <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5828#issuecomment-1328015908" target="_blank">explanation</a> of what the issue was, to help others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developer of Coromon here, we've been investigating this issue for some time now and we're finally able to pinpoint where the issue is coming from. Just dropping our findings here to help someone else perhaps fix the core issue.</p>
<p>The FPS drop starts happening after the <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> Steam SDK API is called roughly ~130.000 times (~36.5 minutes converted to seconds * 60FPS).<br/>
The <a href="https://github.com/coronalabs/com.coronalabs-plugin.steamworks" target="_blank">steamworks plugin</a> of our engine calls this on every frame to determine whether OpenGL should force a render to ensure the overlay is being updated. We tested decreasing the polling rate to the <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> to once every 10 frames, this delayed the FPS drop to 6 hours (360 minutes) instead of 36 minutes. This also changed the constant FPS drop into a frame spike every 10 frames, so it seems to me <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> starts to take a lot of CPU time after it is called over ~130.000 times.</p>
<p>We tested on every available Proton version on Steam, Proton 4.2-9 &amp; Proton 3.16-9 do not have this glitch somehow.</p>
<p>We'll be releasing an update of our game soon where we decrease the polling rate even further to allow sessions of at least 18 hours without the FPS drop, but a better solution would be a fix for <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> in Proton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So unless you're doing a single run longer than 18 hours (what?!) you're fine now.</em></p>
<p>It's actually pretty great to see a developer explain things like this, I wished more did. It can help Proton developers, and other game developers for future problems.</p>
<p>As usual here's a video with some fresh gameplay and a little discussion for people who prefer videos now:</p>

      <title>Steam &amp; Steam Deck Beta improves controller configurator plus Linux fixes (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update at 20:10 UTC</strong>: this Beta seems to have a pretty <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9094" target="_blank">major bug</a>. I would suggest you stay away from it for now otherwise you might find you can't open things on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valve has released a new Steam Client Beta for both desktop and Steam Deck, with new fixes and some new features too like showing full or partial controller icons when hovering over items.</p>
<p>The changelog is basically the <em>same</em> with different titles across <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3642882655783105850" target="_blank">desktop</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5662747178707105871" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>, with the desktop client having an additional fix for macOS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing download regions no longer requires restarting the Steam client</li>
<li>Show icons for partial and full controller support in Library when a game portrait is focused or hovered</li>
<li>Add a rollup of gifts received in the Quick Access &gt; Notifications area</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller configurator now groups commands if they are attached to the same input</li>
<li>Controller configuration browsing screen can now preview configurations and the selection processes now previews then applies instead of directly selecting the configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>Desktop Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some errors causing the Library not to render properly</li>
<li>Fix the "Start in Big Picture Mode" setting not updating</li>
<li>Center the navigation column in the Big Picture Overlay vertically to match the rest of the main menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual Keyboard</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone keyboard can now be brought up outside of Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed some issues using the Paste button outside of a web context</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An important detail they seem to have left out though, is that this new full / partial controller icon that appears when you hover over a game in your library is not actually on Steam Deck. It appears to only work on a desktop PC in the New Big Picture Mode (it doesn't even appear on Steam Deck Desktop Mode with New Big Picture either). This is the second time they've noted something not actually there for the Steam Deck, like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">last Beta mentioning</a> new controller options for idle turn off time and turn it off when exiting Big Picture. Seems they once again copy and pasted bits of the changelog, without enabling it on Steam Deck directly.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks on Desktop Steam:</p>

      <title>Valve remind people to be careful where you buy a Steam Deck </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the official OnDeck Twitter account from Steam creator Valve posted a PSA (public service announcement), reminding people on being careful where they buy a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1612952676173742081" target="_blank">Twitter</a> they posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, and happy new year! A quick note that the only official ways to purchase Steam Deck are directly from Steam (in the US, CA, EU, and UK), or from Komodo (JP, KR, TW, and HK). Steam Decks sold via any other websites or retailers are unofficial - please be careful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are they posting it? Well, they of course haven't mentioned anyone or anything else directly, but it's likely in part due to the store I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/beware-of-scam-steam-deck-and-steam-account-stores/" target="_blank">in an article and video recently</a> that teamed up with accessory brand JSAUX. This store was selling Steam Accounts, Steam Gifts and more that are against Valve's terms and would get people banned from the platform, in addition to always claiming they have a discount on every model of Steam Deck with them being "brand new".</p>
<p><em>My video on that is still blocked on <a href="https://youtu.be/wKZ3k2zutBo" target="_blank">YouTube</a> in the UK for "defamation", a mirror is on <a href="https://tilvids.com/w/sx3oWxzUqQeHDe3pjmfH9k" target="_blank">TILVids</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the UK at least, there's actually nothing wrong with reselling. You buy something, it's yours. The key point is to be careful: if a deal looks too good, it probably is too good to be true. There's also no real reason in the UK or the US to buy one new from somewhere other than Valve.</p>
<p>There are plenty of places Valve are not yet supplying though, which is part of a wider issue. Hopefully this year Valve will announce more regions they will serve officially or through a partner like they do with Komodo for some parts of Asia.</p>

      <title>Check out the new release of Kandria a hand-crafted 2D action game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have to admit, not many platformer-likes catch my attention nowadays but Kandria certainly looks the part. This new Native Linux game just launched from the tiny team at Shirakumo Games, the lead of which is also part of <a href="https://shirakumo.org/" target="_blank">Shirakumo Collective</a> who do some open source software too (including their game engine).</p>
<p>What is it? Kandria is a hand-crafted 2D role-playing action game that resembles a metroidvania. The developers say it has all the platforming puzzle elements of games like Celeste, but also features some slick swordplay found in the likes of NieR:Automata with a sprinkling of a post-apocalyptic world. It also has a lovely soundtrack to it!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="usc0Znm-gbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12ef5b8629ec446d81840dc50abc9b1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/usc0Znm-gbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as The Stranger, a powerful android recently unearthed from the ruins of the old world.</li>
<li>Fight against rogue robots and malcontent humans - you’re faster, stronger, and more resilient. But are you smarter?</li>
<li>When you think you’ve mastered things, prepare yourself for epic boss battles with beasts and machines, which slumber and lurk deep beneath the earth.</li>
<li>Explore vast, open and interconnected levels full of non-linear missions, challenging platforming, and gorgeous pixel art decay - cross the barren surface, or spelunk deep underground.</li>
<li>Meet diverse characters and factions struggling to survive; determine friend from foe, and choose allies wisely as you forge your own future amongst the ruins.</li>
<li>Experience an epic story of mystery, grit and self-determination, all the way to its inevitable end. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see another game that was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria/description" target="_blank">crowdfunded</a> deliver!</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://shinmera.itch.io/kandria" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Remember to support the projects you use and appreciate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In light of some recent news surrounding the MSI Afterburner software, it's another reminder that it's quite important for people to directly support projects they use and enjoy. <em>No this isn't me asking you to support my Patreon or anything.</em></p>
<p>While this first bit isn't Linux related, stick with it a moment. On the guru3D forum, the developer on Afterburner <a href="https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/7900xt-power-usage-not-visible.446010/#post-6089040" target="_blank">noted</a> "MSI afterburner project is probably dead" and later <a href="https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/7900xt-power-usage-not-visible.446010/#post-6090142" target="_blank">elaborated</a> "War and politics are the reasons" (Ukraine and Russia) and mentioned "the project is semi abandoned by company during quite a long time already" with MSI apparently not "performing their obligations under Afterburner license agreement" with the developer not being paid for their work. MSI are <a href="https://twitter.com/hms1193/status/1612449753903554560" target="_blank">claiming</a> "product marketing &amp; accounting team are dealing with this problem now" and mentioned the war was causing payment issues.</p>
<p>Regardless of what's <em>really</em> happening it's a stark reminder that a <em>lot</em> of things we use directly and probably take for granted, or things other bigger projects use, are often developed and supported by single people (or only a few people). So if there's something you're using that you want to keep using, and see it keep working, perhaps it's a good time to throw some direct support behind it?</p>
<p>Makes me think about projects like <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> for Linux, the awesome way to get a Vulkan and OpenGL overlay on top of games that lets you monitor things like FPS, temperatures, system load, frame timings, benchmarking and more. MangoHud is even used on the Steam Deck, it's the performance overlay. Valve do sponsor the development on it but imagine if they didn't or just stopped (there's also direct support links on their GitHub).</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12556950641673460308gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12556950641673460308gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>That's MangoHud in the bottom right corner. Just ignore the frame timing spike, Dying Light 2 does not like its photo to be taken, it's a bit camera shy.</em></p>
<p>We also have other great projects like the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, which has become very popular since the Steam Deck release to help people manage GOG and Epic Games Store on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. It only just recently expanded to handle games from other sources. I could keep on naming various important Linux gaming projects for hours. It's just another relevant easy example.</p>
<p>There's been worse <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/" target="_blank">examples</a> to bring up like the time a developer on the faker.js and colors.js projects decided to stop doing it, and ended up pushing out a malicious update screwing over everyone using it. Why? They <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https:/github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046" target="_blank">were fed up</a> of "Fortune 500s ( and other smaller sized companies )" using their work without supporting it.</p>
<p>So to sum up this little reminder if you able to: give back to the projects you use and love, don't let them fade away.</p>

      <title>3 Minutes to Midnight devs say it&#39;s going well for full Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>3 Minutes to Midnight is an upcoming comedy adventure game from Scarecrow Studio. It was funded on Kickstarter and their latest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scarecrowstudio/3-minutes-to-midnight-a-comedy-graphic-adventure/posts/3699700" target="_blank">development update</a> sounds great.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of this one before it's styled much like classic LucasArts point &amp; click adventures but with some twists including puzzles that have many solutions, lots of hidden content, actions that have consequences so your next run may be quite different and much more to make it replayable. Check out their original trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LKoIjDqoJns"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d74bf41b43b192a52cb2e32caab28adf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LKoIjDqoJns" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With their development update out they make it clear it's going well, and they've designed a special automated test that can run through the entire game that they've been repeatedly using to help development move along. While it took time away from the actual game development, they said this AI player has already helped them find "over 60 extremely difficult-to-find game-breaking bugs". So I have high hopes for this to be nicely polished at release.</p>
<p>As for Linux and Steam Deck support directly, they made it clear their Linux testing has showed their Native version working across Fedora, Mint, and Arch and they "have yet to find any unexpected issues". That's an impressive level of support, you don't see many indie developers doing that! It will also have gamepad support, steam cloud saves and when talking about Steam Deck they said "Since SteamOS is a Linux-based operating system, 3 Minutes to Midnight will therefore be fully compatible with Steam Deck.".</p>
<p>You can follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/832500/3_Minutes_to_Midnight__A_Comedy_Graphic_Adventure/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver &#39;NVK&#39; begins to run games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/nvk-is-a-new-open-source-mesa-vulkan-driver-for-nvidia-gpus/" target="_blank">October last year</a> I wrote about the new open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver named NVK, and now it appears to be able to actually run games. Not particularly well though.</p>
<p>This NVK driver is not from NVIDIA but is instead a new Mesa driver but is a serious effort to see if they can get it into a state where it's usable like what the RADV is to AMD hardware.</p>
<p>Posting on their <a href="https://chaos.social/@karolherbst/109666048560595911" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> account, driver developer Karol Herbst showed a screenshot of it now capable of loading up The Talos Principle with a follow-up noting "performance is terrible, but that's hopefully resolved with the GSP work which is still ongoing :)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16798902601673443366gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16798902601673443366gol1.png"/></a>Image Credit - Karol Herbst</em></p>
<p>Seems like 2023 could be a really fun year for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, if this work continues to improve. Given the work involved, it will likely be a good while before performance is actually at a playable stage.</p>

      <title>This new Steam Deck external controller plugin is quite useful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can use a lot of external controllers with the Steam Deck but the current system to interact with them isn't great. The <a href="https://github.com/alphamercury/ControllerTools" target="_blank">Controller Tools</a> plugin could solve some issues, at least until Valve give this section a little more love.</p>
<p>Giving you currently a quick way to see connection type, charge level and charge status for some controllers in a dedicated menu. It currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation DualSense.</li>
<li>Playstation DualShock 4.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S Controller (limited support).</li>
<li>Xbox One Controller (limited support).</li>
</ul>
<p>With plans to expand it with new features like controller light configuration, more controllers based on community requests for them, low-battery in-game alerts and more.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at it, along with a note on the How Long To Beat plugin too:</p>

      <title>Counterplay Games makes tactical card battler Duelyst completely open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is awesome and something more developers should do with games they shut down. Counterplay Games have made their mix of a collectable card game and a turn-based strategy Duelyst fully open source.</p>
<p>With proper Native support for Linux, macOS and Windows the entire game has been set free for everyone. So people can play free, and use the code and artwork for other games thanks to the Creative Commons Zero license. It seems they plan to eventually turn it into "Duelyst Classic" with a full release but they also note in the video below that other indie teams are already working with their code. A little confusing but likely alluding to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2004320/Duelyst_II/" target="_blank">Duelyst II</a> that's now on Steam from Dream Sloth Games so they likely just got the code access early to do so.</p>
<p>Announced yesterday in a YouTube video announcement you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h3Cuz6d_7x0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bb438925be538e15114a209443aaf9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h3Cuz6d_7x0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can play it right now too in single-player and multi-player, although it's using their "staging" servers until it's ready for the eventual classic re-release.</p>
<p>Thanks to the entire thing being released like this, Duelyst could end up becoming one of the most professional and popular open source games around. I'll be keeping an eye on this one for you to see when the proper Duelyst Classic releases from this.</p>
<p>Checking it out briefly, on Fedora 37 it worked completely out of the box when downloading the latest release so that's great to see.</p>
<p>All of it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/open-duelyst/duelyst" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and they provide release builds for each platform too.</p>
<p>Here's an overview video with some gameplay:</p>

      <title>Stop mixing magnets with the Steam Deck or face fan and temperature troubles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems people haven't learned from the debacle with the dbrand Project Killswitch case <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/project-killswitch-sales-suspended-as-the-kickstand-messed-with-the-steam-deck-fan/" target="_blank">using magnets</a> that causes problems with certain Steam Deck fan speeds.</p>
<p>Recently, a company sent over a Power Bank to look over and potentially do an article and video on. After spending time with it and being ready to do a video, the company then sent a follow-up email to warn me that it's actually a bit problematic. The issue: the Power Bank uses a magnetic mount to attach it to the Steam Deck, and magnets do not play nicely with the Delta fans (which Valve still use in addition to the Huaying model).</p>
<p>So I made a decision <em>not</em> to cover it in a video (and article review) and instead do a PSA (public service announcement), because no doubt a few people won't check their fan. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BNXGVZTS" target="_blank">This</a> is the item in question, and really: just go for basically any other Power Bank that won't potentially mess with your Steam Deck. Even on the Huaying fans, it could still potentially cause problems. In a lot of cases the Steam Deck already gets pretty high temperatures, adding to that is not going to be a good idea. Why risk it? Don't.</p>
<p>So what Power Bank to actually go for? As long as it has at least 45w delivery through PD 3.0 and a good battery size, you should be fine for actual charging. Just again — don't mess with magnets. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">Deckmate system</a> is a good way to attach things to the back of a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>To companies and people making things for Steam Deck: just stop using magnets. I get it, they're cheaper than designing a locking method but please stop.</p>

      <title>DOSBox Staging adds dual-mouse gaming and ReelMagic support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Staging is a favourite of mine to follow that expands on the original DOSBox but with a focus on implementing new features and fixes. A new major update went out in December 2022 with some big additions. <em>It's supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the old original DOSBox.</em></p>
<p>Release 0.80.0 and the follow-up bug-fix 0.80.1 adds in support for ReelMagic, an MPEG playback board and so DOS games that depended on it will now work in DOSBox Staging. However, they suggest only enabling it when needed. Eventually they will also be adding in DMA support too.</p>
<p>They also added in dual-mouse gaming so that multiple physical mice attached can be mapped to emulated mouse interfaces, allowing two-player split-screen gaming like found in The Settlers and The Settlers II amongst other games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10377522201673363107gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10377522201673363107gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - X-Com on Linux with DOSBox Staging</em></p>
<p>On top of that some helper text was added like telling you how the mouse can be captured and released from DOSBox, more settings work properly while a game is running like video resolution, OpenGL shaders, audio devices and others. There's also some additional OpenGL shaders included, plus some bug fixes.</p>

      <title>20 years later the open source Colonization game FreeCol hits 1.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Took a while huh? It's not quite as well-known or as loved as some other free and open source games, but worth pointing out: FreeCol 1.0 is out now. 20 years in the making for this Sid Meier's Colonization remake!</p>
<p>Even though it's technically <em>finished</em>, the team behind it say they plan to continue upgrading the game and FreeCol 2.0 will have many features added towards what they and players imagine "Colonization 2 would have been". Games are never actually truly finished huh?</p>
<p>Some of what's new in the 1.0 release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New nation specific colony graphics.</li>
<li>New forest graphics.</li>
<li>Major changes to the tile goods production so that the actual values matches the original game.</li>
<li>Greatly improved artificial intelligence (AI) for the computer players.</li>
<li>Much better stability (many bug fixes).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They did also have another release towards the middle of last year if you missed it that added in music, animated rivers, improved performance, plenty of art updates and more.<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4296319441673361608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4296319441673361608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin got a big speed boost for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GameCube and the Wii emulator Dolphin had a <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/12/21/dolphin-progress-report-september-october-november-2022/" target="_blank">progress report</a> posted up in late December, and it's looking really good, especially so with their performance optimization work.</p>
<p>As usual plenty of new features are coming in like support for WiiConnect24, a service for staying connected online but it was terminated by Nintendo (but alternatives like WiiLink and RiiConnect24 exist). Now Dolphin should work nicely with it.</p>
<p>More exciting though is that their team has been doing a lot of work with Vulkan lately including the use of the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator" target="_blank">Vulkan Memory Allocator</a>, which gives them better memory management. Their optimization continued, thanks to the release of the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> where they realised they could do better. One game in particular stuck out with Super Mario Galaxy (Wii) not performing like it should, and they ended up finding something they were doing eating up a lot of CPU time which as it turns out was a <em>regression</em> from two years ago. After sorting that, it was optimized even further and in their simulated Steam Deck testing they showed performance going from 85FPS to 140FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3885826781673356232gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3885826781673356232gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em><a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-spoiler-alert-bbk-s-dolphin-screenshots-thread-56k-warning?pid=285241#pid285241" target="_blank">Image Credit</a> - Dolphin Forum</em></p>
<p>They also made it clear some <em>direct</em> Steam Deck testing showed a clear improvement too with "Super Mario Galaxy (and a little of Super Mario Galaxy 2)" performing now "at full speed and 2x Internal Resolution without any noticeable slowdown".</p>
<p>Overall, sounds like a nice performance win for all users but especially those on Steam Deck. On desktop though they said they saw Super Mario Galaxy games get an improvement of about "30%" even when running at "4x Internal Resolution" but not everything has a big jump, some games only saw a very small increase.</p>
<p>Lots more in their progress report like a reduction in stuttering with more optimization work going into the Ubershaders system, improvements to their FPS counter, an Android GUI refresh and so on.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader makes Steam Deck plugins even EASIER with new installer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Decky Loader is a project I've covered before multiple times now because it can add a lot to the Steam Deck with plugins, and now it's even easier to use.</p>
<p>Until now, you've always needed to use the command-line terminal app Konsole to install it by pasting in a command to grab it. However from version v2.4.8 onwards that released a few days ago, it now has an easy download that will give you a little UI for installing it, and if you don't have an admin password set it can even do a temporary one while it installs — clever stuff.</p>
<p>Take a quick look in my video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ujP6ZB0-eIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/672addaec553a4ff5c12bff8ffc6f566.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ujP6ZB0-eIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's amazing how the Steam Deck has built up this big community of hackers around it, making all sorts of useful additions. Like we've seen here with Decky Loader, it all gets easier over time too as more people contribute towards the projects. That's the power of open source in action.</p>

      <title>Valve adding a Steam feature for game transfers between PCs and Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something it seems Valve has been working on for a while now, is an easy way to transfer game installs between PCs and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>We've known about it since at least October last year, where the SteamDB founder Pavel Djundik talked about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1585700178480271378" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. However, in a follow-up post on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1611285970325839872" target="_blank">Twitter</a> just recently, Djundik mentioned more work on this has appeared recently with strings appearing that say "This feature allows your PC to transfer game files to and from other PCs or Steam Decks on your local network, reducing your Internet traffic while downloading or updating a game" and also noting that you can "Can limit to own devices, friends, or any user.".</p>
<p>Once actually out it would mean you don't need to re-download on other systems, or use the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4593-5CB7-DC3C-64F0" target="_blank">Steam Backup feature</a> (which doesn't always work right) along with some form of file syncing which I've done multiple guides on for Steam Deck including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-transfer-files-from-your-pc-to-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Warpinator</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/syncthing-is-a-great-way-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/transferring-files-from-pc-to-steam-deck-with-ftp/" target="_blank">Filezilla FTP</a>.</p>
<p>Sounds like an incredibly useful feature for Valve to add to Steam desktop and Steam Deck don't you think? Looking forward to giving that a test when it's available.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 20: The Antediluvian World</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-19-sinsational/" target="_blank">Part 19: SiNsational</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Atlantis: The Underwater City</em> is an animated film released in 2001 directed by Alessandro Bulath and distributed by Sterling Entertainment Group under their UAV brand. The cynic in me suspects the film was only produced to sow market confusion in the hope of cashing in on some of the hype surrounding the release of <em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire </em>that same year<em>,</em> which was a very common practice for budget animation studios during the Disney Renaissance.</p>
<p>Few of those knock off straight to video movies ever got the companion CD-ROM treatment, but it was quite common for legit Disney films to receive them at the time. Sold as interactive storybooks, these took the form of narrated picture books which went over the story from the film while allowing for a certain degree of user agency, typically by allowing a selection of quirky animations to play by clicking around with the mouse.</p>
<p>UAV must have wanted in on this craze as well, and so <em>Atlantis: The Underwater City - Interactive Storybook</em> was born. Even when compared to the source material it is clear that little effort was put into its production, with bare bones animation and crude art direction marring a title marketed as transporting children to a memorable fantasy world. About the only reason to save the software from the bargain bin that it was intended for is the boast of Linux support.</p>
<p>Inside the jewel case the booklet instructs Linux users to mount the CD-ROM, change to the directory, and then launch the Atlantis_for_Linux.sh shell script. This will probe for a number of common Linux web browsers of the time including Mozilla, Konqueror, Galeon, and Netscape, before attempting to launch the browser.html web page located on the root directory of the CD-ROM. A nice effort, but they could have just called the $BROWSER global variable instead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the developers forgot to specify the present working directory, leaving the script to just fall flat on its face. Adding $PWD in the path before invoking browser.html would have made all the difference, a flaw which should have been obvious long before they burned the shell script to the CD-ROM. Thankfully the README.html page does at least include a working link for launching on other computer systems such as Linux and BeOS, so that is something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13165353911672949546gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13165353911672949546gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10779695971672882248gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10779695971672882248gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <em>Interactive Storybook</em> functions through the magic of Macromedia Flash, which I installed for use with Mozilla using the flash-plugin-7.0.69-1.rh7.rf.i386.rpm package from freshrpms. This allowed the storybook portion to work, but some of the included minigames proved to have rendering errors, with the Atlantis Bricks and Atlantis Blocks games both being crippled to the point of being unplayable. I suspect this is due to incompatibilities between Flash versions.</p>
<p>Alongside Macromedia Flash the <em>Interactive Storybook</em> also depends on Apple QuickTime for playing the full movie, with it just being a dead link for me on Linux. Of course, there is nothing stopping you from searching the data directory on the CD-ROM for the atlantis.mov file and playing that through your favourite Linux movie player of choice. The README.html page suggests using XAnim but I settled for watching the bitcrushed file through MPlayer instead.</p>
<p>At this point, playing the <em>Interactive Storybook</em> on Linux is not far removed from having no support for the platform at all. While it is nice that they acknowledged that everything they were doing could in theory be done on Linux, very little effort was put into making it be a smooth experience in practice. I am reminded of the demands by some to have more DOSBox wrappers available for Linux on storefronts, when without proper care they could easily wind up being like this.</p>
<p>Having now gone to the trouble of finding and installing Macromedia Flash on Red Hat Linux 7.3 it might be an idea go back and explore some higher quality Flash games and amusements, as there are a number of them that I do have some actual nostalgic attachment towards. For the moment I think I have gotten my fill by messing about with this however, not helped by the fact Macromedia Flash runs a little heavy on Dianoga.</p>
<p>Although it appears to have never been mentioned on their website, the credits reveal that the developer of the <em>Interactive Storybook </em>was none other than BlackHoleSun Software, a familiar name to those in the Linux gaming scene at the time. As one of the first Indie studios to truly embrace cross-platform development, even the mention of BeOS in the README.html page makes a lot more sense now, given who we are dealing with.</p>

      <title>Multiplayer voxel RPG &#39;Veloren&#39; v0.14 out with musical instruments, more graphics work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Version 0.14 of the Multiplayer voxel RPG Veloren is out now, adding in some fun sounding additions while they work towards giving you more to do. It's still very much a sandbox right now, as a lot of the work going into Veloren is still building up the tech behind the game.</p>
<p>As for what it is and what it aims to be: it's inspired by the likes of Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft and mixes elements of all together but it's still early days. It's free, open source and supports Linux. Promising, but still needs some more <em>stuff and things</em> for players to actually experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9565751471673277433gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9565751471673277433gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a Craft All button and new recipes.</li>
<li>Musical instruments can now be crafted, looted and played.</li>
<li>Pets can now be traded with.</li>
<li>Added redwood and dead trees.</li>
<li>SeaChapel, greek/latin inspired dungeon for ocean biome coasts.</li>
<li>Doors now animate opening when entities are near them.</li>
<li>Added screen-space reflection and refraction shaders.</li>
<li>Added reflection quality setting.</li>

      <title>Pixel-art RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent adds neutral settlements and unit stances</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What might seem like a pixel-art Age of Empires on the surface, the RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent is much more than that and they recently released a major update for the game. It's currently in Early Access with this latest update being the second major milestone for the game.</p>
<p>This update was released last month and added into the game neutral settlements, giving you and your opponents more to fight over as gaining control of them will give you various bonuses. Sounds like a fun addition to fight for control of the map and get going early on. Nice to see a bit more depth to it.</p>
<p>You can also set your people across three different stances now including holding ground, being defensive or aggressive. On top of that some of the UI was reworked to be less confusing, enemy AI improvements and various smaller improvements for this RTS gem.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and it has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio recording software v29.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio, the very useful and popular recording and livestream software has a new release available with <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/29.0.0" target="_blank">version 29.0</a> out now. As usual there's plenty of features that only currently work on Windows, some that will hopefully come to Linux eventually when OBS have people to work on them.</p>
<p>Some of the new features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the AMD AV1 Encoder for the RX7000 series GPUs on Windows.</li>
<li>Added support for the Intel AV1 Encoder for Arc GPUs on Windows.
<ul>
<li>Note: CQP is available but not fully supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for the Intel HEVC Encoder on Windows.</li>
<li>Added an upward compressor filter.</li>
<li>Added a 3-band equalizer filter.</li>
<li>Added support for native HEVC and ProRes encoders on macOS, including P010 and HDR.</li>
<li>Added support for macOS Desk View.</li>
<li>Added update channels for opting into receiving beta/release-candidate builds to Windows.
<ul>
<li>Work is still underway to get everything ready on the server side, updating via the built-in updater may not be available until later in the OBS 30.0 beta-testing period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Websockets updated to 5.1.0, which has a number of bug fixes, UI improvements, and new stream reconnect events.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15644620271673272338gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15644620271673272338gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>OBS Studio v29.0 capturing a Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Some other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Replay Buffer's memory limit is now set to 75% of installed system RAM rather than fixed to 8GB.</li>
<li>Added media key support in Linux.</li>
<li>Various improvements to NVIDIA Video and Audio filters, including a Mask Refresh slider and support for temporal processing, which provides better quality masking.</li>
<li>Improved Display Capture screen naming &amp; saving on Windows; indexes should now match regardless of Mode, and reconnected displays should show the correct monitor.
<ul>
<li>Note: This does mean existing Display Capture sources will be blank until manually configured, to avoid showing the wrong display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for encryption and authentication for SRT and RIST outputs.</li>
<li>Disabled ScreenCaptureKit Display &amp; App capture on macOS 12 due to various issues; users should either update to macOS 13 or use the existing Screen Capture source.</li>
<li>Removed the automatic numbering on Multiview labels.</li>
<li>Added the ability to mute individual browser docks.</li>
<li>Added the ability to right click and 'Inspect' individual browser docks.</li>
<li>Changed the default Simple Output NVENC preset to P5 for better compatibility &amp; performance.</li>
<li>Added support for higher refresh rates in the Video Capture Device source on Windows.</li>
<li>Added the Apple VT Hardware encoder to the Auto Configuration Wizard.</li>
<li>Improved FFmpeg VA-API enablement by directly using Libva to check device capabilities.</li>
<li>Various minor UX/accessibility tweaks in the UI.</li>
<li>Raised the speed at which dynamic bitrate recovers after a drop.</li>
<li>Audio should now be automatically captured for most capture card brands using the Video Capture Device source on Windows.</li>
<li>Added a slide counter to the Source Toolbar when an Image Slide Show is selected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On a personal note, I'm hoping this release will fix an audio bug I've been hitting recently where everything is fine for me with game captures looking great and for me sounding good, but the recording has audio that just constantly stutters. It's been a problem for a while, and has made quite a few of my recordings unusable. If you've encountered it and know a fix, do let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>I also seem to have to do a weird little dance with my capture card recently. A first load of OBS never seems to have it working. Sometimes I have to unplug the capture card and plug it back in for OBS to see it properly — it's been getting quite annoying but it could also be Fedora-specific issues with V4L2.</p>

      <title>Developer of No Man&#39;s Sky put up their old Joe Danger playable in your browser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Joe Danger was the first commercial game release from No Man's Sky developer Hello Games, and as part of keeping it alive they've put it up online free to play in your browser.</p>
<p>You get to play with Joe Danger Touch and Infinity with "improved visuals, on Mac/PC/Chrome/Linux, dynamic resolution, mouse and keyboard support" according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1611321944472956928" target="_blank">Twitter</a> announcement.</p>
<p>Last year they revived the classic for the Apple App Store after noting an email they received from the mother of a child with Autism about it who loved it, and so now they're doing the same for PC players and in an expanded tweet they said: "It's sad that many games slowly die, and we've been trying to think of a way to let Joe live on forever, and reach the most people possible. This is hopefully one way of doing that. We owe this and more to him.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11180323931673270978gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11180323931673270978gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>You can play it online <a href="https://joedangerthegame.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another way developers can keep old games alive is by open sourcing them, especially if they no longer plan to sell them, or even if they do want to continue selling them they can just open up the game code. Hopefully over time more will do that.</p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead from Valve has a prototype leaked online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tis the season of leakage apparently. Seems a prototype of Left 4 Dead 2 has made its way online and you can even try it.</p>
<p>Available on the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/420879" target="_blank">GameBanana</a> modding platform for Counter-Strike: Source, Zombie City was apparently created by either Valve or Turtle Rock Studios and was part of a map sources folder leak that went out and seemingly the starting point of Left 4 Dead going by the name of Terror-Strike.</p>
<p>The modder who uploaded it mentioned they did some tweaks to make it more playable like texture fixes. </p>
<p>While it obviously doesn't compare with the real finished product or the sequel, it's always fun to see what the early prototype versions looked like so we can get a small glimpse behind the development curtain. Some footage on it you can find below:</p>

      <title>Steam breaks more records with 33 million online, and over 10 million gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve started the year off rather nicely by breaking two of their own records recently with users online and users actually gaming.</p>
<p>They have a new all-time peak for concurrent online users as 33,078,963 and 10,284,568 playing games. This is only the second time we've seen over 10 million people in-game, the first being the day before on January 7th but these numbers from January 8th are the new records as shown by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>The current top 5 most played games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</li>
<li>Dota 2.</li>
<li>Goose Goose Duck.</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS.</li>
<li>Apex Legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Goose Goose Duck the social deduction game (that takes a look of inspiration <em>directly</em> from Among Us) being a complete newcomer releasing in October last year, and suddenly seeing the player count rise from late November where it went up like a rocket to see a 24 hour peak of 640,324. It being free to play probably helps a lot, and it runs on Linux with Proton.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated and Proton Next (7.0-6) out for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first Proton Experimental update of 2023 from Valve has landed for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, plus Proton Next is live again with the upcoming release of Proton 7.0-6.</p>
<p>Firstly the Proton Experimental update that landed January 6th: a newly playable title with this update is Gungrave G.O.R.E., a third-person action shooter by South-Korean Studio IGGYMOB. It also comes with these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Life is Strange Remastered crashing at the end of chapter 2.</li>
<li>Fix Alt+Tab not working on Gnome 43.</li>
<li>Improve force feedback compatibility for BeamNG and Forza Horizon 5.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bigger one of course is Proton Next. Valve had a Release Candidate for Proton 7.0-6 available in early December 2022, with it now moving to Proton Next. This makes it easier to test, as you can set games to use Proton Next to test, which won't mess with any on the current main Proton release which is 7.0-5.</p>
<p>With Proton Next (7.0-6) these are newly playable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gotham Knights.</li>
<li>UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection.</li>
<li>Heroes of the Dark.</li>
<li>Super Arcade Racing.</li>
<li>Crazy Machines 3.</li>
<li>King under the Mountain.</li>
<li>NinNinDays2.</li>
<li>雀姬 (Mahjong ladies).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All the fixes in Proton Next (7.0-6):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Septerra Core hanging on redistributables installation.</li>
<li>Fix Persona 5 Royal crashing when creating game save data.</li>
<li>Fix Vampire Survivors intermittent error message.</li>
<li>Fix Super House of Dead Ninjas, Enemy Mind, and Out There Somewhere frame hitching every few seconds.</li>
<li>Fix Zeepkist freezing when using controller.</li>
<li>Fix Overcooked! All You Can Eat being unable to add a second controller-using player.</li>
<li>Fix Quake III: Arena and Quake III: Team Arena displaying weird texture over the menu.</li>
<li>Fix the new EA launcher displaying a blank window.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel Snap not being able connect to online services.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator crashing during longer flights.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not displaying live traffic.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not starting after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator crashing when starting next to big cities.</li>
<li>Fix Sackboy: A Big Adventure failing to start the first time it's launched.</li>
<li>Fix Spyro Reignited Trilogy playing intro video in a wrong language.</li>
<li>Fix Jurassic World Evolution 2 bad performance with recent Proton versions.</li>
<li>Fix multiple monitor support in Project Cars 2 and Project Cars 3.</li>
<li>Fix Korean not being rendered correctly in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII launcher.</li>
<li>Fix multiple languages not rendering correctly in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.</li>
<li>Fix Lost Lands: Dark Overlord, Lost Lands: Dark Lord, Lost Lands: Redemption, and Haunted Hotel: Silent Waters Collector's Edition crashing when trying to set a wallpaper.</li>
<li>Fix video playback regression with Chronos: Before the Ashes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the other improvements in Proton Next (7.0-6):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve video playback with OUTRIDERS and ToGather: Island.</li>
<li>Update wine-mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-7.4.0" target="_blank">7.4.0</a>.</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi to <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.6" target="_blank">v0.6</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>ASUS stick an OLED display into a controller, Dell want to reinvent it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new real controller from ASUS is on the way with the ROG Raikiri Pro that features an OLED display, plus Dell get weird with the Concept Nyx from CES 2023.</p>
<p>Let's start with the real stuff shall we? ASUS have made the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/controllers/rog-raikiri-pro-model/" target="_blank">ROG Raikiri Pro</a>, while it's for Xbox you know how it goes — Linux ends up supporting it anyway (and Steam Input no doubt will too). This has a built-in OLED display for some reason, with customizable animations, status indicators and more. It can also connect via USB-C, 2.4 GHz RF or Bluetooth, multiple buttons on the back and triggers that can have the triggers with short or full range modes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18168874211673020319gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18168874211673020319gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Could be quite interesting? Although all the special extras would no doubt need someone to come up with a way to do it all on Linux too.</p>
<p>Then we have the really weird with the <a href="https://dell.alienwarearena.com/leveling-up-concept-nyx-with-new-controller-concept-and-game-changing-enhancements/" target="_blank">Dell Concept Nyx</a>. It's not actually a real thing, although they have made and shown off some prototypes at CES. This is not really a controller you would use with a normal PC or even on another console, as it's designed to go along with the whole <a href="https://dell.alienwarearena.com/concept-nyx/" target="_blank">Concept Nyx system</a> which is sort-of like a shared server that does everything for multiple people across different screens.</p>
<p>With the Concept Nyx Game Controller they added a finger print sensor to the middle of it, added dual-thumb scroll wheels to the bottom of it, put some paddles on the back and replaced the D-pad with what they call an Omnipad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2989209361673021098gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2989209361673021098gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4981465201673021111gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4981465201673021111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the finger print reader, they suggest it's a way for it to quickly read your print and load everything up. Not exactly wild, since finger print readers exist for PC right now but on a controller to quickly get you into something when sharing the same controller with others? Interesting.</p>
<p>Dell also said they're experiment with "haptics and self-adjusting variable resistance thumb sticks" that can be adjusted to your liking, or be specific to each game. The touch pad sounds a little bit more like what we've seen on the Steam Deck, giving you access to a lot more options that can be configured.</p>
<p>The way they talk about it honestly makes it sound like something from a sci-fi film, with it being able to do entirely unique split-screen modes with each side having a different game and more. Sounds like something that in reality, will never become a real product, at least not any time soon.</p>

      <title>Google open sourced CDC File Transfer from the ashes of Stadia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Google hover over the nuke from orbit button on Stadia, they're at least releasing some of it as open source like CDC File Transfer.</p>
<p>Noted on their <a href="https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>, it's a way for syncing and streaming files from Windows to Linux. The question is: why another way to sync files? There's tons of ways that already exist. Well, they explained that too.</p>
<p>Developers could use scp, but they noted it was "impractical" especially with more people working from home as it "always copies full files". So they made cdc_rsync and cdc_stream to help developers who quickly iterate on games. Something that could potentially be useful for developers checking out stuff on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>CDC RSync is designed for syncing files from Windows to Linux but optimized for existing files possibly being on the end machine. They go into detail on why and how it's different to rsync, including showing it performing better for this specific case because of how they split up files into chunks differently at variable sizes. While CDC Stream is for streaming files from Windows to Linux, they say it's "conceptually" similar to sshfs but "optimized for read speed".</p>
<p><em>For anyone interested in trying it out, they provide release builds for Ubuntu.</em></p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors dev poncle outlines 2023 plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors, probably the most popular game on Steam Deck that keeps being top of the most played list, is set for a busy 2023.</p>
<p>In an overview post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3637250052875666496" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developer goes on talk about why the big game engine port upgrade didn't happen last year. Part of that was due to the mobile release, with many full clones appearing "with stolen code, assets, data, progression" that forced their hand. They also struggled to find a partner for the release who liked their non-predatory monetization model for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aS7JqyHdQQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b0d16ad23a843acd6bd4e927d422e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aS7JqyHdQQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One point they mentioned about the new upcoming game engine port, is that they need to develop a little launcher to let you pick what version to load with what options. Steam Deck was mentioned here as a potential challenge, as they naturally want to keep it working nicely. They <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> this is where a proper new Native Linux port will happen too (it has one now although not advertised and not fully supported).</p>
<p><em>Side-note: if they just want a way to switch between the old and new, Steam has a built-in launch option feature for that.</em></p>
<p>Work continues on the port though, with plenty of things still needed to be done in the new version, and support for the existing game built on JavaScript will continue. Eventually they will fully move everything and everyone to the new version though. One of their big problems seems to be physics, where it behaved very differently so they had to start over on some parts of it.</p>
<p>They also plan to make more content DLC, given how the first had such a great reception and they're also working on things not related to Vampire Survivors now too.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake due to release in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios have now set a launch window for System Shock, with it planned to release in March. That's if it doesn't see yet another delay.</p>
<p>Shared in an update on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/3699917" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they said: "After our return from Gamescom we’ve been hesitant to share anything so as not to spoil any remaining surprises we have in store. However, we’ve picked a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March, 2023.".</p>
<p>Not the first time of course they've announced something, which they touched on and mentioned how the scope and scale of it has changed and with Prime Matter joining them as publisher it's helped them to focus on  "quality-of-life improvements, bug fixing, and localization support" which are the last steps towards the release. They also said they're "incredibly proud" of what they've done.</p>
<p>In the post they also shared a few more small clips and art.</p>
<p>This was the last full proper teaser from 6 months ago:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n2b1zQkYsyM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88798b17fd085590a77bb652a5f02089.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n2b1zQkYsyM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As far as I can see, they've still been pretty silent about the Native Linux support that was mentioned on the original crowdfunding campaign. A lot has changed since then though. Hopefully it will work okay in Proton if they're no longer doing that.</p>

      <title>Batman Rogue City is a fun looking GZDoom fan game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun retro fan game for you! Batman Rogue City released in December for GZDoom and looks like a criminal-kicking good time. As a fan game, it of course has nothing to do with DC Comics but you know what these big companies can be like, they might get itchy fingers over someone using their names and designs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/batman-rogue-city" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a> doesn't really give it much of a description, but a nice touch is a full PDF manual included with the download that expands on the story and more.</p>
<p>It has over 30 villains and their henchmen, 8 action-packed levels, 8 weapons, and you even get to ride in the Batmobile.</p>

<p>Think I'm going to have fun with this one…</p>
<p>Seems to work fine on Linux, with the Flatpak version of GZDoom and putting the .pk3 file in the right place running this command launched it just fine:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file /home/liam/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/BatmodRaycastRCv2.pk3</code></p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update, plus easy Flatpak updates and more HDR teasing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three fun bits for you today including Steam desktop and Steam Deck Beta updates, an easy way to update third-party Flatpaks on Steam Deck in Gaming Mode and another HDR teaser from Valve.</p>
<p>Here's a video overview going over all of it, with the plain details below the video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZhtK92WNJZs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac462d68323d110bfeecee053d741557.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZhtK92WNJZs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Firstly, the Beta updates for Steam desktop and Steam Deck starting with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449571615797" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed reboot loop when failing to update a broken Steam install</li>
<li>Changed selected launch option reminder to show three times per user instead of continuing to show every time the user returns to the game details.</li>
<li>Fixed issues w/ digital navigation getting stuck on text boxes when using a physical keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue viewing the hardware survey web page after submitting results</li>
<li>Added option to turn off controllers when exiting BPM</li>
<li>Implemented Steam Controller dongle pairing</li>
<li>Added controller setting dropdown for controller idle turn off timeout</li>
<li>Prevented launch option reminder from appearing on top of other UI while a game is launching</li>
<li>UI Digital Navigation Key Repeats are faster</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the ThrustMaster eSwap PRO Controller Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed long delay at startup when Razer keyboards are connected</li>
<li>Show controller settings in app properties game for non-Steam games</li>
<li>Fixed crash with games that use "Windows Gaming Input"</li>
<li>Gyro Calibration Rework: Calibration Calculates an anti-drift value as normal, but also records Gyro and Accelerometer noise while stationary, so that Auto Calibration (toggle) is more discerning</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix instances of Steam freezing or crashing in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fix closing non-steam shortcuts via the overlay when two or more are running.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The desktop Steam Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3653013849007354968" target="_blank">update</a> is largely the same, except for a note about it fixing an issue with "duplicate streaming dialogs appearing on Mac &amp; Linux". However, as shown in my video, the new controller options don't actually show up on Steam Deck, only on desktop PCs.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck owners who have installed third-party software in desktop mode via the Discover app, there's an easy way to get Gaming Mode to run updates for those Flatpak packages using <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> thanks to the Flatpak Updates plugin. How to actually use Decky Loader and the Flatpak Updater plugin is noted in the above video, with the plain instructions on the Decky Loader link. I do love all these plugins — so useful!</p>

<p>Finally, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais gave another teaser on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1611149273894387715/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in regards to HDR support noting: "HDR working on a docked Deck connected to a current-gen LG OLED through HDMI! Again still needs a ton of work but making good progress.", with this shot included:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver v525.78.01 out fixing bugs and supports RTX 4070 Ti</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/198295/en-uk" target="_blank">525.78.01</a> for Linux which includes support for the new RTX 4070 Ti, along with a few select bug fixes. Not that you would want to buy an RTX 4070 Ti, since it's ridiculous for the price.</p>
<p>Apart from supporting the new GPU here's the fixes listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when using a newer control panel with an older driver.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented the G-SYNC/G-SYNC Compatible Visual Indicator from being displayed when running Vulkan X11 applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where usage of VK_KHR_present_id could cause applications to crash with Xid 32 errors.</li>
<li>Fixed excess CPU usage in hybrid graphics configurations where an external display is connected to an NVIDIA discrete GPU and configured as a PRIME Display Offload sink (also known as "Reverse Prime").</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's listed as a stable driver, so you should be fine to upgrade to it. They don't specifically mention the 4070 Ti in the changelog but it's clearly listed in the Supported Products tab on the driver page.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking to get a new GPU soon? If so let me know in the comments what you're going for any why.</em></p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 hits a big milestone with all games now bootable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a> is a free and open source PlayStation 3 emulator, and they hit a huge milestone for compatibility recently.</p>
<p>While they don't have any recent blog posts, they did take to <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1607123433506177025" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to announce that the "Loadable" category has hit zero games. This means that all games can at least boot up now, although there's still a fair few that will display an image but don't make it past the menus although that list is short too at only 2.56% of the overall library they're tracking. They're also tracking 28.96% noted as only just able to get in-game but have issues preventing them being fully playable (performance, bugs etc).</p>
<p>A long road and emulator development is certainly challenging, great to see it continue on though.</p>
<p>Their latest video from a few months ago showed off MotorStorm Pacific Rift now being playable:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xUpw9bHmoac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a922ae5f9aac15b6a00a16ae4cd5b2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xUpw9bHmoac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Despite what the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and most notoriously Nintendo think of emulation outside of their own stores (which are often sorely lacking) — it's vital for preservation. </p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress hit nearly half a million sales in December 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress from developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games finally had the Steam release in December 2022, and it seems like it went very well. It's currently sat with an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating from over 15,000 Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>On their official forum where they give out monthly statements, they confirmed in the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=181050.0" target="_blank">January Report</a> that "the game sold almost half a million copies in December, which is awesome" although they won't have all the specific on it until "mid-February" when all the processing is done.</p>
<p>They do plan to provide a Native Linux version at some point, although it works just fine with Proton right now. They also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3625992251197549466" target="_blank">announced</a> recently that they've hired a second programmer, which is a "historic moment" for the game for someone else to see the code and they're bringing in a long-time member of the DF community for this. In their January Report, they mentioned the newcomer will help towards "bug fixes, ports, and more".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>That's quite a lot to take in and those new desktop X3D have my mouth watering a bit. I only upgraded to a 5800X in the last year, I don't exactly need another upgrade but gosh they sound great. I need a PSU and GPU update next though…</p>
<p><em>Will you be looking to grab any of these? Do let me know in the comments.</em></p>
<p>You can see the full event video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OMxU4BDIm4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7fa64353193f6ade75b6704f39eb167e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OMxU4BDIm4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is also probably a good place to note that AMD have confirmed overheating and thermal throttling issues with their new Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which YouTuber <em>der8auer</em> has been detailing across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Lxydc-3K8" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxaDZ6n2MNo" target="_blank">videos</a>. The issue affects AMD's reference cards, not the ones designed by their partners. The statement AMD released:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working to determine the root cause of the unexpected throttling experienced by some while using the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards made by AMD. Based on our observations to-date, we believe the issue relates to the thermal solution used in the AMD reference design and appears to be present in a limited number of the cards sold. We are committed to solving this issue for impacted cards.</p>

      <title>Indie game character filled platform-battler &#39;Fraymakers&#39; arrives January 18th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful Kickstarter back in 2020, Fraymakers is getting set to hit Early Access on January 18th. Developed by McLeodGaming, who also made Super Smash Flash 2, a very popular Smash Bros fangame.</p>
<p>It's going to be launching with 4 playable characters, 20 assists, 5 stages, rollback netcode and their "FrayTools" which will allow people to make extra content for the game like characters, stages and so on for mods. Naturally more will be added officially during Early Access as they plan to have a lot more of everything and they expect it to remain in development for at least two years.</p>
<p>They don't really have an up to date gameplay trailer, although they do have these two from a few months ago that announced certain characters appearing:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hcrdQtIEpgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce4a2cf36365d18f90d6efa667039ee7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hcrdQtIEpgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aI5nOiKyI2Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47b3ee13ea542be1193820e137dfe7e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aI5nOiKyI2Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> - Fraymakers is designed to be friendly to new players and challenging and expressive for veteran players. You’re going to have a ton of fun whether you want a quick round with your friends or you’re looking to climb the leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback Netcode</strong> - If you’ve been part of the fighting game community over the past few years, you know that rollback is the gold standard for fighting game netcode. We’ve prioritized and designed around rollback from the outset of development, meaning that Fraymakers will provide the smoothest possible online experience.</li>
<li><strong>Full Movesets</strong> - With over 80 animations per character, we've skipped nothing! Each character comes complete with every motion and attack you've come to expect from a platform fighter as well as some brand new techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Assists</strong> - Choose from a massive selection of indie characters to unleash an attack, fire a projectile, buff your character, or inflict a special status effect on your foes.</li>
<li><strong>...And Infinite Expandability!</strong> - We designed both the game and our custom content editor to be accessible and powerful. We want the process of creating your own content to be simple and fun. Whether you're a player or a creator, this means that the possibilities are endless.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Beyond All Reason is looking incredible for fans of Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/" target="_blank">Beyond All Reason</a> is an in-development free and open source RTS, based on the <a href="https://springrts.com/" target="_blank">SpringRTS</a> game engine and their latest update showcases just how great it looks.</p>
<p>As a primer: designed for fans of Total Annihilation (1997), Supreme Commander (2007) and Planetary Annihilation (2014). It takes on the legacy of Total Annihilation, being heavily based on Balanced Annihilation (which was originally a total conversion of the Uberhack TA mod) which is a SpringRTS engine game, and the Spring engine started off by just getting Total Annihilation into full 3D so there's a <em>lot</em> of history here. Everything about it has been remade from models to sounds to prevent any copyright issues while retaining the essence of Total Annihilation. Their plan is to <em>eventually</em> release it on Steam.</p>
<p>After a while of silence from the team working on it they've put up a new graphical showcase that includes a brand new lighting system, new textures for one of the factions, improved special effects, an improved ground scarring system to really show the destruction from battles, new death animations for units, a new fog system and the list goes on. Check it out in the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GEQmm4UhLAg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/805b1c3dcdf8fa5ec521c864d23e840f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GEQmm4UhLAg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When it finally releases properly, this could end up being one of the greatest free and open source games ever made, it's certainly looking the part and for fans of huge RTS games it's certainly exciting.</p>
<p>After giving it a run today, I have to admit my excitement level of this has just gone through the roof. The level of polish compared to when I last tried it has come along immeasurably. It feels good and it looks pretty incredible too even with a bunch of settings nowhere near the maximum they could be and it runs very smoothly too. You know something is good, when you go to check it works and take a few screenshots and end up going through an entire skirmish battle. The pathfinding still needs some work, with some units just trying to push through others but just — wow.</p>
<p>Some screenshots taken by me today (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14706931672840029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14706931672840029gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2524979041672839970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2524979041672839970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>You can try it right now too with their Alpha+ level downloads (Native Linux support) from either the <a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/download#How-To-Install" target="_blank">official site</a> or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/info.beyondallreason.bar" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. They're really keeping the classic RTS dream alive here. Don't pass up on this, very playable even though it's not technically release-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Update 05/01/23</strong> - I’ve been enjoying it so much i decided to do a video on it myself on Fedora and a bit in Steam Deck at the end. Have a look:</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the winners of the 2022 Steam Awards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The voting is over and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards" target="_blank">The Steam Awards 2022</a> winners have been announced, so here's a run over each of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Game of the Year: <strong>Elden Ring</strong></li>
<li>VR Games of the Year: <strong>Hitman 3</strong></li>
<li>Labor of Love: <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></li>
<li>Better with Friends: <strong>Raft</strong></li>
<li>Outstanding Visual Style: <strong>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong></li>
<li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <strong>Stray</strong></li>
<li>Best game you Suck At: <strong>Elden Ring</strong></li>
<li>Best Soundtrack: <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></li>
<li>Outstanding Story-rich Game: <strong>God of War</strong></li>
<li>Sit back and Relax:<strong> LEGO STAR WARS: The Skywalker Saga</strong></li>
<li>Best game on the go: <strong>Death Stranding Director's Cut</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think of the winners of each category? It's a typical popularity contest, with those that have the biggest names and the most screen-time ending up winning. I definitely don't agree with some of them to be sure, although all the winners are arguably good games anyway.</p>
<p>The one that confuses me is Death Stranding Director's Cut for on the go, as the performance across two different Steam Decks for me is not great. Every BT encounter drops it way below 30, as does open world exploration repeatedly dropping it no matter the settings used.</p>
<p>The Steam Winter Sale 2022 is also still on right now too until January 5, 2023 at 10am PST / 6pm UTC. So you can pick up some of those above with a pretty nice discount.</p>

      <title>Classic 1990s series Catacomb lives on with the CatacombGL source port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ArnoAnsems/CatacombGL" target="_blank">CatacombGL</a> is an open source project to run Catacomb 3D (1991), The Catacomb Abyss (1992), The Catacomb Armageddon (1992) and The Catacomb Apocalypse (1993).</p>
<p>Just recently the project had a 0.5.4 Beta release, which is the first to have Native Linux support, along with using the CMake system. It has been tested across Ubuntu, Mint and even on a RaspberryPi.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Main features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs native on Windows 7/8/10/11 and Linux.</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated 3D rendering via OpenGL, supporting widescreen resolutions, a customizable field of view and an uncapped frame rate.</li>
<li>Player, projectile and monster movement with floating point precision.</li>
<li>Configurable mouse and keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Supports all four Catacomb 3D games as included in the Catacombs Pack from GOG.com.</li>
<li>Supports The Catacomb Abyss version 1.13 (shareware).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Current limitations as of version 0.5.4:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No support for game controllers.</li>
<li>No backwards compatibility with saved games from the original DOS game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does require the original games, like a lot of open source game engine re-implementations. You can buy the whole pack legally thanks to <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/catacombs_pack" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4132502901672834103gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Never heard of the series? According to the GOG description: "Catacombs Pack is a fantastic compilation of the classic fantasy FPS series. Step into the shoes of one Pelton Everhail, the greatest of the living wizards. Discover secret, long-forgotten treasure troves as you blast away the walls with your powerful magicks. Explore twisting mazes filled with deadly traps and even deadlier denizens. Face Nemesis and fight for your life and those that depend on you. Enter the Catacombs, if you dare and witness the true roots of the First Person Shooter genre on the PC!"</p>

      <title>Space sci-fi 4x city-builder &#39;Antimatter&#39; gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Antimatter is a crowdfunded upcoming space sci-fi game that mixes together 4x strategy elements with city-building, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure how you would accurately describe this one. The scope of it is just massive and it looks like it's coming together quite nicely. Rather than focusing on graphics, the developer is firmly focusing on the depth of the gameplay. A work of passion from a solo developer that gained only €11,765 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geopi/antimatter-a-city-builder-and-4x-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> back in 2020.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v211Iv_D2dg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee92f918fcf88b35a580adfcdb63d3e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v211Iv_D2dg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of systems and planets to explore in a gigantic instantiated galaxy.</li>
<li>A dynamic universe where dozens of factions struggle for power or survival.</li>
<li>Take command of a spaceship, trade, mine, harvest, scavenge, produce and participate in the simulated economy.</li>
<li>Manage an existing city or found a new colony on any planet.</li>
<li>Climb the political ladder of a commercial corporation or a sovereign organisation, or found a new one from scratch.</li>
<li>Interact with AI characters who are living independant and simulated life in the Antimatter universe.</li>
<li>Terraform entire planets by altering their atmospheric compositions.</li>
<li>Fulfil missions for corporations, factions or individuals, or unravel the secrets of this galaxy.</li>
<li>Get involved in the Antimatter Crisis and try to change yourself the course of history.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I just hope the ambition here doesn't end up a little too much for one developer. Even in the trailer it shows off a ridiculous amount of unique things to do in the game. Then again, tiny teams and solo developers have repeatedly managed some incredibly impressive games over the last few years.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343010/Antimatter/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> and it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>AMD Ray Tracing on Linux gets closer with Mesa enabling specific games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work going into the open source Mesa graphics drivers continues on, with AMD Ray Tracing picking up speed and they're going to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20464" target="_blank">enable</a> Quake II RTX and Doom Eternal support by default now.</p>
<p>Currently you can turn it on manually, but now they're moving to add specific games known to work into a list. These two games are just the start. On the GitLab Merge Request, developer Bas Nieuwenhuizen <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20464#note_1700820" target="_blank">noted</a> in reply to a question on why just these and why not default for all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it is not ready, in particular we're missing Daniel's shader calling work and some more game debugging.<br/>
However, it feels worth it to start enabling some games we know to work, so that people can start playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work should be available in Mesa 23.0 due later this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2343847381672832865gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - DOOM Eternal.</em></p>
<p>It's nice to see some more movement on this, as it's been a long time coming for those sticking with the open source Mesa drivers.</p>

      <title>Starbreeze Studios announce PAYDAY 3 for this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Confirmed to be releasing later this year, Starbreeze Studios recently put up a teaser for PAYDAY 3. I'm sure many fans of the previous game will be excited it's back and coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> so even if it's not a Native release it should be easy enough to get going with Proton.</p>
<p>"Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement."</p>

<p>While they've not announced a date any clearer than "2023", we at least now know it takes place in New York and the developers confirmed it will use Unreal Engine, so the PC release should stay in sync with console versions they're also doing.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti launches January 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Very much as expected, NVIDIA at CES today announced the new NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti to launch on January 5th.</p>
<p>Technically, it's not really a new GPU is it? This is basically what the second model of the RTX 4080 was going to be with 7680 CUDA Cores and 12 GB of GDDR6X, before they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/nvidia-qunlaunchingq-the-rtx-4080-12gb-apparently-4090-ti-cancelled-due-to-melting/" target="_blank">unlaunched it</a>. At least this time it has a better name, and a lower price to match too at $799 / £799.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12171622781672765283gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12171622781672765283gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From what NVIDIA say, it will "max out" a 1440p monitor and it's apparently faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while also using less power. However, keep your pinch of salt at the ready until you see third-party benchmarks as this announcements are always cherry-picking data and NVIDIA don't even go into what settings where used and it's likely also making use of things like DLSS 3.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what they showed:</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1581245931672765180gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1581245931672765180gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>More on it in their <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-4070-ti/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4070ti/" target="_blank">product page</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel announces 13th Gen mobile processors, plus 65-watt and 35-watt desktop processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today Intel announced their new lineup on 13th Gen mobile processors including a 24-core beast and additionally some 65-watt and 35-watt desktop processors.</p>
<p>For the mobile processors they're split across three different series from top to bottom: Intel Core H-series focused on the high end, with the Intel Core P-series and U-series focused on thin and light laptops. Below you can see the overview of all the different models that have been announced split across each series, click the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19178256401672763505gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19178256401672763505gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/134315291672763507gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/134315291672763507gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14628713201672763507gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14628713201672763507gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13595611291672763508gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13595611291672763508gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They also announced a bunch more desktop processors in 65w and 35w variants completing the lineup for the 13th Gen Intel Core. Below is the overview on each of those. Click the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/132342001672763739gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/132342001672763739gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14568012331672763741gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14568012331672763741gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall it seems like a pretty solid lineup to compete with what AMD have been cooking up. Nice to see both sides continuing to push out decent processors, and the prices on them seem pretty reasonable too. At $196 for a 10 core CPU (6 P cores, 4 E cores) for the i5-13400F, seems like a good bet for those of you on a budget who don't need an integrated GPU.</p>
<p>Additionally they also announced the Intel Processor N-series aimed at entry-level mainstream uses where you don't need a whole lot of performance. These replace the Intel Pentium and Intel Celeron branding.</p>

      <title>Linux use overtakes macOS on the Stack Overflow Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is a fun statistic, it seems Linux has become a fair bit more popular than macOS on the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-operating-system" target="_blank">Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly for the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-op-sys" target="_blank">2021 data</a>, professional Linux use was at 25.17% and overall Linux use was 25.32%. At the time macOS was at 30.04% for professionals and 25.19% overall. This was from over 80,000 responses.</p>
<p>This year's survey had over 70,000 responses, and the results for 2022 show that 40.23% use Linux for personal use while 39.89% use it as a professional. Personal use for macOS was at 31.07% and professional use at 32.97%.</p>
<p>So it's worth pointing out that while yes Linux use has risen quite a bit above macOS, they also had seemingly less responses on the latest survey. Still interesting enough to highlight though especially with the total responses being a pretty great sample size overall. A fun point here as well though is that the survey also noted that 15% of the respondents use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) personally and 14.34% professionally.</p>
<p>Naturally Windows was on top both years but the gap is getting smaller overall for developers, meanwhile poor old BSD was noted to only have 1.47% personal use and 1.03% professional use.</p>

      <title>Valve dev teases HDR support for Linux Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of people noticed recently than a whole lot of working was going into the <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> project for HDR support, and now a Valve developer has teased trying it out. This has been a long time coming, with work needed to support it across multiple parts of the Linux stack but it's starting to get there now.</p>
<p>For those not aware, Gamescope is a micro-compositor that's used on the Steam Deck to display your games and it can also be used on desktop too. It gives you a whole lot of control over what games are doing, with lots of work from developer Joshua Ashton going in for HDR support.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1610200412854046720" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Linux gaming milestone: with the latest work from Josh Ashton, HDR can now be enabled for real games! Tested it tonight on my AMD desktop with Halo Infinite, Deep Rock Galactic, DEATH STRANDING DC. Very early and will still need some time to bake to be useful to most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffais showed these shots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2085823411672742026gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2085823411672742026gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673519671672742027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20673519671672742027gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9633386491672742027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9633386491672742027gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>An increasingly exciting time to be a Linux gaming fan and it looks like 2023 will be the year of HDR. As Griffais said though, there's a lot still to do and this is just the start of it actually working.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://landofkittens.social/objects/822e33d8-8aad-4977-9f16-33611f27ed1a" target="_blank">Fediverse account</a> developer Joshua Ashton also showed off more of Death Stranding with a HDR Heatmap.</p>

      <title>Latest Steam Survey sees a minor dip for Linux &amp; Steam Deck, still trending nicely overall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>December 2022 results are in for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> and overall the Linux share is down but the overall trend is still good. Initially the survey results released to some parts that looked off, but Valve seems to have now corrected it.</p>
<p>For December 2022 the Linux share was 1.38%, next to macOS at 2.48% and Windows at 96.15%.</p>
<p>From our own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> you can see the current trend, which still puts the overall Linux share remaining at a multi-year high but just down from the peak last month. Unless something drastic changes, we're still trending towards possibly seeing 2% by the middle of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19203672791672740605gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19203672791672740605gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Valve are at least finally showing more distributions in their dedicated Linux list, when filtering it over to their Linux page you will now see all these shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 24.07% -1.70%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 11.12% +0.23%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.16% -0.21%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.48% +0.66%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.40% -0.32%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.83% +0.12%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21 64 bit 3.67% -0.23%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Other 35.28% +1.47%</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by the combined stats, the Steam Deck GPU shows up at 0.33% overall on Steam, so we can still tell that the vast majority of people on Steam Deck are sticking with SteamOS too.</p>

<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-18-run-away-and-join-the-circus/" target="_blank">Part 18: Run Away and Join the Circus</a></strong></p>
<p>Given the the company's current focus, the name Hyperion Entertainment seems an odd fit for the modern maintainer of AmigaOS, betraying its earlier status as an Amiga focused video game porting house. Attracted by the apparent success of Loki Software, Hyperion Entertainment also decided to expand into the Linux market, porting three games to the platform. One of their ports, that of <em>SiN</em>, to this day remains from them an elusive Linux exclusive.</p>
<p>Being given only a limited physical release in Europe, the Linux version of <em>SiN</em> is almost impossible to find today, so I would like to thank Nickolas Grigoriadis for supplying me with a copy. First developed by Ritual Entertainment for release in 1998 <em>SiN</em> is an ambitious if adolescent first person shooter with pretensions towards being an immersive sim, with level design that allows for a number of branching paths and a great degree of interactivity.</p>
<p>Adolescent applying to both the content of <em>SiN</em>, with its ridiculous comic book plot carried by the bosom of its femme fatale antagonist, and to how well baked the final product is. Notorious for its bugs <em>SiN</em> can also just feel a bit of a mess, being a headache for completionists with its multiple conflicting objectives. <em>SiN</em> plays more as an overwrought <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> than something like <em>Deus Ex</em>, perhaps unsurprising given the input from the likes of Richard Grey and Charlie Wiederhold.</p>
<p>When the ingredients are fully cooked the game can be compelling, but you have to take the rough with the smooth. This also applies to the quality of the Linux port, with it being mercurial to get working. When I first installed the SiN demo on Red Hat Linux 7.3 it refused to recognize my libGL.so library, but in the year or so since it started working without a hitch. This carried over to when I installed the full version, but I still have no firm idea as to what changed.</p>
<p>SiN also has the most obnoxious retail key and disc checks of any Linux game I have encountered, with it just kicking you to the desktop with an stderr message when starting a new game if the CD-ROM is not mounted. Given how often the game crashed this did not fill me with confidence. In addition, I found that audio clips would cut each other off and would at times be distorted, with the worst offender for this being at the end of the optional "Missile Silo" level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9322435051670625057gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9322435051670625057gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11576918371670625283gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11576918371670625283gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>How much these problems had to do with the Linux port or the nature of <em>SiN</em> itself remains unclear, although I suspect it to be a combination of both. I found myself stuck for a time in that same level as it is the only instance in the whole campaign where the unadvertised inventory screen, accessible with the F11 key, is required in order to progress. <em>SiN</em> develops a habit of putting hurdles in your way, as an even more significant roadblock would arise from my going off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Since I had opted to destroy all the pumps in the optional "Geothermal Plant" level, this breaks the scripting when you are forced to go through the "Biomass Reclamation Center" later in the game, causing Darwin Chamber 3 in "Area 57" not to be accessible. Thankfully a fan patch exists to fix this specific issue, as otherwise I would have been forced to cheat, or load up a previous save and use the alternative path through the "Hidden Docks" instead.</p>
<p>This was followed by the next level "Xenomorphic Laboratory" producing broken save files, but once I got past this things proceeded fine up until the penultimate "Munt Phoenix" level. Here the scripting broke again, with the enemies standing stock still instead of attacking me, and mission critical items not spawning in. This I could resolve by just restarting the level, letting me go on to defeat the final boss, although the final MPEG cutscene aborted after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Performance wise Windows 98 averaged 40.7 FPS compared to 33.1 FPS under Linux using High settings, with both versions benefiting from turning Tessellation and Dynamic Lighting off. Doing so brought the Linux average up to 37.3 FPS, although this was still dwarfed by the 51.2 FPS seen on Windows 98 with the same settings. Windows benefits too by having access to the more polished <em>Wages of Sin</em> mission pack, which sadly was never ported over to Linux.</p>
<p>SiN would also later be adapted into an animated film, the inverse of what gave us the software I am to cover next. Plenty of games released for Linux could be considered adolescent or even childish, but software designed with actual children in mind can be few and far between, at least in the commercial or retail space. Time for some family friendly entertainment, even if I do come away from the experience questioning the sincerity of the publisher's intentions.</p>

      <title>What I want to see in 2023 for Linux, Gaming, Steam Deck and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The end of a year is a good time to sit, think and reflect on what a year it has been and what we hope 2023 will bring so here's some of what I want and what I think could happen.</p>
<p>I actually wrote a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist for the Steam Deck back in October</a>, and funnily enough pretty much every single point there is still valid right now. Some points have had minor work but most of it hasn't been touched. I hope Valve are reading, because all of those points are what I regularly see people moan and gripe about too.</p>
<p>What else though for the wider picture?</p>
<p>- <strong>Neon Prime</strong>. Come on Valve, we need a new game from you. A proper one, not another (while very cool) Aperture Desk Job. We had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" target="_blank">trademark registration for Neon Prime</a> and leaker / data miner Tyler McVicker thinks it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/neon-prime-from-valve-is-reportedly-a-third-person-shooter-close-to-release/" target="_blank">close to release</a>. What the heck is it? I'm overly keen to find out. With good cross-platform support across Linux desktop, Steam Deck and Windows it could be an easy hit if it's a good multiplayer game like it's expected to be.</p>
<p>- For publishers to actually stop forcing <strong>Launchers</strong> on us. Don't make me beg. Have you ever met someone who said "heck yeah, the EA App!" or "oh lovely, the 2K launcher" in any kind of serious way? No you haven't — no one has. They almost always add <em>nothing</em> of value, break things constantly (not just on Linux / Steam Deck) and they're just a great big nuisance. I would like for them to just go away, forever. Throw them in the bin. Get them in the sea, just far away from me.</p>
<p>- <strong>Valve Deckard</strong>. We know from a lot of details going out, that Valve seem to be working <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/looks-like-valve-are-gearing-up-for-a-new-vr-headset/" target="_blank">on a new VR HMD</a>, one that should be both portable and able to connect up to a PC. It will likely run Linux for the portable mode, hence all their work on Linux (not just for Steam Deck). Gimme. Seriously. The Valve Index is great, but it's also overly bulky and really Valve haven't actually done all that much with it, especially on the Linux side where they've seemingly <em>ignored</em> Index support for some time now and the experience is less than stellar. I have high hopes that the Deckard will be a big improvement in many ways.</p>
<p>- <strong>Steam Deck Refresh</strong>. Look, the Steam Deck is fantastic overall but it could be better. It's not time yet for a Steam Deck 2, Valve said it themselves that they want to keep the main internals (CPU/GPU) the same to have a good point for developers and gamers but they want to focus on the screen and battery life. So do it. Towards the end of 2023, I would be surprised if we didn't have a confirmation that a nice refresh was on the way for this. The battery life being the biggest gripe people seem to talk about would hopefully get wiped off the table. Having it a bit lighter somehow would be another great bit to focus on, to prevent that hand / wrist strain from longer sessions. I hope Valve keep focusing on improving the Steam Deck, and not entertain the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-steam-deck-really-doesnt-need-exclusives/" target="_blank">ridiculous idea of exclusive games</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Half-Life 3, Portal 3</strong>. I can dream can't I? Half-Life: Alyx was a true return to form for Valve games, and one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had but I want more! I need to find out what happens after [redacted]. Portal 3 would also be another great one, with the first two being some of my favourite puzzles games and even their own writers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/erik-wolpaw-to-valve-on-portal-3-we-should-just-do-it/" target="_blank">want to do a third</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>SteamOS 3</strong> public release. Perhaps another big turning point for Linux and Linux Gaming as a whole? I get comments asking me for info on this daily (no I really don't know). The Steam Deck has turned a great many heads to just how powerful and good Linux can be as a platform, and now it seems many more people want to try it but they're waiting for SteamOS 3 to be released. While I think people would be better off sticking to a proper desktop Linux distribution (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-best-linux-distribution-for-gaming-in-2023/" target="_blank">like Ubuntu</a>), SteamOS 3 on desktop could actually be quite interesting to see, and with it then being available to more hardware vendors, we could see a true explosion in gaming devices shipping with Linux. 2022 was the year of Linux Gaming thanks to the Steam Deck, perhaps 2023 will truly be the year of Linux on the desktop?</p>
<p>- More <strong>Linux Hardware Releases</strong>. The Steam Deck is great but we need <u>more</u>, and not just from Valve. More hardware shipping with Linux on it out of the box and properly supported. I've said time and time again, this is what we <em>need</em> to push Linux forward. You can have the best distributions around, the slickest desktop environments, it can truly send Windows packing but it's largely useless if it's not out there in the face of the masses on hardware. It needs to be an oven ready deal; people just need to get it and turn it on.</p>
<p>- For <strong>Linux to break 3%</strong> on the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey. I don't actually think this one is too big of an ask. It's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">trending towards</a> 2% by the middle of 2023, thanks to the Steam Deck shipping with SteamOS.</p>
<p>- <strong>Anti-cheat woes</strong>. We already have <em>Easy Anti-Cheat</em> and <em>BattlEye</em> supporting Linux and Proton (and so Steam Deck too), so it's largely down to game developers to hook up support and many just haven't bothered to do so. There's issues developers and publishers need to think on of course, like opening up a multiplayer game to more platforms that could <em>potentially</em> bring in more cheaters. Both Linux desktop and Steam Deck are a growing market (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">#2</a>) of players, that I truly hope the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-now-shipping-across-asia-plus-a-new-steam-deck-stable-client-update/" target="_blank">Steam Deck's expansion into Asia</a> becomes a turning point on this so that it can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>- More open source from <strong>NVIDIA</strong>. In 2022 we had quite a surprise, with NVIDIA <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">opening up their kernel modules</a> and it would be great to see even more like this. They've made a good start and I hope to see them keep pushing. NVIDIA proprietary drivers are a constant nuisance and source of many annoyances for me over the past few years. I would already be on an AMD GPU by now, if <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1603073266364579842" target="_blank">OverclockersUK didn't oversell</a> at the 7900 XTX launch.</p>
<p>- <strong>GOG Galaxy</strong> and <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> on Linux — officially. Yeah yeah, Steam is great and all but options are better for consumers as a whole. Wine / Proton development has helped firmly bridge the gap of getting games working on Linux, now we need the other stores to follow along but this is the biggest ask, much more of a dream than any of the previous.</p>
<p><em>What do you want to see throughout 2023?</em></p>
