      <title>Smash some balls on the go as BALL x PIT is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BALL x PIT is a ball-smashing brick-breaking action-packed roguelite that's releasing in October and it's now Steam Deck Verified. From Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital, this is one of the most promising games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/ball-x-pit-is-a-delicious-challenge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I tested during a previous Steam Next Fest</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam announcement, they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/541117828155048579" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that BALL x PIT is now Steam Deck Verified: "We’ve got some cool news to share: BALL x PIT will be Steam Deck Verified at launch on October 15! That means the game runs smoothly, looks great, and fully supports the Steam Deck’s built-in controls and screen. So yes, you can now take the balls anywhere. And we really hope you do".</p>
<p>It was popular, with it being the 12th most played game in June's Steam Next Fest. BALL x PIT sees you batter hordes of enemies with a barrage of projectiles that can be evolved, upgraded and combined to create all manner of overpowered synergies. Gather the riches of the pit to expand your homestead, generate resources and recruit unique heroes.</p>

<p>The status isn't live on the Steam page yet, but developers get notice before it goes public. So soon the Steam page will note it also.</p>
<p>A demo is still up so you can try it right now. The game releases October 15th.</p>
<p><em>I have a key for it ready to review, so expect some proper thoughts sometime around the release.</em></p>

      <title>Mala Petaka is another action-packed GZDoom boomer shooter now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love retro boomer shooters and need another to add to your list? Mala Petaka has just arrived on Steam and it's rather colourful. This might be one of the most colourful shooters I've seen in a long time.</p>
<p>More about it: "You play as 'Petaka', an angry amnesiac that's on a journey to revive his memory by exploring multiple universes through warp portal technology. His journey won't be easy because he'll encounter many one-eyed aliens and annoying drones that'll attack him."</p>

      <title>Saveseeker is an upcoming time-travelling RPG with a twist</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In Saveseeker you're an eight year old time-travelling girl on a quest to stop her former Hero father from using his powers to destroy the world. Quite a fun sounding premise with this, and there's a demo available right now. It doesn't support controller yet, but the developer has confirmed they plan to add support later.</p>
<p>Playing as the young Emmer Edette, you have inherited your father's unique ability to <em>save</em> moments in time. But this once-heroic gift has been corrupted — Emmer's father, a legendary Hero, now uses his powers for destructive ends. With her grumpy toy dragon companion, Tippleton, Emmer must journey across six distinct lands, overwrite every "Save Stop" her father left behind, and face him in a final showdown.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G90C7nUKh88"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb8a00b0be92ed3a924f8428b0ee6f0a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G90C7nUKh88" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A quest that begins at the end</strong> – Step into a world forever changed by a legendary Hero. Travel across six distinct lands, reclaim corrupted “Save Stops,” and uncover the truth behind your father’s downfall before his misuse of power brings everything to ruin.</li>
<li><strong>Unlikely allies with their own agendas</strong> – Recruit five of the Hero’s defeated foes, brought to life with beautiful Ghibli-esque character design. Each ex-boss brings unique abilities and personalities to your party. Discover their motivations, combine their skills in battle, and see how old enemies can become indispensable friends.</li>
<li><strong>Time-bending turn-based combat</strong> – Emmer’s inherited power to “save” time adds a fresh twist to classic RPG combat. Rewind to rethink your strategy, set up powerful combos, and turn the tide against enemies that demand more than brute strength.</li>
<li><strong>Worlds full of character and challenge</strong> – Explore beautifully animated pixel-art worlds, from the shadowy Badwoods to the mechanical marvel of the airship Aertemis. Each setting is packed with puzzles, enemies, and secrets tailored to its unique atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Secrets and surprises around every corner</strong> – Venture off the main path to play minigames, uncover hidden lore, and earn powerful equipment. Every discovery adds more depth to Emmer’s journey and rewards those who take time to explore.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really do love the setting and style in this one. Playable on Linux with Proton. The full game launches sometime in 2026 with no set date announced yet.</p>

      <title>System76 COSMIC desktop Beta and Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two huge bits of news from System76, as they've released a Beta for both the new COSMIC desktop and Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS bringing lots of goodies.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting how System76 develop their own hardware, and run their own Linux distribution and now they're firmly getting into the Desktop Environment game with COSMIC designed for other vendors (distros and other organisations) to customize it. The official <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">COSMIC page</a> notes how it's "Best for users, best for your product" with the customization it allows.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>System76 has been building COSMIC to propel the Linux desktop to new heights of user empowerment. It will replace their custom version of the GNOME DE on Pop!_OS to reimagine the desktop environment and the value it provides. Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with COSMIC includes a custom theming system, customizable panels UI, enhanced workspaces system, streamlined tiling and keyboard shortcuts, and new core apps.</p>
<p>COSMIC is about empowering users to easily create their preferred workflow, emphasizing customizability to create the best, most consistent and flexible experience available. System76 understands that users know best how to use their computer for success. By enabling their personal preferences, they can remove obstacles to focus and empower themselves to unleash their potential.</p>
<p>With COSMIC, users can make their UI single- or dual-panel, workspaces horizontal or vertical, tiled or floating, dynamic or pinned (static), add new keyboard shortcuts, change Caps Lock, arrange applets (features on panels), create and share themes, and even add custom fonts or icons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It comes with a bunch of the expected core desktop applications designed for COSMIC including COSMIC Settings, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Store, COSMIC Terminal, COSMIC Edit, and COSMIC Player. More COSMIC apps can be found in the Store's Explore page in the Made For COSMIC section.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15838417861758880427gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15838417861758880427gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1004205891758880428gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1004205891758880428gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>System76 are keen to talk up how they built it with Rust, from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COSMIC is written from scratch in Rust, a programming language System76 engineers loved working with for its readability, stability, maintainability, and memory safety; many modern computer vulnerabilities happen in the system’s memory, and Rust makes it easy to write memory-safe code. As a newer language, this required a lot of groundwork in building the fundamental capability to create a desktop environment in the first place. System76 needed to build a complete toolkit of high-level components with deep platform integration, all designed to create a consistent look and feel for the COSMIC desktop environment. That effort resulted in the libcosmic toolkit, a robust, responsive set of widgets that adhere to the specific COSMIC design language. This includes buttons, sliders, text inputs, and other elements that are styled to match the rest of the desktop.</p>
<p>During development, the team even had to build basic features like text rendering, drag-and-drop, clipboard support, a full-featured compositor and support for input methods. But with such a modern codebase, System76 was able to avoid the significant technical debt that comes with generations of legacy code that complicates other desktop environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061597191758880429gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6061597191758880429gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18290536971758880429gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18290536971758880429gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The COSMIC Beta is available with the Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta and for testing in Fedora, NixOS, Arch, CachyOS and others.</p>
<p>As for the Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta, System76 supplied some release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta includes the new COSMIC Desktop Environment designed and developed by System76. COSMIC DE is largely feature complete for the first release and development focus has turned to bug fixes for the final release. ● This is a beta release and some bugs are expected. </li>

      <title>ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally up for pre-order to take on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft and Asus have now put the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally up for pre-order, ready to take on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>We continue to see handhelds move in the wrong direction on pricing though. The ROG Xbox Ally X is USD $999.99, but the ROG Xbox Ally is a more reasonable USD $599.99. The problem is, Valve's Steam Deck just <em>cannot</em> be beaten on the price to performance ratio, especially with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/grab-the-steam-deck-lcd-256gb-for-cheap-as-valve-gave-it-a-discount/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">currently having a 20% discount</a> making it truly worth grabbing.</p>
<p>Even having the higher specifications on the Xbox Ally X, with the Z2 Extreme chip, the performance difference really isn't going to be worth that price tag. Especially so for the plain Xbox Ally, with a similar chip to the Steam Deck (and powering a higher resolution screen too). However, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the anti-cheat problem on SteamOS / Linux</a> is not an issue for Windows - so that might perhaps entice a few more buyers.</p>
<p>Microsoft do have another issue here though — confusion. No doubt with the Xbox naming, there will be plenty who go in expecting traditional Xbox games to work, but they won't since like the Steam Deck it is just a PC. You may not think this is an issue, but I can guarantee it will end up as one. The masses are not particularly well informed when it comes to buying hardware - anyone who has worked retail or technical support will know it well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-pPqcWGnVDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd566cf492da1e428560c795710dba92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-pPqcWGnVDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Could be some nice devices to install <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite Linux</a> on though. How long do we think it will be before Bazzite gets support for running on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally? It will be interesting to see if Microsoft / Asus have made it difficult to install another OS on it.</p>
<p>Both devices launch October 16th. See the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-ally-starting-today/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for more info.</p>
<p>We really are entering a new world when it comes to gaming though. Valve truly laid the groundwork here for handheld PC gaming, and now everyone wants a slice of the pie. I do think these are the first actual proper competition for the Steam Deck, since there's an entry model and backing from Microsoft. Plus, Microsoft's work to bring all stores under one roof with their newer UI for handhelds that will debut with the ROG Xbox Ally - we're in for some turbulence here.</p>

      <title>Steam Link VR now available for PICO and HTC headsets, plus Valve confirm experimental Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated Steam Link VR to bring support for streaming games to PICO and HTC headsets, plus new info on the experimental Linux support.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/514096230384533860?utm_source=SteamDB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve mentioned it will now work across PICO 4 Ultra, PICO 4, PICO Neo 3, HTC Vive Focus Vision and HTC VIVE XR Elite (later this year). All those in addition to the already supported Meta Quest headsets.</p>
<p>The app has been added to the stores for both vendors, and Valve confirmed they're working on a fresh SteamVR Beta with a Steam Link APK for other hardware manufacturers to validate Steam Link on their headsets themselves, and to allow users of unsupported headsets to try it out too.</p>
<p>All part of Valve's ongoing work to make PC VR as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Earlier in September we had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-link-vr-for-meta-quest-on-linux-now-appears-to-work-in-the-latest-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux article</a> about how Steam Link VR appeared to work on Linux in the latest updates, with Valve not mentioning it anywhere. That's now changed, and has become just a <em>little</em> bit more official. On the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0E2C-406B-9135-38A4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">help page</a> for Steam Link VR, the FAQ has been expanded to note the Linux status as experimental.</p>
<p>For Linux support Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Link VR Uses Vulkan Video, and driver support for Vulkan Video is only available in the newest drivers. Please use NVIDIA drivers 575.64.05 or newer or if AMD, please use Mesa drivers [25.2.2] or newer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully Valve will sometime soon make PC VR even more interesting with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/new-valve-trademark-for-steam-frame-looks-like-were-getting-new-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame</a>.</p>

	<ul>
<li>The screen reader language may also be manually configured under Settings-&gt;Accessibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Audio</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed volume jumping to 100% upon removing 3.5mm headphones</li>

</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, Microsoft / Xbox Games Studios have actually been one of the better few at ensuring their games are not blocked in Proton (mostly) unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many other developers</a> when it comes to anti-cheat. They at least don't go out of their way to block Linux for their modern PC releases. However, it's worth noting that while Forza Horizon 5 works Forza Motorsport does <em>not</em>. Hopefully this one will. We'll be keeping an eye on it to let you know at release next year.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown gets a first gameplay trailer and you can keep Tuvix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is one game that I am extremely excited for, and the first gameplay trailer is now here.</p>
<p>This officially licensed game will blend exploration, crew and ship management, consequential choices, and what-if scenarios that can reshape who makes it home — and what Voyager becomes along the way. I'll finally be able to get Kes to stay, and keep Tuvix along for the ride too. I'm still undecided if Harry Kim deserves a promotion.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rKmMRBIMq2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53b3746171d8d74bf6b3b62b1f271d29.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rKmMRBIMq2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No release date or even a release window for it yet, we'll just have to wait and see. Clearly not finished yet, with the trailer noting it's a work in progress. The trailer showcases teasers for plenty of the game mechanics from repairing and upgrading the ship, to a number of important story events.</p>
<p>This and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> really are a dream come true for me, very excited by both of these worlds to be more explored.</p>
<p>What events are you hoping to see in the game to change? Perhaps never taking on 7 of 9? Let me know your wild ideas in the comments.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Wolverine gets a proper trailer and it&#39;s brutal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we don't know when it will come to PC, we at least finally have a chance to see some action in the trailer for Marvel's Wolverine.</p>
<p>It will come to PC eventually though — right? PlayStation 5 gets it in "Fall 2026", so what do we think, late in 2027? We did eventually get Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales so we have a good bet to see it on PC.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the blood-soaked trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s3pDMUWlA6I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/98eac7223d41a77ad6325089b808fcfe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a behind the scenes look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oBib2xkYfE4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a560fe50444a05ceaa66da32ae4c883.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oBib2xkYfE4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As soon as we hear of a PC release we'll let you know. By the time it does come to PC, no doubt Proton will run it on Linux systems thanks to all the work Valve has put in over the years.</p>
<p>Now, if we could just get Sony to hurry up with Death Stranding 2 on PC we'll be golden.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic is returning, with Deus Ex Remastered getting announced for release on February 5th 2026 that aims to be the "definitive edition".</p>

<p>Check out the brief announcement teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z-Sg7ps5WkQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57ed46a6e83f95489bfd06ac638afa9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z-Sg7ps5WkQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The reception so far doesn't exactly seem too positive, the YouTube comments are filled with complaints about how it looks. Same with the Steam forum, although that's not surprising, the Steam forums are often a mess on a lot of games. You're probably going to be unimpressed with me at this point, but I actually haven't played the original. I know, I know - there's still so many classics I haven't found the time for. Big fan of the modern games though, shame we won't see a proper conclusion.</p>
<p>Worth noting that the original Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is currently less than £1 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> until September 29th. And, if you pair it up with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deus Ex: Revision mod</a>, you're already getting a pretty good looking and much loved community remaster.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-17 released fixing Warframe as probably other games too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 10-17 was just released following on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/ge-proton-10-16-released-with-a-tweak-for-star-citizen-and-a-stellar-blade-modding-fix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-16 a few days ago</a>, to further enhanced Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. As is often the case with normal GE-Proton updates, a few issues end up being found that need a smaller fix later.</p>
<p>The single-line noted fix for GE-Proton 10-17 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Just a hotfix/refresh release, updates dxvk and other main components, fixes warframe crash and probably a few others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Pictured - Warframe</p>
<p>With all the different Proton versions it can get confusing so see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>

      <title>CHARK is a smooth Balatro-inspired chess roguelike and I&#39;ve become an instant fan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Balatro started another clear trend in gaming, with multiple games spawning like it and CHARK seems like it could end up being a real gem.</p>
<p>CHARK is a chess roguelike with a <em>very</em> similar setup to Balatro. Taking the basics of chess but turning it into something quite different overall, as it's based on rounds where you're trying to beat a very specific score of taking down enemy pieces on the board. You earn money as you go to buy extras in a shop to help you really screw with it and build up a ridiculous score. </p>
<p>The setup gives you a small cut-down version of a chess board containing your Queen and a few enemy pieces. You move your Queen across the board using cards, with each card being a different chess piece — so you get to use their moves to take out enemy pieces and build up that score to reach the goal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12909506831758717167gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While it still needs some work to make certain bits clearer, and no doubt a fair amount more content, what's there already in the idea of it is really good.</p>
<p>Another game does exist that merges together chess with Balatro in Passant: A Chess Roguelike, although that is still a fair bit different to the setup here in CHARK so that they're both quite unique. CHARK is simple, effective and has turned into a really nice way to kill some time and I think you'll like it too.</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AsxErWnjavc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f57bec9d1c312ec9c407d49163a0053e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AsxErWnjavc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game is still in the earlier stages, with the developer currently looking for a publishing partner. You can try it out right now though, and no need to install anything as you can play it right in the browser.</p>
<p>Try it free in the browser on <a href="https://protzz.itch.io/chark" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>

      <title>OVIS LOOP is a dark action roguelike about robotic sheep versus wolves and it&#39;s a real surprise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in some sort of post-apocalypse with various robotic animals, OVIS LOOP is a tale of sheep versus wolves and it's a genuine delight. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's all a bit mysterious, at least at the start as you're piecing together info about the world. Why is everything in a complete state? What's with all the robots? Why are the wolves so damn mad at you - what did you do? I need answers. Some really nice design went into this for the story, as well as the characters with the excellent pixel-art. It's the action of it that really helps to sell this one though, with a Dead Cells-like feel to it on the basics.</p>
<p>You get a sort-of deck-building element to it with how you power-up your sheep, Omega, during a run. You start off with a basic weapon and ability, but you unlock other special abilities. After that, you continually beat various enemies to end up taking your pick from their abilities to add to your own as if you're some sort of Borg. So you can end up with some really wild combinations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4104630651758714471gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4104630651758714471gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's all about the loop, repeating runs to learn more about the world and try all the <em>many</em> different combo attacks you can end up doing. Especially once you finish your first run you then see how the game expands, with a starter hub area where you can spend resources you've earned during a run to continue to power up Omega with meta upgrades. The run progression is a bit like Slay the Spire, with a map where you pick nodes to travel between with each being a different encounter.</p>
<p>The actual levels where you fight are a bit small though, especially compared with the sprawling areas in Dead Cells and others similar. Lots of enemies at the same time too, it gets to the point that it becomes a lot more of a button-masher as you're just trying to mass-damage enemies as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>So it is perhaps a bit more like Skul: The Hero Slayer than Dead Cells. Not a bad thing, the combat is a <em>lot</em> of fun once you've gone through and built up the special combo attacks because it's a real flashy spectacle. Landing hit after hit, leading into your special attacks one after the other with combos you've built through the run. That's the good stuff right there.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Made by Korean indie team LIFUEL, it's impressive work for two people. A spokesperson for the LIFUEL team said: "We know this isn’t a battle a single sheep can win, but we hope you will. Our love for pixel-action is shown in every element, from the detailed backdrops to the satisfying combat. Ovis Loop is the culmination of four years of hard work".</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Step into the dark sci-fi world as Omega, a robotic sheep on a mission to repel the wolf threat.</li>
<li>Face diverse packs of wolves, each with distinct attacks, skills, and behaviours.</li>
<li>Embrace your inner hacker by downloading skills from fallen enemies and adapting them to suit your needs as you see fit.</li>
<li>Experience richly detailed pixel art that brings the sci-fi world of Ovis Loop to life, inspired by classic sci-fi aesthetics.</li>
<li>Enjoy full keyboard and controller support, including customizable keybindings to suit your preferred playstyle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love games like Dead Cells, Skul: The Hero Slayer and other action-roguelikes this should be an absolute no-brainer to pick up. Very impressed with all parts of this one. I've been thoroughly enjoying my time with it and I'm seriously looking forward to the added content planned for it.</p>
<p>It's currently 20% off on Steam until September 29th. It works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The devs of Silicon Dreams announced Duskpunk a gritty tabletop-inspired RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clockwork Bird just announced Duskpunk, a gritty tabletop-inspired RPG and narrative adventure due to release later this year. They've previously made Silicon Dreams | cyberpunk interrogation, which has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Their inspiration comes from various tabletop RPGs, with the flavour of narrative adventure games like Citizen Sleeper. They said that Duskpunk is a game of hope, grit and survival. You're an ex-soldier, mistaken for dead and shipped back to the city of Dredgeport to be processed into fuel. After a narrow escape, you find yourself alone with only two things to your name: your life and your sanity. Keeping both will prove a challenge. In the game you have to manage various stats like your health, energy and stress levels as you try to make a new start in a world consumed by war.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Like a creepy version of hide and seek, It Has My Face is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creepy stuff. It Has My Face makes you seek out your clone amongst the crowd, like some sort of hide and seek but with a real sinister vibe. The problem is, your clone wants to kill you. So you have to kill them first.</p>
<p>To help you deal with the situation you have to scavenge for weapons, although you only get limited ammo. Did you fail? Well tough luck, you're easier to spot now. And something about biological horrors, with you finding more about what's going on and new threats as the game progresses.</p>
<p>It's a really clever stealthy-action horror spin on hide and seek and looks to be a really fun time, and with the Early Access release they've even added in 1v1 online multiplayer! The release also has more story chapters and an endless invasion mode too compared to the demo.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AqswuibJ2N4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2340a9868773ad09e586ff939f680d99.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AqswuibJ2N4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It was originally called DoubleWe, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/kill-your-clone-before-they-find-you-in-doublewe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered here on GamingOnLinux</a> with the very early demo back in 2024. The new name is much better, and with a publisher it seems they were able to make it even better from the original idea.</p>
<p>Early Access won't last too long for this one, as the developer said they think it will take three to six months to finish it up. During this time they plan to finish the story, add more enemy types, new multiplayer modes and so on.</p>
<p>It Has My Face is available with Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. It's Verified with the Native version (not Proton).</p>

      <title>A shotgun for an arm, boomer shooter Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation arrives in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A retro styled boomer shooter where you have a shotgun for an arm. Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation is confirmed to launch on November 25th. The developer also mentions how it's half game, half cartoon as there's a whole lot of animated cutscenes to go along with the action.</p>
<p>More about it: "Stranded on Orca Isle after a brutal ambush, Wayne’s vacation plans have gone straight to Davy Jones’ locker. Now it’s all-out war against the ruthless mercenary gang known as the Killer Whales. From chain-gun fingers to explosive Boom Brew, fruity-but-deadly coconuts to bone-crunching fists, Wayne’s arsenal ensures the only thing deeper than the ocean will be the enemy body count."</p>
<p>With the release date announced, a brand new refreshed demo has also been released.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KdZUmVNi39k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/03587a71ba1194853a88b82f95ebe019.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KdZUmVNi39k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brutal, stylized cartoon gore-fest, because who said bloodshed can’t be beautiful?</li>
<li>8 massive, enemy-packed zones across treacherous Orca Isle.</li>
<li>An arsenal of absurdly over-the-top weapons, fine-tuned for maximum mayhem.</li>
<li>A relentlessly chaotic soundtrack, louder than a storm at sea.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn, fully-voiced cinematics that bring Wayne’s twisted quest to life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the demo only has a Windows build (runs with Proton), it seems the actual main store page does list Linux support and it's made with GZDoom. So either way, you'll be able to play this one on Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Monster taming roguelite Aethermancer from the devs of Monster Sanctuary now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More monster taming goodness for you today, as Aethermancer from Monster Sanctuary developer moi rai games is now in Early Access with Linux support.</p>
<p>The monsters defied the virtues of this world and are trapped in a cycle of death and rebirth. Players become the Aethermancer and fight their way through the procedurally generated Fractured Ruins alongside these mythical creatures. The game combines creature collecting, turn-based combat and the roguelite formula to let you build your own powerful team of monsters. Use your powers (and your mythical friends) to win strategic 3v3 turn-based battles, defy death, and escape the fractured ruins.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the design on their previous game Monster Sanctuary, especially the sound design and this looks like they've really upped the production values on it to make something even better. So far it's rated Very Positive on Steam. Valve also gave it a Steam Deck Verified rating with the default being the Native Linux version of the game (not Proton).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recruit and tame mythical monsters to fight at your side.</li>
<li>Upgrade unique elemental skills for each monster.</li>
<li>Plan ahead to win strategic turn-based 3v3 battles.</li>
<li>Explore a gorgeous procedurally generated world.</li>
<li>Unlock new player classes and bend the rules.</li>
<li>Monsters – and you – grow stronger with each new life.</li>

      <title>Your only weapon is a deadly bouncing ball in Sydless - check out the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A first-person baller? Sydless has a fun idea with you repeatedly punching a deadly bouncing ball around rooms to take down enemies. For the Boomstock festival on Steam, the game has a demo now available and it works great with Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>More about it: "As Diego, a late ’90s fast-food worker trapped in a twisted anomaly at Randy’s Burger, you’ll face warped customers, shifting environments, and a reality spiralling out of control."</p>
<p>Sydless turns every room into a blender, arming players with a high-speed bouncing ball that grows faster and deadlier the more you punch it. The speed of it gets quite intense, with you being able to momentarily stop the ball to punch it again and give it a little aim. Quite a silly idea but it somehow works.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IamCDXe3uOw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/302ae52ede4b4e07f16655aea0dc45a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IamCDXe3uOw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo that's now live gives you a slice of the first chapter. This has several levels and unlockable powers, and a local ranking system.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bouncing Ball Combat:</strong> Master the art of controlling a deadly bouncing ball! The more you punch it, the faster and deadlier it becomes. Turn every room into a chaotic battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Fast-Paced Movement:</strong> Wall-jump, Slide, Dash, Ground Slam and punch your way through shifting environments. Precision and speed are key to survival.</li>
<li><strong>Reality-Bending World In the ‘90s:</strong> Navigate through Randy's Burger, a failed fast-food restaurant in the late ‘90s trapped in an endless anomaly, each room more twisted than the last.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Skill System:</strong> Unlock new powers across four chapters, adding depth to your combat and movement.</li>
<li><strong>Ranking System:</strong> Each level tracks your speed, skill, and efficiency. Climb the leaderboard and master every stage!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve revamps the Steam store menu with enhanced searching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since July and previously only in the Steam Client, Valve have released the refresh of the Steam store menu with enhanced search. Now on the web store too, not just the client - everyone has it.</p>
<p>It's more compact, with rearranged options and it will appear again when you scroll up a little. Giving you easy access to a few recommendations, your discovery queue to find new games, Steam hardware and more. The enhanced search is the real highlight here though. When you go to search for something now it will show a box with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular Searches</strong>: See what others are searching for right now</li>
<li><strong>Recently Viewed</strong>: An easy way to jump back to games you've previously looked at</li>
<li><strong>More than just games</strong>: Search for categories/tags, publishers, and more</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Search link</strong>: For those who want to refine their game search even further, we’ve made it easier than ever to access the advanced search page with a variety of filters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9019837841758702943gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam store</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on it?</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gets a Native Linux version to improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian have just released a fresh update for Baldur's Gate 3, which brings a Native Linux version made for the Steam Deck. I mentioned they were doing this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/valve-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-issue-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a recent GamingOnLinux article</a> talking about an issue it had and now it's here.</p>
<p>Originally, it used Proton to run the Windows version (like a lot of games) but Larian say with the new Native version it should result in a "more stable framerate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>Additionally, the work they put into this update benefits <em>everyone</em> as they said you should see "overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3".</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, you won't lose any saves with the move, as long as your Steam Cloud is up to date. Larian also put up a <a href="https://larian.com/support/faqs/steam-deck-native-version_121" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated guide</a> for the transition to the new version. In short: if you wish to change it over before Valve re-run it through verification to swap it, go into the game Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the "Force..." box and select "Steam Linux Runtime". <em>Although, that should already be done by Valve.</em></p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux support, Larian gave a definitive no on that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Now that there is a Steam Deck Native build, is Baldur’s Gate 3 supported on Linux?</strong></p>
<p>Larian does not provide support for the Linux platform. The Steam Deck Native build is only supported on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll refrain from moaning about the Steam Deck being treated like it's <em>not</em> Linux. But I get what they're saying, this is specifically for the Steam Deck as a device with SteamOS Linux. For all other Linux systems from PCs to different handhelds, you'll want to stick with Proton.</p>
<p>The issue for Desktop Linux is a bit confusing. Larian has set this for Linux + Steam Deck, so right now the Native Linux version will <em>only</em> download on Steam Deck and leave Desktop Linux with a broken empty download (or broken update if you had it installed already). You will need to manually force Proton until this is solved. I sent a <a href="http://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/12344" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> to Valve on it. <strong>Update: 20:21 UTC</strong> - looks like this has been fixed and it now downloads on Desktop Linux. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9647349971758642710gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p>Speaking on X, Larian's Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1970526548592623969" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story of how this came to be really is one of true passion. The Steam Deck native build was initiated by a single engineer who really wanted a smoother version of the game on Steam Deck and so he started working on it after hours. When we tried it out, we were all surprised by how good it felt and so it didn't take much to convince us to put our shoulders behind it and get it released. It's this type of pure passion for their craft that makes me fall in love with my developers over and over again. Considering myself very lucky to have people like him on my team. Try it out!"</p>

      <title>3rd person action roguelite mech-builder Granvir is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Granvir brings solo and online co-op to mech-building, with Linux support it's officially available today and it's great. They also previously released Granvir: Zero Front, a standalone cut-down version for you to try for free to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>More about it: pilot your Granvir and manage your campaign between battles to find the best equipment and stay supplied while fighting back against the Millennium Company invasion of Inheritance in single-player or with friends in multiplayer co-op. You can end up building some pretty fun mechs in it, a bit of a dream for fans of things like Gundam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HNXPPHE4SL4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/beac91b4b68d8823103d3c5f6e242c17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HNXPPHE4SL4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equip An Arsenal Of Deadly Weapons: </strong>Don devastating melee weapons such as swords, rocket spears, and jaw arms. In addition you can wield powerful long range guns like cannons, machine guns, flamethrowers and rockets. Mix and match them to suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Your Granvir Your Way:</strong> Mix arms, legs, armatures, and special modules to customize your mech. Defeating ace pilots grants their unique parts for your use.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy With Friends: </strong>Complete any campaign in single-player or multiplayer co-op with up to 10 Granvir pilots at a time. Share parts and resources utilizing the squad depot in rest areas as you plan your next moves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct The Campaign:</strong> No campaign is the same as you manage time, resources, and your route to each objective. Each zone dictates what services and resources are available to you. Use down time between missions to refit and upgrade your Granvir to prevail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A whole bunch of content is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2743460/view/542243094205040437" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">planned</a> post-release including a new story campaign, new mission environments, more parts for your mechs, new enemies and much more.</p>
<p>I played quite a lot of Granvir: Zero Front and really enjoyed the mech building in it. Really pleases my brain to see more mech games appearing lately that are actually <em>good</em>. Still nice to see games releasing with direct Native Linux support too, hopefully it continues working well.</p>

      <title>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally gets night vision and more upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Going back to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is probably going to feel like quite a different game, and that actually excites me again.</p>
<p>They just released another major free upgrade for the game finally adding in night vision goggles, along with some other gameplay enhancements. This was one of my major requests to add, so I'm pleased to see it made it in. There's also offset aiming, a laser pointer, updates to the combat systems, NPCs can loot mutants noew, a new Fireball anomaly, controller improvements, a save backup and restore option, new face and hair options for female characters, improved modding support and lots of fixes to the game overall.</p>

<p>Curiosity will be rewarded with a number of secrets to uncover. Including alternative routes off the main path and shortcuts to shave precious seconds off of your speed-run time, there’s plenty to see for those who decide to dive deeper into the game’s dungeons.</p>

      <title>A first look at the spooky game OD from KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we don't yet know when it will release or come to Steam, OD from KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS and Xbox Game Studios looks freaky as heck. Given Microsoft's push to put more games on PC, I've no doubt it will eventually pop up on Steam after release. </p>
<p>It's nice to see more from it, although we still don't entirely know what exactly it will be, other than some form of horror. KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS are getting help from Microsoft on this one, with Xbox's Phil Spencer on stage during their livestream saying: "OD is bold, it's unique and it's unmistakably from this studio. Which is just incredible. We're deeply supporting the production, it's our technical work on Unreal that we're doing with the team, both with the flashy <em>[features]</em> you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind the scenes work. We have one goal in mind, which is to bring Kojima's vision to life for all players everywhere."</p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eHCqxLtwy5g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1919774f8debe81b12a90ae807019a4c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An interesting choice to go with Unreal Engine for it, switching away from the Sony-owned Decima game engine, with Kojima noting how Unreal Engine tech is "one step higher than Death Stranding 2".</p>
<p><em>Now if we could just get Sony to put Death Stranding 2 finally on PC I'll be happy.</em></p>

      <title>Comedy first-person adventure The Dungeon Experience from Devolver Digital gets a demo and new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Dungeon Experience is a comedy first-person adventure about a low-level mudcrab helping to bring you the true bliss of Financial Freedom. <em>Whatever the heck that actually means.</em></p>
<p>One of the developers, Jacob Janerka, previously made the quirky and funny adventure game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600370/Paradigm/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paradigm</a> which I'm a big fan of. Knowing their humour, this is going to be a good one. With Devolver Digital publishing, I have high hopes for the quality of it too.</p>
<p>From the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lowly crab started life as a humble crustacean scraping by at the bottom of the food chain, a low level RPG monster, but now – thanks to determination, optimism, and a modest investment in crab scented essential oil candles – he’s the proud owner of a fully featured, highly desirable dungeon, now confirmed to have asbestos all removed. </p>
<p>And he wants to share this life-changing opportunity with YOU!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="im4DtyULXSo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/04a58041340a0f2c474233c6ef672819.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/im4DtyULXSo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Yep, that was definitely marketing for something. Funny though.</p>

      <title>Pocketpair announced farming life sim spin-off Palworld: Palfarm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have to be trolling Nintendo and The Pokémon Company at this point, with the announcement of Palworld: Palfarm.</p>
<p>Not just because of the ongoing lawsuit over Palworld versus Pokémon but little over a week ago, Nintendo only just revealed Pokémon Pokopia, their own blend of Pokémon with a life sim and now we have Pocketpair doing something very similar.</p>
<p>Just watch, Nintendo will now probably attempt to patent some kind of mechanics included in Pokémon Pokopia like they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/nintendo-get-another-problematic-patent-in-their-fight-against-palworld-for-summoning-characters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doing with another problematic patent</a>. They won't, probably not anyway, especially given the masses of prior art on it but never say never when it comes to Nintendo.</p>
<p>No release date has been revealed yet for Palfarm but it's not lost on me that Pocketpair are announcing a new game, with two others still in Early Access. One of which, Craftopia, has been in Early Access for over five years at this point. Hopefully they will actually finish it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Palfarm trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AmurGwwjvGM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6658cacbd2e77e64254f510549eac20.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AmurGwwjvGM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Must admit, I do actually like the look of this one. And with online co-op as well, it might turn into a great one to play with friends. Love how they blended a very cosy vibe and then suddenly – creepy person playing russian roulette? And then back to being cosy on the beach and rolling snowballs and all sorts. And then right at the end, the suddenly sinister vibe returns of catching a Pal that wants just to be friends. Okay then.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move to an island where the Pals live, work together to till the fields, cook, craft, and build the farm of your dreams.</p>
<p>Each Pal will lend a hand in farm work by making use of their unique abilities. From sowing seeds and watering to harvesting, Pals make for reliable partners. Deepen your relationships with the island residents and Pals through daily conversation and gift-giving, and you may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding.</p>
<p>At times, you’ll also need to defend your farm from some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc. Head to the market, buy and sell crops or crafted goods, and sometimes even obtain rare items. Of course, multiplayer is also supported, so you can build your farm life together with friends.</p>
<p>A cosy life is waiting for you with your Pals!</p>

      <title>Deadly Days: Roadtrip brings inventory management to survivor-likes and it&#39;s damn good</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending inventory management with a zombies horde-based road trip bullet heaven, Deadly Days Roadtrip is a delight. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Once again taking the mechanics popularised by Vampire Survivors, but with a fresh spin on it that’s a bit more like Death Road to Canada mixed with backpack management found in the likes of Backpack Hero. All together, that’s a lot of “it’s like this but also this” so I’ll attempt to break it down a little more for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2500414321758627615gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2500414321758627615gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadly Days: Roadtrip on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu)</em></p>
<p>You start off in a basic camp with nothing but your bus. So off you pop, and pick a location to run around and loot in. Each location to pick has a different map size, general loot amount and amount of fuel you can find. In the locations you run around while your character auto-fires (you can manually aim like a twin-stick too), and you pick up experience gems from dead zombies. When you level up you auto-throw a flare and after a short delay along comes a little care package. This is where the real hook is!</p>
<p>Inside the package you get to pick an item. This could be a power-up item, a new weapon, a gadget of some sort or more slots to build your backpack to get more space to add even more into it next time.</p>
<p>The inventory management alone is quite a challenge. You can initially only wield two main weapons (like guns or bats and knives), as after all - you’re only human. Each weapon takes up 1 or 2 slots, for single or double-handed. It’s how you arrange that inventory that matters due to the many different additional items that can stack upgrades onto weapons. Like a lighter that can add burning to ammo to set zombies ablaze. All these extra items have specific backpack slots they affect, so that’s where you have to rearrange everything to fit and synergise together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4850594731758625523gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4850594731758625523gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadly Days: Roadtrip on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Eventually, you might be able to stack some more weapons if you’re lucky enough to find the legendary Robot Arm. However, this is <em>inventory Tetris</em>, and so the arm takes up valuable backpack space too. Decisions - decisions, making room for it is the obvious choice of course. Who doesn't love more weapons?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6704963241758625913gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6704963241758625913gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadly Days: Roadtrip on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Another fun bit is that you can drop the same weapon on top of another, and it will level them up to make them more powerful too. The game doesn’t actually tell you that though, and it took me a while to even realise as it just does a small arrow animation over the same weapons that I entirely missed for a while. Easy to miss when you’re not looking for it. Nice to have but one small bit they should explain better.</p>
<p>There is a point to exploring these locations too as you need to find more fuel to feed your bus to continue on your journey to the next destination. The longer you stay to get as much loot as you can, the more challenging it gets and it can end up pretty brutal. As soon as you have enough fuel to leave, you can make a run for your bus - but that can at times be insanely tough. Especially if you overstayed your welcome.</p>
<p>There’s a nice mixture of enemy types from the mindless walkers, to some that will dash as you, throw up some toxic stuff your way and more. I've lost count of the amount of times I've died in it, often due to my own stupidity but the later exploration is a true challenge.</p>
<p>You also get stopped along the way with special levels that interrupt your trip. Here you get a smaller map with specific objectives like clearing actual roadblocks or taking down specific enemies, like the shot below where you have to take down Titans, much bigger and tougher enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170730471758625525gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170730471758625525gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadly Days: Roadtrip on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>At first you think it’s a bit light on content, then you finish your first run and realise that’s just the start. Back to camp you go, and new things have appeared. Like a crafting table, that allows you to unlock more for your future runs like new items, a merchant, an item workbench to craft new items and much more.</p>
<p>It’s in your camp where you can now also do character upgrades. Depending on how long you survive you get apples, a currency to boost your stats like max HP and attack speed.</p>
<p>As fun as it is, I think they’re playing it perhaps a bit <em>too safe</em>. Or maybe <em>plain</em> is the better word here? I would love to see them play with the absurdity of a zombie apocalypse a bit more. You can see a small glimpse of it at times, like when you get a powerup from a box that explodes zombies on death for 30 seconds. Or the little bits of map destruction already in that they could really amplify. You can destroy a few select items on the map - I want lots more like that for it.</p>
<p>The game has only just begun life, and I expect it’s going to be another big indie hit during its time in Early Access. Incredibly keen to see where they take it. Already more polished and fun than a lot of finished games.</p>
<p>Good performance on Steam Deck too and it works great out of the box. Valve, weirdly, gave it only a Playable rating noting various issues that just don't seem to exist. This <em>should</em> be a <strong>Verified</strong> game as far as I can see. I've put almost all of my hours into it on Steam Deck. No issues to report on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) either, it works very nicely.</p>
<p>It tickles the happy part of my brain. A properly fun blend of things. I love turning a big horde into zombie confetti when I’ve really juiced my weapons with fancy items after spending 15 minutes sorting my bag.</p>
<p>That is until I die for the 5th time in a row, but then that itch comes back and I need another run to scratch it. And another run I will have, often, to the point that my total hours in it shocked even me. Where does time go?</p>
<p>Great stuff, you should go grab it.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes DualSense crash on Linux / SteamOS and improves game recording with Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small Beta update for Desktop PCs, SteamOS and Steam Deck for the Steam Client to fix up some more annoying problems.</p>
<p>For Desktop here's the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545620793932908810?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved High Contrast view of game list search and app filter panel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved performance when recording is on for some games using Vulkan rendering</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when DualSense controllers are connected and idle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam Deck / SteamOS update also just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/498332997840275674" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> the DualSense fix, since it's a Linux issue. Nice to see that solved.</p>
<p>It's currently in Beta / Preview so you need to opt into receiving it before it rolls out into the Stable channel for all Steam users. Another recent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/502836144430384152?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Beta update</a> also put Windows 10 32bit on notice, as Valve will be removing 32bit support for Windows soon. Hopefully at some point we may also eventually see a 64 bit client for Linux too.</p>

      <title>Grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB for cheap as Valve gave it a discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just put the Steam Deck LCD 256GB on sale, so you can get ready for the upcoming Steam Autumn Sale ahead of time with some new hardware.</p>
<p>While the Steam Autumn Sale doesn't start until September 29th, right now you can go ahead and grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model with 20% off. This discount on the Steam Deck will run from now all the way through the Steam Autumn Sale until October 6th. So there's no hurry, but stocks also do tend to fly whenever Valve put the Steam Deck on a discount.</p>
<p>That makes it only £279.20 / $319.20, which is an absolutely <em>ridiculous</em> bargain for what you actually get. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-deck-and-steamos-hit-20000-playable-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 20,000 games playable on it</a>, you're sure to find plenty to love about it.

      <title>Megabonk is Risk of Rain 2 fused with Vampire Survivors and it&#39;s glorious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An unholy fusion of Risk of Rain 2 with Vampire Survivors is what you'll find with Megabonk and it absolutely freaking rocks. Seriously, this is some glorious and delicious stuff that you don't want to miss out on. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>You pick a character and then jump into a randomly generated map. Run around with auto-firing weapons, pick up experience gems and pick a random level up boost to keep powering up your character. You know the drill by now. However, with it being in 3D, it adds some fun flavour to it. Not just because you can run, jump and slide about - but the characters are just plain silly too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9h5eUbIXg-M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8869d3e5c19874736caf348785646dc9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9h5eUbIXg-M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Risk of Rain 2 spice, there's various chests spread around you can buy to open to pull out special relics as well. The general setup of it just really feels like RoR2 blended with Vampire Survivors and anyone who has played both will be quite familiar. Run around as long as you can, fight bosses and just keep on going.</p>
<p>It really leans into the comedy too, not just on the silly descriptions and items, but the fact that I can slide all the way down a hill on a sword while all my abilities fire off — it's so satisfying and dumb you can't help but love it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21293113681758548951gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21293113681758548951gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of developers have tried to replicate the success of Vampire Survivors, and only a few have managed to actually carve out their own place in a now very crowded genre. Megabonk thankfully feels fresh enough that I'm willing to spend hours of my personal time playing it. Being in full 3D really gives them more leverage, like how one unlock you can get is to add more jumps and so eventually you'll be leaping across the map over enemies and obstacles high up in the sky. It's so fun to find all the weird combinations you can add together.</p>
<p>The maps are littered with some funny characters to find and interact with, and in some cases rescue. There's a shady guy to buy upgrades from, a microwave that will magically clone a relic you've acquired and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6011147861758550806gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6011147861758550806gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it has 240 in-game quests, 20 characters with unique abilities, over 70 items all with their own different synergies and more to discover.</p>
<p>Out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. Megabonk is just pure stupid joy to play. The Linux version has been running very nicely too.</p>
<p>It's going to take over my life. I fully expect it to be a huge success, and I hope so because I want to see this have a long life with lots of additions. What's there is fantastic but I want more, lots and lots more from it. Early indicators are it doing well, with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and it hit over 21,068 people playing recently.</p>

      <title>Need more metroidvania action? Stardust Demon is an overlooked gem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finished Hollow Knight: Silksong? Didn't find it punishing enough? You should really take a look at Stardust Demon. An overlooked gem with some pretty rad looking design, and a game that just keeps on expanding as you go through it. I was quite shocked to see it only had 67 user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it: Stardust Demon is a Cave Story-inspired metroidvania with an emphasis on its world's story and cute characters, and challenges that ramp up in difficulty including precision platforming elements. The aesthetic of the game uniquely combines colourful pixel-art with retro FMV cutscenes. Its eclectic soundtrack melds chip-tune, electronica, and metal influences together. </p>
<p>It originally released back in October 2024, and last month they added a major upgrade including a new Boss Rush game mode. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="23a9R62-YLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a03b16ca576ba41ea2e5ae5f517bb7a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/23a9R62-YLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support, and on Steam Deck it's rated Playable (need you to manually change resolution). If you can handle the difficulty, if you love a proper challenge - it's one not to be missed.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mixture of platforming, action, and puzzle gameplay.</li>
<li>Exploring multiple planets.</li>
<li>Weird and wonderful NPC's, rich and vibrant worlds.</li>
<li>Shops and optional quests.</li>
<li>Cutscenes with charming sprite animations.</li>
<li>Puzzles with varied mechanics including teleporting, reversing time for specific platforms, and more.</li>
<li>Many secrets and upgrades to be found.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Scribbly adventure Scrabdackle looks fantastic with a new trailer and demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scrabdackle is an action adventure I've been excited about for years, and now it has a proper fresh trailer along with a big demo upgrade.</p>
<p>What is it: Scrabdackle is a sprawling, scribbly adventure that blends exploration, challenge, with genuine joy. Players take on the role of novice wizard Blue, flung from the safety of the academy into a vast, hand-animated world full of secrets, tough-but-fair bosses, curious creatures, and a journey home that's anything but straightforward.</p>
<p>During the  Six One Indie Showcase it had a new trailer show up:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QzBF0ZH8qqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cce0c79581b8080e6d92f306b2896fcf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QzBF0ZH8qqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Act I will arrive sometime later this year with it in Early Access. Until then, you can try the demo which was refreshed with all these changes listed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1578720/view/499458897750261919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More readable fonts (larger sizes, better character differentiation),</li>
<li>A new "taskroll" quest menu replacing the one that, uh, no one knew was there or how to use (it was kind of hidden in the minimap),</li>
<li>Completion/collectible tracking per-region (via the taskroll),</li>
<li>Notifications for when quests are started and completed, and better tagging for when a quest will continue in the full game,</li>
<li>A huge performance/optimization pass that should be pretty clear to see the gains of for anyone who played the previous build,</li>
<li>Speaker tags indicating the name of who's speaking, and a conversation log in the pause menu,</li>
<li>Controller support (finally! - although, I do want to tune it more as feedback comes in),</li>
<li>A pretty substantial batch of misc QOL features,</li>
<li>Aaand a general fresh coat of polish on like, everything.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The story-driven Roguelike RPG &#39;Blanksword&#39; looks absolutely rad with a wild setting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes I come across a game that really just immediately jumps out at me as something that could be special, and Blanksword is one of those times. I'm getting some vibes from Undertale, DELTARUNE for this, just a little anyway.</p>
<p>What is it: Blanksword is a Roguelike RPG with strategic turn-based battles, a rich layered story, and a one of a kind brain management system. Enter a land full of dangers as BLANK, an amnesiac wandering Angel, and come to the aid of those that were wronged by God’s cruel law.</p>
<p>The setting of it is what really pulled me in, as it really does sound unique and interesting. Be sure to check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UmOtTNW1mAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c17cdf61c7b6e5182dd1169ff82ff7a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UmOtTNW1mAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/283910083/blanksword/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the developer hoping to raise €48,000 by October 17th. There's also a demo on Steam. Officially, they'll be supporting Windows so you can run it with Proton but they did say "ideally" they want to launch it for other platforms like Linux and macOS officially too.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with 15+ Brain Parts with game-changing properties.</li>
<li>Explore various regions such as a mushroom forest, a sprawling radio tower or moldy apartments.</li>
<li>Fight against a large panel of enemies, each with unique attacks and behaviors.</li>
<li>Customize your loadout each run with 150+ attacks &amp; skills that can fit into any playstyle.</li>
<li>Get to know a rich cast of well-fleshed out characters.</li>
<li>Beat challenges ranging from precise platforming to fight arenas and races against the clock.</li>
<li>Strengthen yourself between runs with permanent upgrades.</li>
<li>Line your pockets as you complete tasks… but not too much: in Blanksword, money is a curse!</li>
</ul>

<p>With all the different Proton versions it can get confusing so see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>

      <title>Baby Steps is Steam Deck Verified - I&#39;m ready to fall over everywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a delay due to Hollow Knight: Silksong, the hilarious looking physics walking sim Baby Steps is Steam Deck Verified for the new September 23rd launch.</p>
<p>This really does look like an absolute gem and I can't wait. I actually adored the challenge of the travel system in Death Stranding with you falling over plenty - and this looks like it turns things up quite a lot. The whole idea and setting of the game just looks completely absurd, to the point that one of the videos publisher Devolver Digital put up recently is how the game has a…breast milk slide — yes, that's a thing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SroBK1KwpEI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad2af61eb03ac92d15647e2c254f40e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SroBK1KwpEI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Every bit of footage of this game makes me confused, in the best possible way. It really does seem hilarious. The highlights of it make me laugh too, like how it has a "Fully dynamic onesie soilage system", just how dirty can one man on a walk get?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play as Nate, an unemployed failson with nothing going for him, until one day he discovers a power he never knew he had… putting one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Explore a world shrouded in mist, one step at a time. Hike the serene mountains by placing each footstep yourself, in original physics-based gameplay from the minds behind Ape Out and Getting Over It. Take in the sights, fall in love with the local fauna, and try to find meaning in a wasted life.</p>
<p>Get ready to fall for Nate, in Baby Steps, a literal walking simulator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Need to know more? Well, here's 10 minutes of falling in Baby Steps:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully-simulated physics based walking.</li>
<li>A world that seems to come alive with a dynamic soundtrack built up out of four hundred and twenty beats and vibes.</li>
<li>A lengthy trek up a mountain-sized mountain that you can explore at your own pace, or slower.</li>
<li>Fully dynamic onesie soilage system.</li>
<li>Non-collectible hats.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Exciting train combat deckbuilder roguelite Fogpiercer gets a new trailer and publisher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fogpiercer was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/build-a-train-to-expand-your-deck-and-fight-off-bandits-in-the-demo-for-fogpiercer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlight here on GamingOnLinux back in April</a>, and now it's coming back stronger with a brand new trailer and they've found a publisher.</p>
<p>What is it? A deckbuilder roguelite in which you build and upgrade your train to build your deck, fight off bandits on a square grid using unique carriage cards. Combat here is all about positioning, with you able to trick enemies into hitting each other or smashing them off the grid. It's releasing sometime in 2026 with Linux support and a demo is still available right now.</p>
<p>On Steam they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3219010/view/515221496441865362" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that Hooded Horse who published Manor Lords, Norland, Old World and more have become their partner on it. From the announcement the developer said: "This is a huge pickup for us, and we’re really looking forward to having Hooded Horse’s support as we make Fogpiercer the best game it can be. With their resources, we’ll be able to localize the game into more languages, reach a wider audience, have additional QA support, and spend more time actually developing the game!"</p>
<p>Check out the shiny new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OuEIQH6AsCU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83907b4cae05e53313f5a1f7f67dc41b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OuEIQH6AsCU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Fogpiercer has a great setting and innovative train-based gameplay, we think fans of roguelike deckbuilders are going to love this one,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “We're honored to be serving as their publisher."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made in the spirit of Westwood classics like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert, Dying Breed really does look awesome and it's releasing October 7th. Developed by Sarnayer with publishing from MicroProse Software, it looks incredibly promising.</p>
<p>I definitely miss the days of playing through games like this for hours and hours, and it really does look the part. Base building? Check! Resource gathering? Check! FMV cut-scenes? Heck yeah gimme that! Super weapons? Looks like it ticks that box and all. You can read a little background about how it all came together in their Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2088550/view/498332545088226355" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Please make it stop - Google Chrome to be reimagined with AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A break from the usual gaming news to moan about Google for a moment, thanks to their new blog post we have a glimpse of the future of Chrome and it's AI AI AI.</p>
<p>Google say they're about to take a step that will result in "fundamentally changing the nature of browsing" to move from a "passive experience to a more proactive and intelligent one". With that they've announced some major changes will be coming to Chrome.</p>
<p>The first is Gemini, their AI assistant, it's going to be your new "browsing assistant" that will "answer questions about articles, find references within YouTube videos, and will soon be able to help you find pages you’ve visited so you can pick up exactly where you left off" and it will integrate with other Google services.</p>
<p>On top of that they're planning to make "more advanced agentic capabilities for Gemini in Chrome that can perform multi-step tasks for you from start to finish". Difficult things like "booking a haircut" or "ordering your weekly groceries" will be a thing of the past Google hope, as they'll get their AI to do it for you.</p>
<p>Another change will be to the address bar, their "omnibox", as it's going to get "even smarter" with their new AI Mode.</p>
<p>Although, they only mention Windows and macOS for this in the post, no doubt it would come to Linux <em>eventually</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WjOvZ8n9MK0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78bf9c01dd8c77f3d711743cf56d50e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WjOvZ8n9MK0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More info across their <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-reimagined-with-ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> and another <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on some of the features.</p>
<p>So soon, you'll be told to add glue to pizza right in the address bar in Google Chrome! <em>Because we all know how factually accurate these AI tools are of course, they never ever make things up. </em>And with their AI Mode right in the browser, the idea of course like with AI Mode on Google Search, is to get you to never click away from anything Google.

<p>Firefox has also started adding in more AI features too, because apparently that's what everyone will be getting whether you like it or not. You simply must become part of the AI machine.</p>

      <title>Frostpunk 2 gets full controller support and should work better on Steam Deck / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios have published a major upgrade for Frostpunk 2, adding in full proper controller support with an adjusted UI to match. This should hopefully make it a lot better on Steam Deck and other SteamOS devices, and anyone doing some couch gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/11-bit-studios-working-on-getting-frostpunk-2-up-to-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in March</a>, 11 bit studios did confirm they wanted to work towards getting it Steam Deck Verified and this seems to be a solid step on that front. It not only gives you a controller styled UI, but they've also added in a new circular menu system that they reimagined from Frostpunk: Console Edition.</p>
<p>Example shots from the developer: </p>

<blockquote><strong>Interface</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implemented full controller support, featuring supporting UI .</li>
<li>Hospitals now display positive district notification when they heal people instead of the side notification.</li>

      <title>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition from Survios releases on September 30th and ahead of release Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>This was originally a VR-only game simple called Alien: Rogue Incursion, which is now titled Alien: Rogue Incursion VR. that was released in December 2024. Now it's being remade for flat-screens so that everyone can get in on the action, even if you're on a handheld. A great time for it to release, with Alien: Earth seeing the last episode release next week (which has been a great show in my opinion).</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TF79l6It5fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6b6a7ed333d2b6e2621988cc0752e32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TF79l6It5fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Made for <em>Alien </em>fans. Built for action-horror. Re-envisioned for PC.</p>
<p>Play as rogue Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks in the terrifying first chapter of a two-part saga set between the <em>Alien </em>and <em>Aliens </em>films. Sent to investigate a distress call on the remote planet Purdan, Zula uncovers a secret Weyland-Yutani blacksite overrun by deadly Xenomorphs.</p>
<p>Stalking, hunting, and attacking at every turn, these Xenomorphs' ferocity is matched only by their unpredictability. Aided by your synth companion, Davis 01, fight and survive using your weapons, skills, and sheer determination against a deadly Xenomorph incursion in this gripping original story.</p>
<p>Rebuilt for PC with stunning visuals, 60 fps, 3D audio, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> delivers a cinematic action experience that makes you truly feel like you’re inside the world of <em>Alien</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note, that this is only Part 1 and ends on a cliffhanger. Back when the VR version released, they failed pretty badly on the marketing and had to release a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1850050/view/520826430987174742" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> as it being only the first part was a surprise. Their prior communication on it was pretty poor. If you know it's an episodic game, it should have always been advertised as such. Anyway, hopefully the main PC release goes well so they do actually finish the next part - I would love a new proper Alien game.</p>

      <title>Digimon Story Time Stranger is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Digimon Story Time Stranger was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/digimon-story-time-stranger-rated-steam-deck-playable-steamos-compatible-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously rated Steam Deck Playable</a> but ahead of release this has been improved and it's now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Valve put it back through testing, and it appears the developer has solved the issue of it sometimes showing the wrong keybinds which was the only thing they noted as preventing it being Verified. Great news, as this one is sure to be a popular choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8998986391758268519gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8998986391758268519gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The compatibility notice still mentions it needs an internet connection for the first-time setup, plus it also has Denuvo Anti-Tamper listed on the Steam page.</p>

      <title>Stop Killing Games update - UK petition to see a debate in Parliament</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A short update for you on the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> movement - a UK petition is actually going to Parliament for a real debate.</p>
<p>The UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport did actually reply to the petition <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/uk-gov-responds-to-the-newer-stop-killing-games-petition-no-plans-to-amend-uk-consumer-law/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February 2025</a>, although the response was pretty much what was expected on these sorts of things giving a very wordy answer that basically boiled down to "nothing will change".</p>
<p>However, the petition did cross over the 100,000 threshold (189,888 total) to be <em>considered</em> for a debate in Parliament. Petitions that cross over this number are never <em>guaranteed</em> to see a debate, as they still have to actually be <em>selected</em>. Seems this has been popular enough that it now has been, and a date has been set for November 3rd, 2025 which will be shown on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/UKParliament" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UK Parliament YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprising though, considering the massive push for it in the EU that saw about <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en#" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1,448,270 signatures</a> of support, with the UK still pretty close with the EU some lawmakers have no doubt taken notice of what's going on there.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we'll see a proper adult debate on this, but I know how the UK goes with this sort of thing - but it's progress at least. Let's wait and see what happens. I'm not expecting any big surprises or sweeping changes, but at least the ball is rolling on it.</p>
<p>Really, a lot of this could be sorted by major publishers releasing server files to the community when they move on from games. Just look at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-crew-from-ubisoft-gets-revived-thanks-to-the-the-crew-unlimited-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Crew Unlimited community project</a> to show how it <em>can</em> be done.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are investing $5 billion in Intel to develop new chips together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge announcement for the entire computing industry came today, with NVIDIA and Intel teaming up to make new chips for data centre and consumers too. This is of course, largely about AI, and they want to ensure they stay ahead of AMD and Arm chip makers.</p>
<p>NVIDIA have been wanting to do some proper CPUs for a while, so it's no surprise that with this deal Intel will then be building custom CPUs for NVIDIA to use in data centres. But for personal computing, us normies, Intel plan to build " x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets".</p>
<p>That will be <em>very</em> interesting to see on the desktop, laptop and handheld gaming side. Can you imagine a future Steam Deck 3 that has an Intel CPU with NVIDIA RTX? Sure would be an interesting way for both Intel and NVIDIA to suck up some more of the market from AMD.</p>
<p>Their statements from the press releases:</p>
<p>“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”</p>
<p>“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Intel</a> and <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-intel-to-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a> press releases.</p>
<p>I should note, the deal is not complete yet. They need to go through regulator approval first as usual for such a big deal.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

      <title>Modding-friendly arcade racer Formula Legends is out now - works well on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have the need for speed but don't want to play one of the various full simulators, perhaps Formula Legends might be just the ticket you need. <em>You <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can't even play the latest F1 games on Linux</a> systems anyway.</em></p>
<p>With bright colourful and inviting visuals, this is a game designed for racing fans who find the serious sims just a bit <em>too</em> demanding. Formula Legends is a bit of a weird one though that sits somewhere between an arcade racer and a light simulator, because without any assists on it does feel a bit more like a proper sim but with controls and an overall feel that are a bit more like an arcade game - and when you turn on assists it's very much an arcade racer so you could call it a "sim-cade" racer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3_7zXatQjBA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d21ff87af2cc5add6603e8f7a7c431a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3_7zXatQjBA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the content and gameplay, I don't have a whole lot special to say about it. There's only 3 different game modes split across story mode, time attack and a custom mode where you can set things up how you like. All pretty standard stuff there for such a racer. The vehicles and tracks are only inspired by the real world too, as they don't have the licensing. So with the story mode (which doesn't exactly have any story) you just run through AI races using vehicles inspired by various eras.</p>
<p>Even with the more approachable nature of it, there's still a fair bit you need to keep an eye on when you're burning rubber. It has tyre wear, tyre grip, fuel consumption, damage simulation and weather conditions - all to keep you on your toes. There's even a tiny mini-game when you go into the pit to press a few buttons to get repaired and refuelled. </p>
<p>I really like that they're leaning into the modding community too. While other bigger racers stick in anti-cheat and try to protect their precious micro-transactions and such, this is a single-player modders delight (if a community builds up around to to make some that is). Although, modding support will come "soon" after launch.</p>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 9.0-4 it has been working perfectly, my PC hasn't broken a sweat with all the settings cranked up to max. Not overly surprising though, it's not exactly graphically demanding.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck gamers, even with the details all on "Very High" it will stick to nearly 60FPS. Just turn them down one notch to High and you should be absolutely fine on performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273461791758207802gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273461791758207802gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Formula Legends on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Don't go in expecting <em>any</em> multi-player features at all though, this is firmly designed as a single-player experience. And, honestly, that works against it. The AI drivers are…quite often complete morons. Completely bunching up, smashing into each other in groups around some corners and so on. If you're going to make a pure single-player racer, the AI needs to be better than this.</p>
<p>Aside from the racer stupidity, the actual racing is a real blast. The vehicles sound great, and mostly control great apart from some strange quirks at times with the handling. Soaring past opponents, and then attempting to stay on the track as I'm going way too fast for the corner. It's a challenge that still surprised me given the inviting nature of the game.</p>
<p>From the developer: </p>
<p>"We’ve all poured our hearts and souls into Formula Legends’ development," said Francesco Bruschi, CEO of 3DClouds. "We have been blown away by the positive response to the game from media, content creators and players, with launch being just the next step for us."</p>
<p>"We’ve designed Formula Legends to be fully mod-able - from the smallest in-game livery logo to entire car models and more," Bruschi added. "The PC version of Formula Legends can be easily decompiled and recompiled allowing the community to mod, tweak and create whatever they want and share their efforts with others. We can’t wait to see what they create!"</p>
<p>They have some big post-release plans too including:</p>

<p>Overall it's a fun time if you're in the market for a new racer that's hard to pin down where it belongs. Just keep in mind it's single-player only and the AI racers do need some tweaks to not be so stupid.</p>
<p>You're not going to be making your wallet cry with this one either at £19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99.</p>

      <title>Alabaster Dawn from the devs of CrossCode has a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radical Fish Games known for the awesome CrossCode have just put a demo for their next action-RPG with Alabaster Dawn now available to test.</p>
<p>Quite a unique demo because it's split across two parts. The first is the beginning of the game, and your save will carry on to the full game. The second part as an extra skips ahead to showcase a number of other game features along with a part of a dungeon. They say it should give 1.5 - 2.5 hours of play time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hL1zcGLwxG4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5541f54a40afc97f71fc9570c2ab9d1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hL1zcGLwxG4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alabaster Dawn</strong> is an Action RPG building on top of the best aspects of Radical Fish Games' previous title <strong>CrossCode</strong>, featuring a deep and engaging combat system, challenging puzzles and an epic story set in a curious world full of secrets to discover and places to explore.<br/>
<br/>
The shadow of Nyx has fallen, warping the world into a wasteland and vanishing the gods and their people. Now, Juno, the Outcast Chosen, awakens to an impossible task: <em>bring it all back.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>A (planned) 30-60 hours of playtime await you in this massive adventure, with 7 unique areas and many secrets to uncover. Rebuild settlements, establish trade routes and advance science by helping people. Each new advancement will be accompanied by the settlements changing visually, opening up new paths and opportunities!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game will have Native Linux support and the new demo does too. No release date set for the full game yet. Looks thoroughly to be worth a go though.</p>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast rated Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few hours before Dying Light: The Beast releases today, Valve put up a green tick for it to be Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible. There's no special notices about external gamepads or any online requirements, so hopefully that will make it easy to take it on the go and to dock to a TV too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9524350551758202649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's going to be a big release, with over a million pre-orders so this is exciting to see. However, performance is always a concern when it comes to bigger games like this. The Steam Deck Verified badge doesn't <em>always</em> mean the performance is actually where you would expect it to be, Valve are a bit inconsistent on the rating when it comes to overall performance. Mostly correct, but there's been a few definite odd cases that shouldn't be Verified.</p>
<p>The developers seem happy with it, since they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/787688820859471060" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the rating too. In their announcement Techland said: "Want to UNLEASH THE BEAST wherever, whenever? Well, you can because Dying Light: The Beast is Steam Deck Verified and fully optimized for smooth gameplay!".</p>
<p><em>I'm even more curious about it now.</em></p>
<p>Need a catch up? Techland released a new "The Story So Far" trailer you can view below:</p>

      <title>Hack the system and cause chaos in the explosive top-down shooter DeadWire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A top-down shooter where anything from cars, cameras, electronics and even enemy implants can be rewired into chaotic chains of destruction in DeadWire. Hack the planet? Hack the system? Cause some chaotic chains and it does look like things can get quite messy and fun.</p>
<p>Featuring more than thirty hand-crafted levels, and an additional score-chasing mode backed up with a slick synthwave soundtrack this is one for fans of Hotline Miami and other similar action games for sure.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>"One second players will be sprinting through a neon alley, the next, they’re rewiring a car, a CCTV camera, and unlucky guards into a chaotic chain-reaction." – said Arman, Solo Developer and Founder at Shotgun Anaconda. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Weapons with Personality: Slice your way through levels using blades, infinite Molotovs, empty an SMG into an enemy or simply trigger a perfectly timed hack      </li>
<li>Secrets for the Curious: Hidden routes, collectibles and time challenges keep completionists coming back </li>
<li>Atmosphere that Sticks: A neon-drenched city brought to life in with cyberpunk inspired pixel art</li>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.11 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters and players of the fheroes2 project, the open source reimplementation of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 for modern platforms!</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to present a new version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>1.1.11</strong></a> This release includes several major changes and many smaller but important updates.</p>
<p>First of all, map makers can now set any <strong>spells in Mage Guilds</strong> within Towns and Castles. This allows precise control of available spells and enables truly unique maps.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20861121981758197486gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20861121981758197486gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, map makers can ban specific spells in Mage Guilds so that they never appear, offering new ways of balancing the gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12078434231758197502gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12078434231758197502gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Secondly, map makers can select which monsters will appear in the <strong>Random Monster</strong> objects. Previously these objects generated completely random creatures, but now you can narrow down the selection - for example, to shooters only. This provides more control without reducing map replayability.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10879279871758197517gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10879279871758197517gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>During battles, the battle queue now highlights monsters with an <strong>outline</strong> when you hover the mouse over them, showing the order of their turns. It’s a small but helpful improvement when you're unsure of the turn order.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12633379191758197535gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12633379191758197535gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Among other UI changes, the team added <strong>icons</strong> for the Monster of the Week and Monster of the Month event dialogs, and the monster <strong>upgrade cost</strong> is now shown in the upgrade dialog.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10234898391758197558gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10234898391758197558gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21228635401758197559gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21228635401758197559gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In total, over 40 issues have been fixed since the last release.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this upgraded version of the engine, and we thank you for your continued support of the project!</p>
<p>Don't forget, that you also need to grab the data from <a href="https://gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">fheroes2</a> project on the GitHub page.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build words letter by letter, while using magical books to bend the rules potentially in your favour in the anagram roguelike Watchword. <em>Seems like it's taking a little flair from Balatro with the style.</em></p>
<p>Not just a roguelike but it's also a bit of a deck-builder, with you building up your letters and special relics to help or hinder your run. Each run through it is unique too, with the developer saying it's "endlessly re-playable", and you can even find ways to make up words in it too. As a roguelike there's also an upgrades and unlocks system where you can buy new items in a shop.</p>
<p>It also has Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>. Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Excellent theme park builder Parkitect gets a surprise Dinos &amp; Dynasties DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Texel Raptor just surprise launched a brand new DLC for the theme park building game Parkitect, adding in two new content themes. I have a real soft spot for Parkitect, a really great mixture of a building sim with casual business management and years later it still looks great. This sounds like an excellent excuse to go and jump back in.</p>
<p>This DLC adds in "two new themes, full of exotic and classical decorative objects to expand your park into new areas, along with some exciting new attractions". This includes dino-inspired objects to decorate your parks and a classical theme full of Roman and Greek themed decorations. There's also a free update that added in a new cheat window with sandbox tools enabling things like adding cash, changing the weather and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>The developer is currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261380/Croakwood/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Croakwood</a> which they say is a creative, relaxed town building simulation game about frogs and nature. No word on when it might release yet.</p>

      <title>GOG did a little upgrade to their user reviews system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DRM-free store GOG</a> have recently launched a bit of a refresh of their user reviews system, to make it a little bit more modern and useful. V<em>alve also recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/valve-announce-language-specific-user-review-scores-for-steam-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upgraded the reviews system on Steam</a> too.</em></p>
<p>GOG said it themselves that their review system "hasn’t been ideal" and they're aware of how important reviews are, so they decided to do a little something about it.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit or delete your reviews anytime</strong> (with timestamps to keep changes transparent).</li>
<li><strong>Better summaries</strong> with rating breakdowns at a glance.</li>
<li><strong>Your own review is always pinned on top</strong>, so you can find it right away.</li>
<li><strong>A dedicated “Reviews” tab</strong> on your profile (with the option to make it visible or hidden).</li>
<li><strong>Up to 8,000 characters per review</strong>, plus better formatting, smoother scrolling, and dark mode support.</li>
<li><strong>Improved reporting flow</strong> to help keep reviews fair and constructive.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think GOG need to do more on their reviews system? What's missing from it? Leave a comment and let us know what you think.</p>

      <title>GNOME 49 released with new video player, document viewer, improved app store and disabled X11 session</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 49 "Brescia" has been officially released today with improvements big and small across this popular Linux desktop environment.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights you can expect to see include <em>Showtime</em> their fancy new video player, that they say "prioritizes a distraction-free viewing experience" with some essential features like adjustable playback speed, multiple audio and subtitle tracks, rotating video, and screenshot capture. Another new app with<em> Papers</em> as their new document viewer that supports "viewing, searching, annotating, and organizing formats like PDF, DjVu, TIFF, and comic-book archives (CBR, CBZ, CBT, CB7), with added features such as digital signature integration".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3586941711758126238gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3586941711758126238gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Other changes include various improvements to the Calendar app for exporting events to a file and improved accessibility. The Web browser has better ad blocking, a site menu, enhanced security, better in-page search and more. The GNOME Software app store also has various performance improvements to greatly reduce memory usage and speed up parsing of Flatpak repositories like Flathub.

      <title>ZOE Begone! is a fab hand-drawn fusion of bullet hell with a run and gun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by drawn-on-film animation of the 1930s, ZOE Begone! masterfully blends together a bullet hell with a run and gun shooter and you need to check it out.</p>
<p>It certainly looks, feels and sounds the part too. The design of it is quite brilliant. Simple, but makes great use of a few screen effects, along with the film roll idea to really make it looks a bit like a retro animation reel and it really is charming to see in action.</p>
<p>Quite a challenge as well thanks to the controls, the design of the enemies and the health / energy system. You can run along the floor and shoot in 5 directions, or fly around but then only be able to shoot left or right. You'll be mixing between the modes constantly to avoid enemies and you really do have to pay attention to what's coming your way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21065084311758124835gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21065084311758124835gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Especially tricky when enemies come flying at you and you're running on the ground, as those 5 limited firing directions will often miss, so you'll be running and flying and then swapping back again constantly. It's always keeping you on your toes. The animator will also appear at times during a level with their brush, to draw on a squiggly line where various enemies spawn along and that can get a little frantic to deal with and has been the cause of quite a few failures in my run.</p>
<p>You also have dash and pound abilities. Dash allows you to smash through multiple enemies at the same time, which is often needed when they're stacked together and in your way. While pound is needed to grab extra energy for your dash and ammo for when your weapon is powered up, as well as grabbing more health. There's various orbs along the bottom of the screen which you pound into for your energy or health, which then does a fun background change where it paints a different colour - some sweet art design there.</p>
<p>Each level is also just like a rolling film, it keeps going and loops back on itself so you can really just keep on running and gunning until all the enemies are defeated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hn1RHUN6ZWU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d1fb800d763a868ef8f458586e45efcc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hn1RHUN6ZWU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you destroy all the different types of enemies, you'll also get drops of apples, which can be used in a shop that appears to enable some upgrades. These can be a more powerful gun, homing shots, a spreading shot and more.</p>
<p>Works perfectly on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton and it's great on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>If you usually enjoy twin-stick shooters this is one you don't want to miss. A great example of a game doing a lot with a little, really enjoyable to sink some time into and smash through it.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"ZOE Begone! is all about embracing imperfection - every jitter of ink, every ragged edge, every chaotic bullet," stated Graeme Hawkins, Retchy Games. "I hope players lean into that messiness, because for me, that’s where the magic lives."</p>
<p>"At PM Studios, we love championing creators who dare to be different; Graeme’s vision for ZOE Begone! is exactly that," says Ami Blaire, CMO, PM Studios. "It’s a perfect reminder of why indies matter, and we’re honored to launch it with Retchy Games."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Striking Hand-Drawn Visuals: </strong>Fully hand-drawn animations inspired by the animations of Norman McLaren and the golden age of arcade shooters.</li>
<li><strong>Enemy Chain Scoring System:</strong> Keep the action going with high-risk, high-reward chain combos, rewarding aggressive yet strategic gameplay. <br/>
<strong>Global Leaderboards: </strong>Compete with players around the globe (as well as yourself) to bag the highest score possible.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Upgrades:</strong> Choose between spending your Apples to gain new power-ups, weapons and abilities, or save them for game-altering updates later in a run - the choice is yours.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Modes:</strong> Switch between classic arcade runs, time-based challenges, and a high-octane boss rush; tackle the action however you want, and learn to master your favourite playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Multilayered Difficulty &amp; Combat:</strong> Fly or fight on foot across Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties—each with unique scoring potential and enemy patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Resource-Based Combat System:</strong> Manage your Energy to fly, dash, and pound through enemies—or trade it for short-lived, powerful weapons.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Line up the perfect shot to bump enemies in the wonderful and clever Flick Shot Rogues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Flick Shot Rogues is a turn-based tactical roguelike about flicking your characters across the map, to bump into enemies. It's clever and a new favourite. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>You've played with a deck of cards, you've dropped balls down boards filled with pins - but have you flicked your characters around a map like they're in a big crossbow before? Probably not. It's incredibly inventive with the game mechanics and really is a joy to play. Also works perfectly on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? A turn-based strategy roguelike where you fight across small arena boards by flicking your characters around, as they bounce off the walls and into enemies dealing damage.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644519451758115173gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644519451758115173gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Each character you control has different abilities and you only have one on the board at a time. You switch between them at any time before you flick them, so it's up to you to make the most out of each flick to properly use their abilities as best you can. It's not punishing in the difficulty, but it certainly can be a challenge when you have an assortment of enemies of the board with their own abilities too. You also have to constantly think about the turn after yours, for where you'll end up after your flick and what trouble you might land into with enemy movements.</p>
<p>During your run you also get to pick up powerful items, talents, curses and more with various effects that can be rather game-changing and perhaps even a little game-breaking at times when you become a bit ridiculously powerful on your flicks. Each run is fresh too since it's a roguelike with the enemies and items to collect being shuffled about. The setup is similar to Slay the Spire and FTL with you picking nodes on a map which could be a fight, a campfire to heal, an event and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-q0plGoBP_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9f840c5226e61352d91d5f4af13548b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-q0plGoBP_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Especially nice when you get a good trick-shot in, and manage to set off some chain reactions as you watch enemies burn and bump into each other to see the burning spread to others. And, as you progress you can unlock more characters for future runs too each with their own abilities.</p>
<p>One thing I do feel is missing is a clearer way to see how much damage you're going to deal or be dealt, especially versus how much health each enemy has. I love that in games like Slay the Spire, where you get shown what they're doing. Other than that, no issues with it at all. I enjoy the challenge of it, although some of the curses can be real tricky to deal with.</p>
<p>It really is supremely satisfying to get some good shots in on this one. It easily gets its teeth into you for that just <em>one-more-run</em> feeling. It feels quite like playing some sort of combat billiards, your mouse is the cue and your characters are your white ball to smash into the others.</p>
<p>This definitely gets the GamingOnLinux seal of approval. Go buy it and flick some people around.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Super-satisfying gameplay where you literally flick your hero into battle!</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical depth - make sure you always think ahead!</li>
<li>Unleash crazy combos as your attacks ricochet across the board!</li>
<li>Enemies and rewards reshuffle after each defeat!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is an excellent horde survival game - 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor 1.0 has now officially released, so you can deep dive into one of the best horde survival games around and dig for riches. Time for some more Rock and stone! <em>Note: I personally purchased it a good while ago, but was given early access to the release build.</em></p>
<p>Regular readers will know by now how I seem to have a complete fixation on anything Vampire Survivors inspired, I try to play anything resembling it in the horde-smashing genre <em>that we can never agree to a name on</em>. When I say it's one of the best, I really mean it. This has a great mixture of everything. And thanks to Proton, it runs great across Desktop Linux PCs and the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/401925011758112566gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/401925011758112566gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deep Rock Galactic on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>For those who haven't played it or any in the genre: you're one dwarf on a mission to mine for riches and upgrades. You go continually deeper through the Planet Hoxxes, mining through rocks and squishing every alien in the swarms that come running at you using your auto-firing weapons. Mining isn’t just a fluff feature here, it’s an important part of the game as it rewards exploration to find different ores needed for upgrades. You also need to mine-out specific areas for loot drops and to get away from swarms at times.</p>
<p>The key hook for these games are the build varieties, and how much you can ridiculously overpower your character to watch the fireworks. As you take down the bugs, they drop little experience orbs to pick up which allow you to level up and unlock some new weapons and upgrades.</p>
<p>Check out the new launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UFAHKmgswio"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cacfc036bf172999047b420f4a789df7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UFAHKmgswio" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What I especially like about this one is how descriptive it is. You always know what's going on and what's coming. There's a timeline always visible at the top of the screen, like a loading bar for your progress during a level. You know approximately how far away each swarm and boss is which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Once you finish a level, all is not well — as you need to actually escape by running to the drop pod that appears on the map. Easier said than done, especially when you're completely surrounded (which can easily happen if you're not paying attention). That's another thing to love about it, the action is seriously <em>intense</em> and when you have to run to the pod it's dramatically amplified. </p>
<p>Steam Deck performance could be a bit better though, I've seen it drop right down to 30FPS when it gets incredible intense. I hope this is something they will actually work on later to improve it. Overall still worth playing and fun enough there. No issues with performance on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>If you had played it previously, now is an excellent time to jump in as the progression has changed quite significantly. The new gear drop system does add some more features to make it worth it to keep coming back to it. You'll see gear drop during missions, and boss encounters can guarantee you a piece. You can then equip the gear <em>between</em> missions to give you various bonuses (and from the main menu for future runs). There's a really nice wide variety to the gear too and you can sell / upgrade specific gear and change them around any time.</p>
<p>Plus, a big new escort mission was also added, where you not only have to survive but protect a machine while it smashes through rock (players of the original Deep Rock Galactic will know it well).</p>

      <title>Soldat dev releases demo for Jackal, a brutal new top-down action game inspired by Hotline Miami</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Transhuman Design who made Soldat, King Arthur's Gold and Maniac is a fresh action game with Jackal and you can now try it early with the demo release. Like their previous releases, it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Before I even saw their noted inspiration, I immediately thought - this looks a bit like Hotline Miami. And that's just some of the inspiration that went into this one including OTXO, I Am Your Beast, John Wick, Cowboy Bebop and more. Enough about what they're taking from though, what's it all about then? The developer explains: "You're a drug-enhanced hitman with the moral compass of a broken slot machine, turning iconic Vegas hotels into impromptu abattoirs. Every table, chair, and kitchen utensil becomes a weapon in your hands because apparently, even the cutlery wants in on the action".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HKKExRvpKMY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d7c797b144c1a370c9d606bcf2ba0eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HKKExRvpKMY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every finisher a brushstroke. Every room a spectacle of carnage</strong> - Jackal is undoubtedly the most satisfyingly violent and unhinged murder simulator since Hotline Miami.</li>
<li><strong>From sofas to shotguns - everything is lethal</strong> - Become a coked-up John Wick who can turn an entire Vegas hotel into a stage for improvised carnage. </li>
<li><strong>Rhythmically Pleasant Frantic Violence</strong> - With drug-fueled superpowers rooms become physics kill boxes. From tables to kitchen utensils - everything is weaponized.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</li>
<li><strong>No two massacres are alike</strong> - Each raid is different with randomly generated rooms, unlockable drug superpowers, stackable gameplay mutators, an arsenal of brutal finishers, enemy types, iconic Las Vegas locations, weapons and weaponized items fueling endless creative carnage.</li>
<li><strong>Tarantino - Hunter Thompson - Palahniuk - Scorsese</strong> - Immerse in a psychedelic noir story where a hitman and his associate navigate a 1970s mob filled Vegas where every housecleaning job bleeds into the next and reality's just another bad trip.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for Kokoro Kitchen, a sweet farm-to-table cooking game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The 2.0 demo of the casual sweet farm-to-table cooking game Kokoro Kitchen is out now, and it really does look wonderful. It also has a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: Welcome to the spirit world! You might not remember how you got here, but don’t worry—Alan, the cutest (and grumpiest) poultry-geist, has a plan! In this farm-to-table cooking game help Alan restore a rundown Japanese restaurant, serve delicious meals, harvest fresh crops, and prepare special ingredients to meet all your customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer they recently put up too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KHjYmiIf6sQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/60515ad29310baee8d5dd82de8bd2981.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KHjYmiIf6sQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the 2.0 demo now live it covers 5 in-game days which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting cut scene and tutorial.</li>
<li>15 recipes.</li>
<li>8 upgrades.</li>
<li>1 very special NPC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this seems like a really nice mixture of gameplay features. A bit of casual farming with you planting, watering and harvesting ingredients and then you move it all through the restaurant. There's mini-games, you need to manage finances, an upgrade system, NPCs to talk to and do challenges for and much more.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck plugin adds AMD FSR4 support to improve visuals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You're supposed to only be able to use AMD FSR4 with the latest AMD GPUs, but thanks to a woops from AMD - even the Steam Deck can now use FSR4.<em> It's all a bit of a hack though and completely unsupported.</em></p>
<p>Back when AMD released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-4-fsr-4-now-available-for-all-developers-with-fidelityfx-sdk-2-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FidelityFX SDK 2.0 to include FSR4</a> for developers, they initially did a massive oops by including the full source code. Not something they can really take back either, as not only does the internet never forget but it was under an open source license before they scrubbed it.</p>
<p>Now, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nhkkr8/fsr_sdk_leak_contained_fsr_4_files_that_work_on/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AthleteDependent926</a> has caused quite a stir by compiling the DLL needed to allow AMD FSR4 on older AMD GPUs and sticking it online for anyone to use. And so, of course people are. For Steam Deck, it's especially nice, as older versions of FSR have some pretty jarring visual issues due to the low resolution.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck owners first you'll need to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-set-up-decky-loader-on-steam-deck-steamos-for-easy-plugins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">install Decky Loader using the GamingOnLinux guide</a> to get your Steam Deck ready to work with plugins. Then you can use the <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> which has just recently updated in version v0.11.15 to include it.</p>
<p>To install it you can follow the Decky Framegen Plugin install steps from their GitHub page (to ensure the newest version), which I've tweaked below to be hopefully clear enough</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go into Desktop Mode</strong>: STEAM button -&gt; Power -&gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
<li><strong>Download the Plugin</strong>: Look for "Decky-Framegen.zip" from the <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">releases page</a> via your web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Go back into Gaming Mode</strong></li>
<li><strong>Install the Plugin</strong>: In Decky Loader, select the "install from zip" option in developer settings.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5680579061758104045gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5680579061758104045gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6075732071758104043gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6075732071758104043gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup OptiScaler</strong>: Open the plugin and click "Setup OptiScaler Mod".</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5951073541758104086gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5951073541758104086gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure Games</strong>: For each game you want to enhance:

	<ul>
<li>Click "Copy Patch Command" in the plugin.</li>
<li>Go to your game's Properties → Launch Options in Steam.</li>
<li>Paste the command: <code class="inline-code">~/fgmod/fgmod %command%</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20719666861758104208gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20719666861758104208gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20634025971758104209gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20634025971758104209gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable Features</strong>: Launch your game and enable DLSS in the graphics settings</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Steam Input</strong>: Add the Insert key to one of the back buttons on the Steam Deck. You'll need it to open the OptiScaler settings overlay.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Settings</strong>: Once in-game, press the Insert key for OptiScaler settings to change modes.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will likely suck away a bit more power from the Steam Deck, but if you have a charger handy or you're docked to a TV, the visual bump compared to what you'll get with older FSR on Steam Deck appears to be worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10793334021758105514gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10793334021758105514gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20930199771758105515gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20930199771758105515gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on Steam Deck with FSR4</em></p>
<p>Pretty amazing to see, and only shows that AMD could if they wanted to, actually put up FSR4 for older GPUs officially. Naturally though, they want people to buy their latest tech.</p>

      <title>A second Hollow Knight: Silksong patch is ready for testing - here&#39;s the details</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Cherry clearly aren't slowing down on making improvements to the smash-hit Hollow Knight: Silksong, with a second patch already available to test. The first patch only released a few days ago on September 12th, and now there's an opt-in Beta test for the second.</p>
<p>As of two hours ago when <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the post</a> on Steam was last edited, these are the current patch 2 changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patch Notes</p>
<p>- Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.<br/>
- Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.<br/>
- Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.<br/>
- Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.<br/>
- Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.<br/>
- Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.<br/>
- Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.<br/>
- Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.<br/>
- Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.<br/>
- Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.<br/>
- Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.<br/>
- Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.<br/>
- Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.<br/>
- Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.<br/>
- Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.<br/>
- Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.<br/>
- Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.<br/>
- Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.<br/>
- Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.<br/>
- Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said to expect "a few more additions and tweaks before full release", so only jump in if you're willing to test and report back on it. Probably best not to throw you current run into a Beta.</p>

      <title>SteamOS support is being explored for the Lenovo Legion Go 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on what region you're in, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 might have already landed and it seems like SteamOS <em>might</em> come officially in future.</p>
<p>For the original Lenovo Legion Go and the new Legion Go 2, the only officially supported operating system is Windows 11. However, Lenovo did launch the Legion Go S with a SteamOS version officially supported but they've stayed pretty quiet about SteamOS for the Legion Go 2. The only note about it I've seen previously to now was a minor mention at the bottom of an article on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> where they were told simply "Lenovo isn’t announcing a SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 at this time".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10345405701758033467gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Lenovo recently did an AMA (Ask me anything) on Reddit, where the Lenovo Legion team were answering questions. And, of course, someone had to ask about SteamOS. From the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/necsj7t/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post by a Lenovo official:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the Legion Go Gen 2 is optimized for Windows to deliver broad compatibility and a full gaming experience out of the box, its open hardware platform allows for users to explore alternative configurations if they choose. We are exploring official support for SteamOS on the Legion Go Gen 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While usually you could mostly ignore such a comment, and put it down to the usual non-committal marketing speak, the fact that Lenovo <em>have</em> done a SteamOS machine before adds a bit more credit to it. They could have just continued to say no like they did to The Verge.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won't leave it too long if they plan to do it. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> to continue improving support for it to get Linux on it yourself.</p>
<p>The Legion Go 2 starts at £1,099.99.</p>

      <title>Funny dungeon crawler Lucky Tower Ultimate 1.0 arrives Q1 2026 with an extra content update coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lucky Tower Ultimate is truly a brilliantly silly dungeon crawler and one you need to play! The 1.0 has been announced for Q1 2026 and more content is coming.</p>
<p>If you haven't played it - you're missing out. It's slapstick comedy, so it's pretty daft and stupid but thoroughly charming at the same time. I really love diving into it to see all the encounters, and some of it really will make you laugh out loud or jump with surprise.</p>
<p>Since Q1 2026 is a while away to prevent people waiting too long, they've also revealed a new update is planned for sometime soon that will include "new items, new decorations, new traps, and new enemy variations" with the developer seeing how much they can cram into the update.</p>
<p>Their new 1.0 teaser is below:</p>

<p>The game works brilliantly on Linux PCs and Steam Deck (Verified) with Proton.</p>
<p>Priced at £12.99 / 14,99€ / $14.99 it has a Very Positive rating from players on Steam.</p>

      <title>Full Circle / EA confirm again that skate. will not support Linux, Steam Deck or macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>skate. from developer Full Circle and Electronic Arts (EA) is about to enter Early Access, and due to the anti-cheat there's no support for Linux / Steam Deck. <em>And macOS is out too.</em></p>
<p>This shouldn't be surprising news to regular GamingOnLinux readers as we <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-upcoming-skate-from-ea-will-be-unsupported-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-due-to-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered this back in July</a>, since this skating game is using the kernel-level EA Javelin anticheat. One of those anti-cheat systems that likely sends a shiver down the spine of anyone gaming on Linux PCs, Steam Deck or other handhelds running things like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3354750/announcements/detail/738149224958395252" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam with the specifications, they confirmed again:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MacOS, Linux are not supported.</li>
<li>While skate. will be Steam Native, Steam Deck will not be supported.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>By "Steam Native", they mean it doesn't additionally force the EA app.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect it to <em>ever</em> be supported either, not at least until the day Linux as a platform grows to a point where EA can't ignore it by blocking it like they also do for Apex Legends, Battlefield and more.</p>

      <title>Palworld 1.0 arrives next year with a huge update and plans to fix all the jank</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have revealed that Palworld 1.0 will arrive next year, with updates being quieter for the rest of the year while they fix all the quirks and jank.</p>
<p>In a video posted to their official YouTube account, their Communications Director and Publishing Manager spoke about the updates they've added previously and went onto explain plans for the future. They noted how there's "no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank" and that "we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game".</p>
<p>Later in the video they go on to mention the Winter update will not be as big as Feybreak due to their focus on fixing all the little issues. However, they have "a few surprises planned" for the Winter update this year. That, and there's a "truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update" as they're not slowing down.</p>
<p>Some teasers will be coming on the planned content to come.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tEVIBHP37eM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e721d1237fec7683bc91ece5eb9cf518.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also have more games to come from Pocketpair Publishing but no word on what yet.</p>

      <title>Call of the Void is an epic new Quake 2 Remastered crossover mod with Quake 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some Quake? You're not going to want to miss this one. Call of the Void is an impressive new crossover mod release for Quake 2. Designed to be fully compatible with Quake 2 Remastered it brings together the worlds of Quake 1 and Quake 2.</p>
<p>More about it: "Call of the Void" picks up where "Call of the Machine" leaves off. With our protagonist trapped in the void, they suddenly hear a voice in their mind. The entity speaking identifies itself as one of the ancient gods, Vadrigar, who proposes to the protagonist that they escape the void by sending them on a new mission for revenge against the Stroggs. This is in response to the Stroggs transforming the fallen Vadrigars (Chton and Shub-Niggurath) and their followers into partially mechanical creatures in the service of the Strogg leader Makron. Our protagonist will travel to a new, unknown dimension where levels from both Quake 1 and Quake 2 converge, and they will confront enemies from both franchises.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>18 new monstrous Strogg hybrid creations plus 2 new final bosses plus 11 Hybrids Prototypes.</li>
<li>Quake 1 Original monster roast ported to Quake 2 Remastered</li>
<li>A new campaign with 5 huge new maps mixing new and old scenarios from both franchises.</li>
<li>Made to be fully compatible with Quake 2 Remastered.</li>
<li>A new story that takes as its starting point the ending of the new official expansion "Call of the Machine."</li>
<li>Old monsters from Quake 1 adapted to the new Quake 2 Remastered.</li>
<li>Source code and FGD file available for the community to expand content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5jkpK4swtuo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa95e59e65e9229d13de9958a73beceb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5jkpK4swtuo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-ii-call-of-the-void" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mod DB</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/call_of_the_void" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to run it on Linux with Quake 2 Remastered using Proton from Steam, it's quite simple. Just extract the mod folder contents from the zip file into the "rerelease" folder inside where you installed Quake 2. So the "q1q2" folder sits next to "baseq2". Then add this launch option to Quake 2 inside Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">+set game q1q2</code></p>
<p>You'll then be able to select Call of the Void in the New Game menu.</p>

      <title>GPD WIN 5 highlights support for running Bazzite Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming pricey and strangely designed GPD WIN 5 is coming later this year, and it's now confirmed to have support for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> Linux.</p>
<p>Bazzite is a popular choice of Linux for handhelds, with its SteamOS-like appearance but offers up advanced hardware and software support. On the <a href="https://gpd.hk/gpdwin56773453f" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a> for the GPD WIN 5, they actually repeatedly highlight its support for Bazzite. However, the tech specs show it will still be shipping with Windows 11, so this is again a bring your own Linux if you want a change on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/704284781758013291gol1.png"/></p>
<p>On their official product page they talk about using Bazzite to make the "Ultimate Steam Gaming Handheld" and the "Ultimate Steam Gaming Console" when docking.</p>
<p>I'm not particularly fond of GPD hardware, or how they've previously acted as a company (like blocking GamingOnLinux on social media for pointing out they were pinching YouTube videos without credit or permission), but found it interesting to see how Linux as a gaming platform continues expanding across other hardware vendors.</p>
<p>The GPD WIN 5 is just a weird device. Powerful? Sure, but there's <em>no</em> internal battery. You either play with it plugged in, or stick it into an external battery pack designed for the device which makes it quite bulky.</p>
<p>Just look at how odd this is:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SszpQ_zzcos"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e111b92e367fcb81438cc905f70494aa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SszpQ_zzcos" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T0vd_38tB_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4830b69bdfc10c8231e7c21b63d57a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T0vd_38tB_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's even sillier, is this external battery doesn't come as standard, it's a separate purchase.</p>
<p>It will come with either the AMD Ryzen Al Max+ 395 (AMD Radeon 8060S) or AMD Ryzen Al Max 385 (AMD Radeon 8050S), with either 32GB / 64GB / 128GB RAM (Quad Channel LPDDR5x 8000 MT/s) with either 1TB / 2TB or 4TB storage.</p>
<p>Definitely not a device I would be going for, I prefer my portables to be actually properly portable without the <em>requirement</em> of attachments. It's just a thoroughly confusing device. Much like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-lenovo-legion-go-2-launches-in-october-its-heavier-and-very-pricey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go 2</a> which is also heavier and pricey, handheld gaming definitely seems to go going in the wrong direction with some companies.</p>
<p>The GPD Win 5 is coming to <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld/coming_soon" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding sometime soon. It's likely to be priced around US $1,400.</p>

      <title>The Crew from Ubisoft gets revived thanks to the The Crew Unlimited project</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Crew can now live on thanks to the community, after Ubisoft completely shut it down the The Crew Unlimited project has released to keep it alive.</p>
<p>If you still have a copy somewhere that is, since Ubisoft no longer have a way for new players to legitimately access it. Still, this is an important project for game preservation. Truly is a shame that bigger publishers just decide to dump games like Ubisoft did with The Crew, projects like this show what's possible with a little extra effort. Ubisoft could have clearly done something like this themselves but chose not to.</p>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Crew Unlimited website</a>.</p>
<p>The original shutdown is what led to the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> movement that's continuing its push to get laws amended to hopefully prevent publishers just leaving people with entirely broken games in future. Verification of signatures for the EU campaign is currently underway, and from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post "early reports from several countries show around 97% of signatures being valid" which is great. They're also continuing to work in the background to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".</p>

      <title>AMDVLK has been discontinued as AMD are throwing their &#34;full support&#34; behind RADV</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have announced the end of AMDVLK, their official open-source Vulkan driver and will instead now be focusing on the much more popular RADV.</p>
<p>Most people gaming on Linux will likely be using RADV anyway, since Mesa comes as pretty much the standard on Linux distributions and has Valve's backing too with it being the graphics driver used on SteamOS.</p>
<p>On the official AMDVLK GitHub, an <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/discussions/416" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> was posted by AMD's JianRong JIN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a move to streamline development and strengthen our commitment to the open-source community, AMD is unifying its Linux Vulkan driver strategy and has decided to discontinue the AMDVLK open-source project, throwing our full support behind the RADV driver as the officially supported open-source Vulkan driver for Radeon™ graphics adapters.</p>
<p>This consolidation allows us to focus our resources on a single, high-performance codebase that benefits from the incredible work of the entire open-source community. We invite developers and users alike to utilize the RADV driver and contribute to its future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about RADV: <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa RADV Documentation</a></li>
<li>Contribute to the code: <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tree/main/src/amd/vulkan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa GitLab Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited about this focused path forward and are committed to the continued success of open-source Vulkan on Radeon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result they've also archived the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/pal" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page for PAL (Platform Abstraction Library), the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/gpurt" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for their GPU Ray Tracing Library and others related.</p>
<p>I'm quite excited by their mention of throwing their "full support" at RADV, which will hopefully mean actually providing some resources for the Mesa driver to improve.</p>
<p>What do you make of this news?</p>

      <title>The cute co-op game LEGO Voyagers has released and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO Voyagers is the cutest looking co-op game and it's available today, along with it getting Steam Deck Verified for the release. So it will work great on other Linux / SteamOS systems too. Created by Light Brick Studio, who also made LEGO Builder's Journey.</p>
<p>The initial release had a bit of a blip with people not being able to play, as it was showing as the Friend's Pass version, the developers have already solved this before publishing the article. The Friend's Pass is a nice system, allowing you to jump into the game with a friend, so only one of you need to purchase it. I wished my co-op games had something like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1J4Zq-A6FAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b90a59ccdbb5f102486dd9c4e4dc22e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
</li>
<li>Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really need to get finished with our play-through of It Takes Two, as this looks wonderful and will no doubt be the next game we co-op over here.</p>

      <title>Car combat game FUMES improves support for controllers and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FUMES really is awesome and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam which it gained quickly after release, and the developer keeps improving it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HvQr6nI5mdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50a650fe3538e1b1b08337fe3565ec2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HvQr6nI5mdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the most recent Early Access update, they've focused on making it a lot more playable on controllers and the Steam Deck. Most menus now have proper controller navigation and so it should feel a lot better now. Additionally, they've made these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added gamepad navigation to menus.</li>
<li>Added rumble/vibration for gamepads (can be adjusted in settings).</li>
<li>Added missing input glyphs.</li>
<li>Adjusted font sizes on some UI to make text more readable on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Various buttons remapped. Because of this we had to reset controls setting - adjust them if needed.</li>
<li>Rework of controls remapping UI to make it easier to use.</li>
<li>Added separate controls categories for gameplay, menus and photo mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An auto-aim feature is also coming to help with gamepads, but that's for a future update they said. Steering wheel support is also experimental but they said with this update it should be "much more usable now". There's also some bug fixes, UI improvements, changes to how loot works and more.</p>
<p>For the upcoming updates they're planning to work on continued controller improvements, achievements and getting Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>DRAGON BALL GEKISHIN SQUADRA works great on Linux PCs and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bandai Namco Entertainment released DRAGON BALL GEKISHIN SQUADRA, a free to play MOBA set in the Dragon Ball universe and it works well on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be any anti-cheat problems with this one, and no anti-cheat is actually noted on the Steam page and in my testing <em>everything</em> seemed to work without issues with Proton 9.0-4. It's a free to play game, and so of course - there's micro-transactions. They want you to pump some coin into it to help unlock more characters and skins for your account, so it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12704155011757932701gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12704155011757932701gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5668571901757932703gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5668571901757932703gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a MOBA, it does a pretty competent job at the gameplay with mixing in the Dragon Ball characters and compared with the likes of Dota 2, it's incredibly accessible and simple to get into. From the games I've played and completed, I've surprisingly really enjoyed it. The mixture of characters, the world and all the abilities do make for quite a fun and engrossing time. Especially since it works great with a gamepad, I can sit back and chill with it.</p>
<p>Since it's a MOBA, it's a hero battler. You pick a lane on the map, and fight through taking down specific enemies that act as the towers, while the opposing team tries to do the same to you. You'll battle various AI enemies to help your character level up, and fight other real players directly too. All in the name of trying to get to the opposite team's base, to steal their Dragon Ball and win the match.</p>
<p>Chaotic too at times when you're battling multiple opponents, and you're all firing off these huge abilities, you can definitely get a bit lost in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4402172701757934113gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4402172701757934113gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19646213981757934115gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19646213981757934115gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance on max settings has been without a problem, even with all the action going on with multiple characters fighting and throwing all their abilities into it - I've seen a very smooth 120FPS. Not exactly surprising though, the graphics aren't exactly pushing anything, especially as it was made for mobile too so I expected this to run well anyway. Even on lower-end machines you shouldn't have many issues with the performance in this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6176654931757934263gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6176654931757934263gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15339590151757934265gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15339590151757934265gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since I was enjoying it on Desktop Linux, I checked it out on Steam Deck as well to see if it would make a good competitive multiplayer game for the Steam Deck. Especially since the controller support is perfect on Desktop, I would have thought it would make a great Steam Deck game — and it is!</p>
<p>Appears to be a solid 60FPS on the default settings (everything on High or Max) on Steam Deck without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14548465981757935389gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14548465981757935389gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7545601291757935391gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7545601291757935391gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Deck screenshots</em></p>
<p>From my time testing it out, this really does look like a great fit for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, it does have a major problem.</p>
<p>You'll probably find that quite a few of your games <em>can't</em> be finished as someone quits. It's seriously abrupt too, the game just pauses with a message about it and after a few seconds that's it - game over. So if anyone has a connection problem, or rage quits - that's your game done. Very annoying.</p>
<p>The trailers also barely show any gameplay at all but here they are:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fDJ_ICPUQRE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6ff727acddbbc9abbaf96b8fed71989.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fDJ_ICPUQRE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ojhY1xAAQyc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2d517eee054869a246bab33bff8d27a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ojhY1xAAQyc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a free to play MOBA, my main concern is: how long will it live? It does currently (at least on Steam) have a somewhat healthy player-base. But these types of games don't tend to last overly long on PC. At least in this case it has cross-platform play across Steam, Switch, PlayStation, iOS and Android so it might last.</p>

      <title>Super Mario Bros Remastered open source fan project brings an impressive remake to PC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nintendo likely won't be happy about this one, so get it while it's hot, Super Mario Bros Remastered is out now and open source. It doesn't actually include the original assets from the classic Nintendo games, so you need to supply that yourself with a ROM. That might keep it out of reach for Nintendo lawyers, but probably not.</p>
<p>Anyway, this open source fan project is free, open source and made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>. So could even be a nice way for others to learn to hack away with Godot to make something. Or just, play Mario on PC.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy gets a big upgrade and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World continue improving the recent S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy release, with version 1.3 out for all three titles. The pack includes S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat - Enhanced Edition, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky - Enhanced Edition and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chornobyl - Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>Gamers on Steam Deck will appreciate it, as they've overhauled the fonts to make them "more familiar to veteran stalkers and increased font size for better readability on Steam Deck". On top of that they also fixed "mouse simulation gyroscope support for better experience on Steam Deck". Nice to see a little extra effort there.</p>
<p>There's also a useful new quick slots system that was added for Shadow of Chornobyl (SoC) and Clear Sky (CS), which functions that same as Call of Prypiat (CoP) but it seems like you have to manually enable it in the game settings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2560436151757930132gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Other than that, it's a really long list of issues that have been fixed and other general improvements. To save you a click here's the whole lot below:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>What’s New</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>QoL Feature</strong>: Added quick slots for <em>Shadow of Chornobyl</em> (SoC) and <em>Clear Sky</em> (CS), functioning the same as in <em>Call of Prypiat</em> (CoP).<br/>
<br/>
	Open the settings menu</p>
<p>Proceed to “Game” tab</p>
<p>Use “Enable quick slots” checkbox to toggle the quick slots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed mouse simulation gyroscope support for better experience on Steam Deck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added auto-switching between gamepad and keyboard input on consoles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong>: Major overhaul to make fonts more familiar to veteran stalkers and increased font size for better readability on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Mate&#39;Morphosis is an upcoming chess-inspired puzzle game about becoming the piece you capture</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What have they done to chess? Mate'Morphosis warps it into a puzzle game where you become the piece you capture where you constantly have to adapt.</p>
<p>You have to navigate one single piece to capture the queen, and since you turn into whatever you capture, every move will change the game so you have to really plan ahead with this one. Love the idea of it and it looks good too, with a nice simple style to get the point across.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2v9uU2IKSQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9946497f89a35be0e620fc41d0486816.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2v9uU2IKSQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Morph</strong> - Pawns become knights, knights become bishops; your route evolves with every move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolving mechanics</strong> - Fresh mechanics beyond chess keep boards surprising from start to Mate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hand-crafted challenge</strong> - tight levels with a steady difficulty climb and clean, readable pixel art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instant learning loop</strong> - quick restarts and fast pacing make puzzle experience painless.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Play your way</strong> - A lot potential moves. <em><u>well kinda</u>.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be released in November.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire 2 delayed and now arrives March 2026 - nothing to do with Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slay the Spire 2 was originally due in Early Access this year, but the developers have announced it's moving into March 2026. Made with Godot and with plans for full Linux support, I'm excited and I do hope the extra time will allow them to make the best of it. The original was simply amazing!</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> post on the original game's store page, they said there's no big dramatic reason as to why. It's down to a mixture of their personal lives (everyone is fine) and they kept saying "wouldn't it be cool if..." too many times so they just need more time to get it ready.</p>
<p>They also put up an official FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is the real reason for the delay the timing of the Silksong release?</strong><br/>
We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong’s date was announced. The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Is the real reason for the delay that you’ve been spending your time on making merch/community events/etc?</strong><br/>
Our merch is made by 3rd party partners and our community manager is the primary liaison on our team for collabs like that. No game development was harmed in the making of those plushies! Likewise, anything community-focused that we create, participate in, or promote is generally handled by the CM and doesn’t cut into any game development time.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>So is it because you’re adding in a bunch of new features and content?</strong><br/>
Yes, in part. Because you know what does cut into game development time? Game development! Compared to Slay the Spire 1's early access launch (and for that matter it's final 2.0 form) this new sequel has a lot more content that we can't wait to share with you. In addition, we want to make sure we're upholding the quality bar that both we and the gaming community have come to expect for Early Access titles.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>So what’s so different from StS1?</strong><br/>
In case you haven’t been keeping up with our trailers and Neowsletters–quite a lot. There are new characters, more cards/potions/relics/events/etc, more visual polish, more animation and VFX, quality of life changes, entirely new mechanics, and still a whole lot more we can’t tell you about just yet. Although, if you read on to the next section you'll learn about a pretty big one...<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When was the game originally planned to launch?</strong><br/>
2025! Ok, but in all seriousness, we were initially aiming for a Fall 2025 release window. For now, we’ll just have to savor these moments of anticipation a little longer.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Will this be anything like other games that get repeatedly delayed with no explanation?</strong><br/>
No, for one thing, you should never expect radio silence from us. That’s why we’re here talking to you now. And, as opposed to a general release year, we have an actual specific date that we’re aiming for internally and are confident we can hit this time. As you've already heard, it’s releasing on a Thursday, but the exact date will be revealed closer to launch.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>So, do you regret the “Still coming in 2025” gag at the end of the TGA trailer?</strong><br/>
Demi, the CM, who is writing this, pushed for that one so she can take the fall for it. In her defense, it was pretty funny at the time.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.15 released bringing Unicode 17 and some initial NTSYNC work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.15 has rolled out as the latest development release on the Windows compatibility layer towards eventually the Wine 11 release next year. <em>And then eventually Proton 11 too for Steam from Valve.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights from the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.15" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicode character tables updated to Unicode 17.0.0.</li>
<li>Zip64 support in Packaging services.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking closer, there's some initial NTSYNC work that made it into Wine directly now too, although it's still not all of it yet as some of it is being reworked to fit properly.</p>
<p>As for bug fixes they've noted issues solved for wow64 in multiple games, Sims 2, Wayland improvements, Steam, CapCut and mire.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 issue on Steam Deck / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 players on Steam Deck and SteamOS may have noticed recently it appeared like it uninstalled itself, here's what's going on.</p>
<p>Writing on Bluesky, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais simply <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lyrpgnaf7s2m" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fix has been deployed for the Baldur's Gate 3 install issue. May have to restart Steam Deck for it to pick up the new configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game from what I understand <em>wasn't</em> actually uninstalled, it just <em>looked</em> like it due to a change on Steam's backend configuration. However, players may not have been able to actually get it to reinstall to pick it up either.</p>
<p>A little background info — currently, Baldur's Gate 3 runs the Windows version through the Proton compatibility layer to make it playable on Linux systems like Steam Deck with SteamOS. However, it seems like the developer Larian Studios are working on a Native Linux version specifically for the Steam Deck, which you can see in the depots on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/depots/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> with a Native Linux version set for Steam Deck only (if a depot is set for Steam Deck it's <em>not</em> available on Desktop Linux).</p>
<p>What happened is that Valve's automatic Steam Deck Verification ended up picking this up, and setting the Native version as the default (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/history/?changeid=31089396" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). Even though it's not yet public and hasn't been announced, which caused problems with players who have it currently installed. I've seen this issue before with Deck Verified testing and approving a Beta release for a different game, it just seems to be an issue Valve need to solve to separate somehow between public and non-public builds of games.</p>
<p>So Valve have now just put a separate <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=31100695" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">configuration</a> on Baldur's Gate 3 to force it onto Proton, which is likely to be removed if / when Larian release the special Steam Deck Native Linux build if Valve's retesting then shows it to be better to set that as the actual default.</p>

      <title>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined announced for February 2026, already rated Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined has been revealed and it will be launching February 2026, and we already have Valve testing it on Steam Deck ahead of release.</p>
<p>Valve have given it a Steam Deck Playable rating due to some in-game text being too small, which is an easy problem for the developer to solve between now and the February 5th 2026 release date. Valve also note the first-time setup requires an internet connection. On top of that the Steam page notes it also has Denuvo Anti-tamper.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Diorama Brought to Life</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined blends a beautiful diorama art style with Akira Toriyama's iconic character designs to make every encounter feel vibrant, heartfelt, and full of adventure. From lush forests and bustling towns to ancient ruins and whimsical monsters, every environment is bursting with color and personality.</p>
<p><strong>Travel through History to Restore the Present</strong></p>
<p>Scattered stone fragments unlock portals to long-lost eras with their own challenges to solve. Restore the islands, solve mysteries, and make allies in the past to breathe life back into the present.</p>
<p><strong>A Beloved Tale with a Streamlined Narrative</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined is told through a series of vignettes with an overarching narrative. The main story has also been streamlined to make the journey more accessible to all players.</p>
<p><strong>Classic Combat, Improved!</strong></p>
<p>The battle system in DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined has undergone significant changes. Turn the tides of battle with new vocational perks. Each vocation has its own unique ability, from all-out attacks to those that support your allies. Battle speed adjustments and an auto-battle feature are also available. Battles can progress without interruptions between each turn, depending on the tactics selected for the protagonist and allies. While on the field, players can pre-emptively strike monsters and instantly defeat them If the monster is weaker than the party.</p>
<p><strong>Moonlight and Level Up Two Vocations at the Same Time!</strong></p>
<p>Customize your playstyle with the new Moonlighting mechanic. Having two vocations assigned at once provides access to the skills, magic spells, and unique perks from both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's up for pre-order for £49.99 and the Deluxe Edition has Advanced Access to play it 2 days early.</p>

      <title>Steel Knight&#39;s ARMIS turns Vampire Survivors into an anime inspired mecha shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Could be a fun twist for the genre. Steel Knight's ARMIS takes the ideas of Vampire Survivors with the upgrade system and tweaks it to be like a mecha anime.</p>
<p>It has a number of twists to help set it apart from all the other survivor-likes, and it could be one to watch. There's a demo available to try right now that works perfectly with Proton on Desktop Linux and it's set for release on October 8th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4815315301757687370gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4815315301757687370gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8545631731757687616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8545631731757687616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it has the traditional survivor-like gameplay of tackling enemy hordes, auto firing weapons, collecting orbs and selecting upgrades constantly when you level up - what sets it apart is the overall structure of it.</p>
<p>Since it's inspired by classic mecha anime, it has a story to progress through various chapters. With all sorts of pilot and enemy chatter going on during the missions. That, and the gameplay will switch between you flying around destroying enemies in a basic area map into a vertical shoot 'em up mode, so it keeps things feeling quite fresh.</p>
<p>They also have a new gameplay trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efLigPvMb70"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/910b2be1df6bfdff4a8f62cdb0ee968a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efLigPvMb70" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only part of it that I didn't particularly like, was the constant chatter for the story during the battles. The battles are pretty hectic, and you simply don't get time to read what they're saying (the audio is in Japanese). If they had tweaked that to be more between battles, it would have worked a lot better. At least, until half way through just the first mission, becoming so powerful I could just sit still and then I could read all the chatter. <em>Seems they have some balancing to do as it does get quite easy.</em></p>
<p>Overall it feels like a really unique blend of ideas so give it a shot and see what you think in the demo.</p>

      <title>Catch bugs and fight both sides of the battles in Dicey Bugs - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dicey Bugs is a cute looking roguelite bug-catching strategy game, it just released from ProdigalSon Games and has Linux / Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>A little different to other catching games, with you controlling both sides of the battles which is a little weird sounding at first. It's all about maximising what you want to achieve in each battle using your dice <em>and</em> your enemy dice, to grow your collection of bugs. The idea of putting them in little jars to capture them was a sweet touch I thought.</p>
<p>During the game you get to customize your team of recruited bugs along with what dice you take with you all in the name of gaining new abilities, chain attacks and more as you progress further to capture more elusive bugs.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7_I42ZZbPe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aad19ac69aa1e4b5d2219ab44011f781.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7_I42ZZbPe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a demo available. The latest update to the game and demo in August before release added Steam Deck support, with it already having a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>If you love creature collecting and want a different kind of challenge - this is it.</p>

      <title>Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon looks great in the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the style of 90s animation, Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon really does look great with the blend of action-platforming and some huge enemies.</p>
<p>The artwork going into this is really awesome, and some of the animations look really fun too, especially with what looks like some of the boss battles. Appears very much to be a platformer that will be well-worth picking up when it releases with Linux support (no current date yet though). For a little background on it be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/interview-with-outofthebit-on-their-cinematic-platformer-nanuka-secret-of-the-shattering-moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out the previous GamingOnLinux interview with the team</a>.</p>

      <title>You have to try the demo for Berserker&#39;s Domain if you love boomer shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Berserker's Domain seems like it's going to rock when it's released! A shooter inspired by Quake, Doom, ULTRAKILL, and Blood with a roguelike twist. The developer just recently put up a demo (works with Proton) and it's a bloody good time.</p>
<p>With some smooth fast-paced action and fun level design, along with the variety of upgrades and the roguelike loop to it with you picking your path — it has a fun blend and I think you're going to enjoy this one. I can definitely see the inspiration between ULTRAKILL and Doom on this one, not that it's a bad thing, it wears it with clear pride.</p>
<p>Check out the demo release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fsTMLO--MM4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0cd7398e664acd308f3a555fdbfae62e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fsTMLO--MM4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Run, dash, and double-jump around the battlefield at break-neck speed, tearing through swarms of cultists, demons, monsters, soldiers, sorcerers, and demigods.</li>
<li>Wield a brutal arsenal of nasty-ass weapons, each with a bunch of nonsense upgrades.</li>
<li>Unlock ultimate "synergy upgrades" that combine bonuses from different weapons. Want a Dynamite that explodes into shotgun pellets? Sure, why not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Press the Play button and you're shooting stuff in 5 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>No menus, no waiting for load screens, no tutorials. Just run the game and have fun.</li>
<li>Each death starts a new, randomized run with fresh maps, weapons, upgrades, and enemies. No two runs are ever the same.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Anti-cheat looks like a no-go on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck for Arena Breakout: Infinite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite releases soon from Morefun Studios and sadly, this is yet another online multiplayer title that will not work on Linux / SteamOS.</p>
<p>It's going to be using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), which is one of the most annoying anti-cheat systems when it comes to supporting Linux. Multiple games as listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a> use it and either only work on Steam Deck or don't work at all.</p>
<p>On their official FAQ post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980686979" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Does the game support Linux or Steam Deck?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, not at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't get much clearer than that.</p>
