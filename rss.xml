      <title>TUXEDO Sirius 16 launches full AMD gaming notebook with Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next hardware purchase? How about a new Linux notebook that's all-in with AMD? The TUXEDO Sirius 16 looks delicious.</p>
<p>"Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and a binary star system. With the new Sirius 16 - Gen1, TUXEDO is breaking new ground and launching the first and long-awaited full AMD Linux gaming notebook named after the celestial body, especially since the TUXEDO Sirius 16 is also powered by a particularly exciting binary star, consisting of the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and the AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT." — TUXEDO Computers</p>
<p>What you get here is quite the powerhouse with a 16.1 inch 2560x1440 display, with a 165Hz refresh rate. Backed up by the 8 cores and 16 threads from the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, a large 80 Wh battery, 2x 8 GB DDR5-5600 RAM and 1x 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png"/></a><br/>
Pictured - TUXEDO Sirius 16</em></p>
<p>As you might be able to tell from the image above it has a colour-adjustable light bar on the front edge as well as a per-key RGB-backlit keyboard for those of you who like things a little less plain.</p>
<p>Plenty of room for upgrades during configuration or <em>after</em> purchase with the ability to up it to 96GB RAM, and they say it has two easily accessible M.2 slots when you remove the base tray, which is covered by their warranty, so you can configure it up to 2 x 4TB SSDs with a fast PCIe 4.0 connection.</p>
<p>As for connectivity you get 2 x USB-C (1x USB 4.0 Gen3x2, 1x USB 3.2 Gen2 (40 Gbps each)), 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen2 (10 Gbps each), HDMI 2.1 and RJ45 LAN (1 Gbps). It also has a webcam shutter and a fingerprint sensor (although that only apparently works on Windows).</p>
<p>You can choose to have it with their own Tuxedo OS (based on Ubuntu) or with Ubuntu 22.04, Kubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu Budgie 22.04. Pricing starts at 1,699 EUR for the base model. They said the expect the first deliveries around mid-December 2023.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 full steam ahead with only one showstopper left for Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As the KDE team continue working full steam ahead towards Plasma 6, they're now down to a single showstopping bug for having Wayland by default. Written up in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/11/24/this-week-in-kde-the-plasma-6-feature-freeze-approaches/" target="_blank">blog post</a> as usual by developer Nate Graham, recent work for readying Plasma 6 sounds great.</p>
<p>The last bug considered a showstopper is "<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444335" target="_blank">Full sticky keys functionality does not work under Wayland</a>", so once that's solved they will consider it ready to be default. There's various other bugs of course, with lots of users now testing and reporting from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/kde-plasma-6-gets-a-first-alpha-release/" target="_blank">huge Plasma 6 Alpha release</a> but mostly minor issues.</p>
<p>Another important issue that has now been solved is that Plasma on Wayland will now actually prompt you about unsaved changes in apps, instead of just rebooting or shutting down and allowing you to lose your work. Thankfully no Wayland protocol changes were needed for this.</p>
<p>Found an app behaving badly? The "Kill unresponsive window?" is now fully online on Plasma Wayland and got a modern UI face-lift.</p>
<p>Something else that's been changed that sounds useful is that when you upgrade to Plasma 6 from Plasma 5, if there's Widgets you were using that aren't API compatible it will be shown in a "user-friendly way" so you don't think it's all just broken.</p>
<p>A reminder on the roadmap for Plasma 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to seeing everything Plasma 6 has to offer up at release next year for my desktop. And eventually on Steam Deck when Valve pull it into a future SteamOS upgrade for the desktop mode.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular you're looking forward to in Plasma 6?</p>

      <title>Over 5% of The Pale Beyond players were on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting little data point for you, as the developers behind the polar exploration and survival game The Pale Beyond have given an update on Steam Deck engagement with their game.</p>
<p>In a recent video from Bellular Studios, who run the Bellular News YouTube channel, they showed off that 5.28% of players overall were on Steam Deck. The video went up on Nov 24th, 2023 and it's mentioned they're recent stats and Michael mentions in the video how they were "absolutely god damn shocked just how many people were playing on Steam Deck".</p>
<p>The Steam Deck bit starts around 4:37 which is where the video embed below should start:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aghkxdkzX_c?rel=0&amp;start=277"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c4badac7eae11792f25a981dd79d9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aghkxdkzX_c?rel=0&amp;start=277" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's interesting though is this is not the first time I've covered it. Looking back on it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-pale-beyond-sold-10-of-copies-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">they also said back in March</a> this year how Steam Deck sales were at 10% but that was quite early on after release and the game has now been out for around 9 months. Seeing over 5% of players actually being on Steam Deck though seems like a pretty good number, and far above macOS.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-pale-beyond?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266030/The_Pale_Beyond/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's rated <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"> Steam Deck Verified and it's also Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1266030" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</img></p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I adore creature collecting games and Portal Fantasy looks and sounds like it could be quite an interesting spin on the genre, with you creating worlds for people to explore.

<p>Their trailer is pretty fun to watch too, really got me excited to try it out:</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton 2.11 released with DirectX Raytracing enabled by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An exciting release of VKD3D-Proton has arrived! VKD3D-Proton 2.11 brings with it some big improvements for the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used in Valve's Proton for Linux PC and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First big change is that DXR is now enabled by default, no more needing to set "VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr" as that is the default. However they note a few special cases where it is not. Sampler feedback is also now supported through emulation, and thanks to this DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) is also now exposed by default on RDNA2+ and Turing+.</p>
<p>There's also various performance fixes, new workarounds for game issues and a few general bug fixes. All the rest available below in the full changelog:</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>Features</h3>
<h5>DXR enabled by default</h5>
<p><code class="inline-code">VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr</code> is default now, and no longer needed.<br/>
There are some special cases where DXR is not enabled by default. The only such current example is<br/>
"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" on Deck which force-enables DXR if it is supported, even on Deck.<br/>
New semantics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">dxr</code>: Force-enable DXR, even when it is considered unsafe</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">nodxr</code>: Disable DXR</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">dxr11</code>: Removed. <code class="inline-code">dxr</code> already implied DXR 1.1 anyway</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sampler feedback</h5>
<p>This feature was the last feature required for FL 12.2 and is implemented through emulation.<br/>
As demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/docs/sampler_feedback.md" target="_blank">implementation docs</a>, all<br/>
native implementations of this feature are fundamentally broken in some way.<br/>
There's also no known game that ships requiring this feature, so we just consider this a checkbox feature.</p>
<h5>DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) now exposed by default</h5>
<p>On RDNA2+ and Turing+ we can finally expose the DX Ultimate feature set!</p>
<h5>Misc</h5>
<ul>
<li>Implement a bunch of missing "Vulkan-on-D3D12" features

reordering and batching command preprocessing
<ul>
<li>We have observed 15% FPS gains in Halo Infinite on RADV</li>
<li>1-2% in Starfield in some test locations</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Tune memory allocation patterns for DGC preprocess buffers
<ul>
<li>Avoids a lot of allocation churn</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more bullet hell goodness for your Linux PC or Steam Deck? Good news, Cosmic Carnage looks pretty wild and it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>No, I'm not talking about the fighting game Cosmic Carnage from 1994 but a space shooter filled with action and glorious upgrades from developer LionSword Studios. Looks like they've learned a lot from their 2016 game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/366010/Generic_Space_Shooter/" target="_blank">Generic Space Shooter</a> because this looks far more interesting. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="abfbWyCVlzM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f44d7c48a6f62f3136875790a4e36c1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/abfbWyCVlzM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle endless waves of alien spaceships. Fight against a variety of enemies with different behaviours and attack patterns</li>
<li>Collect EXP to level up and upgrade your ship to help you survive the onslaught. 80+ upgrades available making each run unique and interesting</li>
<li>With a roguelite progression system, no run is ever a fail. Gather more points and unlock new upgrades and weapons to add to the pool to create overpowered builds!</li>
<li>Upgrade your build by unlocking new astronauts and ships. Each astronaut has unique abilities and stats. Each ship has a unique weapon and stats. Synchronize astronauts and ships to unlock hidden synergies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440650/Cosmic_Carnage/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> and with Native Linux support the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2440650/discussions/0/7342618062800321868/" target="_blank">developer said</a> it's "100% compatible with the steam deck". No current set release date while they're still working on it but they have been regularly updating the demo so be sure to check it out. Looks like they may also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2704660/Cosmic_Carnage_Prologue/" target="_blank">Prologue</a> coming as well.</p>

      <title>Explore secrets in a sacred operating system in Crossroad OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's something wrong with this operating system. Crossroad OS is a single-player adventure where you solve puzzles, meet strange creatures and explore a sacred operating system created as a junction between the human and spirit world.</p>
<p>According to the developer it's a bit of a weird mixture between a puzzle and a horror game and that "Crossʀoad OS was created with noble intentions, however approaching the spirits without a stable mind is a risky undertaking. What secrets are hiding in the system's partitions?". Don't go expecting any jump-scares though it's more about the spooky and unsettling atmosphere. Looks like a rather odd one but it has me curious to see more from it.</p>
<p>Check out the initial teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_NAwAIi5l9A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6884bbcf5dd851439f7986b7abd99551.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_NAwAIi5l9A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783800/Crossroad_OS/" target="_blank">Steam </a>and it releases December 8th.</p>

      <title>Please save me I have discovered Leaf Blower Revolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's cold and blowy outside, there's leaves everywhere and so the obvious solution to keep warm is to stay inside and play a game about blowing away leaves. Apparently that's what I'm doing with my life now, playing a free to play Steam game where I throw my mouse around the screen like a maniac to get all these damn leaves off my lawn.</p>
<p>Leaf Blower Revolution is a peculiar game. Released back in 2020 it's gone onto be rather popular too, with over 20,000 user reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating. Clearly they're onto something, and I can see why. I want to keep going and I don't exactly know why.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421276971700834197gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421276971700834197gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's very much a game of watching numbers go up, or not, just leaf it alone and come back later and see what's happened. Since it's an idle game, you can just leave it on a second monitor or in the background, to dive in for a few minutes to take an active role whenever you want.</p>
<p>The game trickles in little treats for you too. There's many different types of leaves to blow away you'll find drop onto your lawn, and as you blow them away you'll get a leaf currency to go and buy some special tools. I must admit, the game gave me a chuckle the first time I closed and opened it, <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2674673571700831763gol1.jpg" target="_blank">noting how</a> I shouldn't be rewarded for doing nothing but it did so anyway and gave me a ton of basic leaves to go and buy stuff with. Okay Leaf Blower Revolution, I see what you're doing, you're trying to get me to play more.</p>
<p>When you start playing more, and buying more (with the in-game currency), it only gets bigger and funnier too. Starting off with nothing but your hands, moving onto rakes and leaf blowers, automatic leaf blowers that travel around the screen like little robots and more. You can even buy nuclear fuel to power-up your devices, what could possibly go wrong there?</p>
<p>After you accrue enough leaves you can buy the ability to get different leaves, which then opens up other types of shops to buy more different quirky tools and abilities. Each shop gives you the ability to buy the next level leaf too and — repeat. Glorious number-go-up repetition while leaves fly around the screen. It's weirdly therapeutic. There's over 30 different leaves, over 38 different shops, over 40 areas, there's even some pets you can get.</p>
<p>The Steam reviews make me laugh too, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sockman21/recommended/1468260/" target="_blank">someone</a> with over 1,000 hours in it wrote "Still need just another hour or two to see if I really like it....", and yeah — that about sums this game up I think. Apparently at some point my Tea went cold, I'll warm it up later, gotta blow away some more leaves.</p>
<p>Unless you want it to take over your life don't download Leaf Blower Revolution.</p>
<p>Works great on desktop Linux with Proton 8, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable. Worked fine on Steam Deck with my testing but the font can be a little small. You can turn up the font size, but the font itself is not very clear but thankfully you can choose an alternative font too which is much clearer.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468260/Leaf_Blower_Revolution__Idle_Game/" target="_blank">free to play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hell Let Loose now works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one I managed to somehow miss recently, but it seems that Hell Let Loose has hooked up Easy Anti-Cheat to work on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Not a big surprise though, considering they clearly stated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hell-let-loose-planning-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">it was in their roadmap</a>, but it appears the addition came without any proper announcement I can find. Seems it was added around a 1-2 months ago. You just need to ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library, and then it should work with Proton 8.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3818444321700829459gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3818444321700829459gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take to the battlefield in this squad-based, 50v50 multiplayer game, and choose one of our 14 roles available within the Command, Infantry, Recon and Armour unit types. Play as an Officer, Spotter, Medic, Tank Commander and more, to experience every aspect of World War II combat. Each role is equipped with different historical weapons, vehicles, and equipment that are intricately detailed, bringing the realism to the brutal and bloody warfare. Unit focussed gameplay is crucial and when done well can command the tide of battle.</p>

      <title>Deckmate, my favourite Steam Deck accessory is discounted for Black Friday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Your Steam Deck deserves a Deckmate. It's easily one of my most used and favourite accessories to pair up with a Steam Deck and now it's discounted so go grab it. They've actually done a bit of a rebrand recently, since they now offer up similar accessories for the ROG Ally too, so they're now known as <a href="https://getmechanism.com/" target="_blank">Mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen it before: it's an attachment system giving you a mounting system to basically mount…well, anything to it. Valve even used it for their video of the Steam Deck OLED orb in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vTsZMvjJ-A" target="_blank">official trailer</a>, all those OLED's were mounted with the Deckmate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11197497451700828392gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11197497451700828392gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It simply hooked over the top and bottom, and the mount itself is thin enough that it really doesn't get in the way of anything. Then you just hook whatever you want into the back of it. That could be a battery pack, a stand, a USB-C hub, attach it to a wall (because why not?) or whatever else you can think of that might need to be attached to it.</p>
<p>For Black Friday there's discount on the <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/deck-mate-entire-system" target="_blank">full system</a>, the <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/the-essentials-bundle" target="_blank">essentials bundle</a>, just as a <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/kickstand-bundle" target="_blank">kickstand</a> and <a href="https://getmechanism.com/" target="_blank">more</a>. The discounts last until Tuesday 28th November.</p>
<p>You can see my quick-take year-old video on it below:</p>

      <title>Check out Doom Infinite, a Doom-based FPS roguelike mod for GZDoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tired of GZDoom mods for DOOM II just adding some maps or some gore? Be sure to take a look at Doom Infinite, which turns it into a FPS roguelike. I've been testing it out myself since it was emailed in (thanks Tate), and love the idea of it! Currently not finished and what you get is only a demo of things to come, as they continue working on it but it's really promising if you love your retro shooters with a bit of extra spice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4379728911700747267gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4379728911700747267gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Encounter demons empowered with various traits and curses that make them stronger, faster or much more tricky to send back to hell. Collect, mix and match multiple permanent power-ups for a unique approach on each runs. Find unique weapons variations or mod them yourself to your liking. Explore more to unlock new places or discover hidden secrets, but beware of the traps and challenges lingering about. All that while the dynamic weather or map-wide curses provide additional challenges. Even the maps themselves can warp and distort, presenting a slightly different path each time you visit them. But more importantly than that - survive the longest you can, while shooting anything moving that crosses your path!</p>
<p>Greatly expanding upon the originals' mechanics, Infinite allows for a fun, dynamic and unique experience along with perma-death and unlockable achievements. From dynamic spawners, balanced game director, visual and audio updates, three brand new weapons, music shuffler to even a simple but expressive emote system - those are only some of the extra components built into this mod, all to enhance ripping and tearing through hordes of demons hunting you down."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-infinite" target="_blank">find it on Mod DB</a>.</p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need a copy of <a href="https://zdoom.org/" target="_blank">GZDoom</a> installed, along with the wad file from DOOM II (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). You'll need to make sure your DOOM II wad file is in the correct location which for standard installs will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And for Flathub installs it will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And then place the Doom Infinite pk3 file into the same folder.</p>
<p>Then to run you via terminal with a standard install:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -file ~/.config/gzdoom/DOOM_Infinite_DEMO_0978_6.pk3</code></p>
<p>And again for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM_Infinite_DEMO_0978_6.pk3</code></p>

      <title>Dominatrix is a fresh updated port of Ritual Entertainment&#39;s SiN</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember SiN? The classic shooter from Ritual Entertainment released in 1998? Well there's a new updated port of it for modern systems. Developer Rohit emailed about it to mention the release on <a href="https://rohit.itch.io/dominatrix" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and their <a href="https://cohost.org/rohit/post/3207148-release-dominatrix" target="_blank">CoHost blog</a> about the work involved that's worth a read.</p>
<p>The thing is, Night Dive Studios did put out SiN: Gold, and they're working on SiN Reloaded but there's no hint at a release date for that yet. Rohit mentions that "While SiN Gold is a pretty decent way to play the game, it still has a few pain points that could really use some smoothing over" and so they put on their coding socks and made Dominatrix.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16811670421700743302gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16811670421700743302gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Linux port.</li>
<li>Better resolution support.</li>
<li>Controller Support.</li>
<li>Weapon radial menu.</li>
<li>Gamepad-friendly virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>Better menu/interface scaling.</li>

<p>It's also been added to the Luxtorpeda, to enable you to easily run it from Steam. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">more on Luxtorpeda here</a>.</p>
<p>You do need the original data files to play it which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sin_gold" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313/SiN_Gold/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown anti-cheat now fixed for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being left broken for about a week, Crytek have now fixed up their Easy Anti-Cheat for Hunt: Showdown to work on Steam Deck / Linux again.</p>
<p>Reported on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/hunt-showdown-is-broken-on-steam-deck-linux-due-to-easy-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">here a few days ago</a>, Hunt: Showdown would boot you out of games showing a warning that Easy Anti-Cheat authorization failed. Crytek did respond and noted in the article that they were working on it, which is good and great to see it fixed. You shouldn't need to do anything, as the issue was on their end, just make sure the game is up to date in your Steam Downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823097551700740270gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823097551700740270gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a shame this sort of anti-cheat issue is still happening though, as we're only a few months away from two years since the Steam Deck released. At least they enabled the support though, plenty of developers still <em>haven't</em> enabled support for Steam Deck / Linux at all like Rust, Destiny 2, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege and many others.</p>

      <title>Diablo IV free to play on Steam until Tuesday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a chance for you to see if you actually want to buy Diablo IV. Not only is it 40% off on Steam and works great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton but it's also <em>temporarily</em> free to play.</p>
<p>Blizzard has made it free until Tuesday, 6PM UTC — so you've got quite a while to jump in and see what to expect from it. Once the free time is over though, you will lose access if you don't purchase it. And thanks to it being on Steam, for Steam Deck / Linux there's no special configuration needed and no messing around with manually installing Battle Net.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2944295031700739740gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2944295031700739740gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Something to note though, which Blizzard don't state on Steam, is that this free to play time only lasts until you hit level 20 in the game. Still a good few hours of gameplay though to give it a run.</p>
<p>With it being 40% off you can pick it up for £35.99 / $41.99 / €41.99.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Have you been playing it? What's your current thoughts on it?</p>
<p>You can see a previous Steam Deck video I did for Diablo IV below, although this was through Battle Net the performance is generally the same:</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.7 released, plus Steam Deck Client update and Power LED changes coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three bits of Steam Deck news for you this morning with multiple updates coming in including a SteamOS update, a Steam Deck Client update and info about some LED changes coming.</p>
<p>Firstly, SteamOS 3.5.7 has been promoted to Stable with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870342884095376976" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed internal microphone not working in certain cases like desktop applications.</li>
<li>Deployed a temporary workaround for a performance problem with "Allow Tearing".</li>
<li>Fixed some USB connectivity issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that a Stable Steam Deck Client Update was also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870342884094741095" target="_blank">released</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed SteamDeck being recognized as previously authorized device for Family Sharing.</li>
<li>Fixed the new controller support panel showing on tools/applications.</li>
<li>Fixed several layout regressions in the quick access menu, eula dialogs, and game achievements page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the buttons back to the game launch interstitials rather than relying on the footer buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the desktop configuration page being blank when opted-out of Steam Input</li>
<li>Fix for Steam Controller gyro turn rate, and sped up gravity correction. Both were affecting the feel of Gyro to Deflection Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some controllers not being able to pass the Stationary Tolerances manual calibration phase.</li>
<li>Fixed occasional "jerks" in "Gyro To..." conversion modes that used the gravity axis (i.e. Player Space, World Space, Laser Pointer modes)</li>
<li>Improved Gyro to Joystick Deflection mode's low level noise.</li>
<li>Reinstated horizontal haptics for all new "Gyro To..." modes.</li>
<li>Fixed UI: order of Steam Deck Gyro's Calibration readings.</li>
<li>Attempt to fix legacy Gyro "Joystick" mode - use the gravity orientation found upon app switch and subtract it from the live feed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the Power LED, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1727479354840822067" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (Twitter): "We're working on an update to let users control the intensity of their power LED, which should be interesting to *LE users." — so it will be interesting to see what they have cooking there. Would be quite nice on the OLED, since it turns bright green when charged which was a bit bright in my bedroom. <em>*By LE, Griffais most likely means the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeck_2023LE" target="_blank">Limited Edition</a>, as it has a translucent shell.</em></p>
<p>Great to see Valve continuing the quick improvements and listening to all feedback there.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-25 released, should fix a bunch of early 2000s games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A small hotfix release of GE-Proton went up with GE-Proton 8-25 containing two changes, but for players of classic games it might be a good release to try.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-25" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Add mpegvideo codec to ffmpeg, should complete Crimson Skies, Azumanga Fighter and possibly a lot of other early 2000s games. (thanks loathingKernel)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's a text guide on how to install GE-Proton.</p>

<ul>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>KDE Plasma</u> - Open the Discover store, in the search box (top left) type in "ProtonUp-Qt", click it and hit Install (top right).

<li><u>Manual install</u> / <u>GNOME</u> - head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On GNOME desktops, you can also download via GNOME Software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using ProtonUp-Qt:</strong></p>
<ul>

      <title>Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Will Never Die! point and click adventure gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die!, a musical comedy point and click adventure game recently added full Native Linux support. Looks like quite a fun one too if you like your rock music and classic adventure games like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="--rKONUxDuM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21dc329096a06d78770cde2455f86dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/--rKONUxDuM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it: "Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! is a parodic adventure inspired by classic point-and-click games, heavy metal, and underground comics. You'll jump into the beer-soaked denim vest of a middle-aged teddy bear to orchestrate the comeback of your old glam metal band, not caring that glam metal has been the laughing stock of everyone in the music industry since the 1980s. A true heavy metal heart never stops beating!</p>
<p>Almost four years in development, Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! offers about ten hours of wild adventures all over the rockosphere with hand-drawn graphics and a bunch of original music."</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://bestgames.itch.io/rock-n-roll-will-never-die" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. Hopefully eventually the Linux version will also come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1644080/Rock_n_Roll_Will_Never_Die/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Positive rating on Steam but not many reviews overall.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 545.29.06 Linux driver released with Source 2 game fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/216530/en-uk/" target="_blank">545.29.06</a> Linux stable driver. A small one with only a few useful sounding fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented setting backlight brightness levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to UI corruption in nvidia-installer on systems with more than one initramfs file per kernel.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hang when running under Xwayland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also a good time for a reminder, especially as it seems other sites did not report on this, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/nvidia-driver-5452902-out-for-linux-plus-other-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">NVIDIA did a security bulletin back in late October</a> and so you'll want to ensure you are up to date to prevent any issues. At a minimum you'll want to ensure you're on one of these drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>545.29.02</li>
<li>535.129.03</li>
<li>525.147.05</li>
<li>470.223.02</li>

      <title>GameMaker now free for non-commercial use, one-time fee for indie devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like GameMaker are trying to eat some of Unity's lunch here after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">mess</a> that was Unity's install fee plan, GameMaker have made it much easier for developers to use it (and cheaper).</p>
<p>Firstly, for non-commercial use, GameMaker is now free to use. So for game devs just starting out, this could be an interesting choice again. And then when you plan to sell your games, the Professional license (doesn't include console) is now a one-time fee instead of a subscription. Much, <em>much</em> better. Simpler and clearer and will no doubt pull in some more developers.</p>
<p>All three of their licenses (Free, Professional, Enterprise) also note this very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revenue Share</strong>: there is no revenue share that you will be required to pay as part of this license.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cost per Install</strong>: there is no cost associated with the number of instals that your content can have.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Additional Costs</strong>: there are no additional costs associated with this license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Professional license also notes it's perpetual, so no worries on them dumping new terms onto you like Unity attempted to do.</p>
<p>On top of that they've also made all their <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/bundles" target="_blank">asset bundles</a> free.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gamemaker-free-platforms" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beat Hazard 3 from Cold Beam Games received an update recently as the developer is hoping to get Steam Deck Verified so they've made some more improvements.</p>
<p>What is it? "Are you ready to explore your music collection mapped as a stunning galaxy of wonders? Experience your music collection as never before with this intense music driven twin stick shooter. Each of your songs will have its own unique ebb and flow based on the music. "</p>
<p>In the recent update the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1493520/announcements/detail/3836565344301599576" target="_blank">announced</a> some changes for Steam Deck support including:</p>

      <title>Riders Republic should now run on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news for fans of crazy sporty games like Riders Republic, as Ubisoft actually worked to get it working on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2290180/announcements/detail/3810669011448242938" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Steam they said: "As some of you may have noticed, some work has been going on behind the scenes to get Riders Republic running on Steam Deck. And we're happy to announce that you can now play the game on this platform!".</p>
<p>The game uses BattlEye, as it's a big multiplayer playground, and since BattlEye does work on Linux they've now gotten it enabled. You just need to ensure you have the BattlEye Runtime installed in your Steam Library. They also said they will continue to work on improving the "flow and playability of Riders Republic, but we're happy that you can now enjoy the game on the go".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2yzzA_nZHtk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bca408aff17d9fe6702501688dbd4c53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2yzzA_nZHtk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's still labelled as Unsupported by Valve for Steam Deck but that's an old rating, so Valve will need to re-check it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290180/Riders_Republic/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Invincible gets updated to fix it with the latest Steam Deck updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Invincible is a story-driven adventure set in a hard sci-fi world by Stanisław Lem. Quite popular and it broke recently with the latest Steam Deck / SteamOS upgrade.</p>
<p>In this case, thankfully, the developer was quick to provide support and they actually patched the game directly to get it working. Now this is what I love to see - proper direct support. The developer mentioned in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/731040/announcements/detail/5872192466327821927" target="_blank">announcement</a> the fix came thanks to people sending over save files so they could identify the problem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uvNGTLPAIPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80688cf3043c110ba75e04f302851a81.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uvNGTLPAIPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Invincible is a first-person game based on the motifs of The Invincible - an iconic novel of the world-known, hard science-fiction author and Polish futurologist Stanisław Lem.<br/>
<br/>
There are places like Regis III, not prepared for us and for which we are not prepared for. Still, our spacecraft inevitably comes closer to the destination - for our stories and fates to cross in a dead spot.</p>
<p>You are a highly qualified, sharp-witted astrobiologist named Yasna. Being entangled in a space race, you and your crew end up on the unexplored planet Regis III. The scientific journey quickly turns into a search mission for lost crewmates. Follow its trail, but be fully aware that every decision you make can bring you closer to danger.</p>

      <title>Valve gives Steam a nice upgrade for controller-friendly games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently tweaking Steam Input and the Steam Client, Valve has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3823053915988527062" target="_blank">upgraded</a> the main Steam Store to show off controller support for games.</p>
<p>They've updated the main <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/controller/" target="_blank">Controller-Friendly Game Hub</a>, allowing you to filter specifically by controller type between Xbox and PlayStation DualShock and DualSense. Making it easier than ever to ensure you're finding games that support your main controller. Example below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15192256231700569569gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15192256231700569569gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Store pages for individual games also had their controller support status expanded. Down the right-side of pages were features are listed, you'll now see bits like this to indicate what controllers they work with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15494809321700569896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15494809321700569896gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's more too including new search filtering options for specific controller models, Steam Library updates to show controller support more clearly and new filtering for your Steam Library (including for Big Picture Mode).</p>
<p>Speaking about why they're now expanding all this they said there were "over 3 Billion game sessions that included a controller in the past year" and of that 60% were with an Xbox controller, 27% PlayStation and the rest a mixture of Steam Deck, Switch Pro, and hundreds of other controller models. Four years ago that controller gaming session count was only 990 million, so it's a huge increase in people gaming with controllers and back then only 19% were using PlayStation controllers so their popularity has increased a lot too.</p>
<p>What do you prefer to game with?</p>

      <title>Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 &#39;TR1X&#39; gets Linux builds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play a classic with a fresh open source game engine? TR1X for Tomb Raider 1 from 1996 has a new release out with a Native Linux version now available. Available under the GPL license, TR1X was made by reverse engineering the TombATI / GLRage variant of the original game and replacing proprietary audio/video libraries with open source variants.</p>
<p>The 3.0 release went up a few weeks ago, followed by two bug fix releases over the last 2 weeks which included the renaming from Tomb1Main to TR1X, adds a developer console, adds Linux builds and toolchain, an option to allow Lara to roll underwater, an option to turn off Eidos logo entirely through config, the bonus level type for custom levels that unlocks if all main game secrets are found, detection for animation commands to play SFX on land, water or both and more features and plenty of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2752794051700567727gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2752794051700567727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>TR1X includes masses of improvements over the original game like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper UI and bar scaling.</li>
<li>Enemy health bars.</li>
<li>PS1 style UI.</li>
<li>Fade effects to displayed images.</li>
<li>Improved support for windowed mode.</li>
<li>Ability to set user-defined FOV.</li>
<li>Ability to look up and down while hanging.</li>
<li>Ability to forward and backward jump while looking.</li>
<li>Ability to look around while running.</li>
<li>A pause screen.</li>
<li>+ the list goes on and on, making it much more modern feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TR1X" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You do need assets from the original game which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/224960/Tomb_Raider_I_1996/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Vulkan drivers on Linux should run more games with Mesa 24.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While work is ongoing to provide brand new Intel Xe Vulkan drivers on Linux with their newer driver, work is still happening to improve the current driver.</p>
<p>Merged recently is support for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25512" target="_blank">Sparse Binding</a> on the i915 driver, which is required by <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">vkd3d-proton</a> to support Direct3D 12 features to run plenty of modern games including (according to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/5003" target="_blank">this feature request</a>) the likes of DEATHLOOP, DIRT 5, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Forza Horizon 4 and 5 and no doubt plenty more.</p>
<p>So when Mesa 24.0 releases, users of Intel GPUs should hopefully get a much better gaming experience with the i915 driver able to run many more games with Proton. Mesa 24.0 isn't due until early 2024, with Mesa 23.3 due this month.</p>
<p>Eventually too when the newer Xe driver (more on that <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/rfc/xe.html" target="_blank">here</a>) is fully upstreamed, Intel GPU gaming on Linux might be even better with a properly modern system.</p>

      <title>Open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK hits Vulkan 1.0 conformance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big step for the in-development open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK, as Collabora have announced how it's hit Vulkan 1.0 conformance. <em>Side-note: This is not coming from NVIDIA directly but people working on Mesa drivers.</em></p>
<p>What does this mean? As explained by developer Faith Ekstrand on the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-reaches-vulkan-conformance.html" target="_blank">blog</a>: "Practically, it means that we can pass the entire Vulkan conformance test suite. From the Khronos perspective, it means that NVK now meets the bar required to claim to support the Vulkan API officially. (There are some legal implications to this which matter to the Mesa project, but most users don't care about them.) From the perspective of users, it means the driver should pretty much work on Turing and later GPUs. There will still be bugs, of course, but those bugs are likely to be app-specific. Most stuff should just work."</p>
<p>This is after <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24998" target="_blank">merging</a> in their new back-end compiler which was required but there's still a lot of work ahead. As Ekstrand goes on to explain heading into 2024 they're actually not far off being able to advertise Vulkan 1.3 but they need to do plenty of compiler work to get there. Plus there's others working on getting Maxwell GPUs supported and once the compiler is a little more "feature-complete" they can then start "taking deep dives into apps, working on app-specific bug fixing as well as performance improvements".</p>
<p>Still experimental but it seems like open source NVIDIA drivers will get quite exciting through next year.</p>

      <title>Portal: Revolution is an upcoming fully-featured Portal 2 prequel mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is exciting! Modders sure do some amazing stuff with Valve games. Portal: Revolution releasing 5th January, 2024 is a new story with original characters, acting as a full gameplay prequel to Portal 2.</p>
<p>You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.</p>
<p>Set in the dead and decaying Aperture facility the developers say it will present you with over 40 new puzzles, and they will use mechanics "not seen in Portal 2". How difficult will it be? They say "Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops" but the new mechanics will be taught as you go along like any good puzzle game does. You can expect somewhere around 5-7 hours playtime.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cXczxIIvXJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc22ee41837af784c9560db29b9d810f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cXczxIIvXJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How was it made? They said it's using a "modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software" which has allowed them to expand it and provide mechanics and various game engine improvements that weren't possible in the original Portal 2.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Zarathustra uses AI Art and AI Voices </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is sure to be an interesting one and will no doubt spark up some comments - Zarathustra is an in-development point and click adventure that looks intriguing but the way it's made will raise some eyebrows.</p>
<p>I have to admit…it <em>does</em> look pretty good <em>but</em> it's made with AI tools. Which in many ways, opens a big can of worms. Not just AI giving a <em>bit</em> of a hand, but a <em>lot</em> of it was done thanks to AI. The developer, Tim Rachor, doesn't hide it either and states it clearly on the itch.io page that "Most of the Art was created with Dall E 3 and the voice over comes from <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank">https://elevenlabs.io/</a>".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="emRBKiafJyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d01dc1a555bbd47b2c9b643235913364.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/emRBKiafJyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said only the first day in-game is available, and they will continue it if people show interest for them to carry it on. They say it's a "rather casual experience with no dead-ends or overly difficult puzzles".</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://tim-rachor.itch.io/zarathustra" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think to this one?</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown is broken on Steam Deck / Linux due to Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 20/11/23 14:33 UTC</strong> — Crytek responded to note: "This is a known issue and we are working on it to fix it and apply the fix for the resolution as soon as possible."</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article text below:</em></p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown, a popular multiplayer game has been broken on Steam Deck / desktop Linux due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>It seems an update released on November 16th just causes players to get kicked from the game. A similar issue to what happened <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/over-a-week-later-apex-legends-is-still-broken-on-linux-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with Apex Legends recently</a>. I've yet to see Crytek comment on this, so I have reached out today see if they're aware and if it will be fixed. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable so either they need to fix it, or Valve will need to change the rating over to Unsupported.</p>
<p>Trying it myself today and it's clearly broken (screenshot from Steam Deck):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18365912251700484668gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18365912251700484668gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully given the popularity of the Steam Deck, and with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" target="_blank">new Steam Deck OLED</a> release, more developers will actually test instead of just pushing out updates like this that break it.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.10 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters of the fheroes2 project and Heroes of Might and Magic 2 players! After a month of tedious work, we are presenting a new version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.10" target="_blank"><strong>1.0.10</strong></a>. As always today's release is full of compelling features and code changes.<br/>
<br/>
The editor being the highest priority at the moment is evolving. Our team added an <strong>enhanced erase tool</strong>, the ability to put artifacts and treasures on the adventure map and also did important groundwork towards expanding the game with new future heroes. The current state of the editor is still not ready to be open to the public, but this is planned to be changed in the very near future.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4793549741700481834gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4793549741700481834gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>We made a lot of changes in relation to rendering and the overall UI of the engine in this release. A lot of small rendering issues were fixed, several dialogs were reworked and we were able to speed up graphics-related code as well. Speaking of UI, the team added a <strong>new hero action icon</strong> to separate situations, when a hero stands on an action object and when he needs to travel to another place.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12668965191700481849gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12668965191700481849gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, we updated the town portal dialog to make it resizable in relation to game resolution and the number of available towns.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7213133431700481866gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7213133431700481866gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The AI in this release received a huge boost in its logic: now it <strong>can use marketplace</strong> to speed up the castle’s development. Important to note, that the AI does not cheat and uses the same exchange rate as human players. The team improved the AI decision-making logic during battles regarding pathfinding and spell evaluation. This makes AI more competitive on higher difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
As in every release before the team updated multiple language translations and fixed dozens of small UI and logic issues, totaling<strong> </strong>more than 30 issues being closed.<br/>
<br/>
An important update: save files that are created by the engine older than 1.0.5 are not supported anymore. This is done to proceed with the Editor development by removing a lot of "hacks" for old saves. If you have save files older than 1.0.5 and want to play them, use 1.0.9 version to open and save these files. The engine will resave files in 1.0.9 format.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md" target="_blank">Installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>You do also need to grab the data from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update brings Half-Life: Uplink, Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something many guessed was coming, Valve has released the Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update and it's pretty exciting with lots of goodies.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3843320743741606906" target="_blank">announcement</a> it mentions updated graphics settings including lighting fixes and an actual widescreen field of view, Controller and Steam Networking support and Steam Deck support with it now officially Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586694111700245939gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586694111700245939gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Half-Life: Uplink on Linux</em></p>
<p>Not just that though they've added in content from Half-Life: Uplink, four new multiplayer maps, and there's restored content for "the true nostalgia-seekers, including original main menu artwork and some early prototype player models from the alpha builds of the game".</p>
<p>On top of that there's in a documentary to mark the occasion from folks at <a href="https://www.secrettape.video/" target="_blank">Secret Tape</a> (known for their work as NoClip Media):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TbZ3HzvFEto"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ec9367da68d1023a0da84c235fa7e3e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TbZ3HzvFEto" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The older version of Half-Life is now in a Beta branch named "steam_legacy", and they're now considering this the definitive version of Half-Life and the one they will "continue to support going forward". So Half-Life: Source is getting reduced visibility (store page will be hidden) but it will remain available for the Source engine community.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/" target="_blank">free until November 25th on Steam</a> and see the <a href="https://half-life.com/en/halflife25/" target="_blank">special page here</a>.</p>

      <title>Inventory Tetris with roguelike exploration and combat Backpack Hero is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just released out of Early Access is Backpack Hero, an intoxicating mixture of backpack sorting that feels like a Tetris shapes sorting-puzzle game with roguelike turn-based combat and exploration that's a thoroughly odd but terribly fun blend.</p>
<p>A game that became pretty popular thanks to the web-based demo on itch.io. The full release is much expanded with a lot more content and features like the addition of rebuilding a town. Really clever idea too, although not the first to do it, but the setting and the way it handles the items and your growing backpack size is thoroughly charming.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4sOIlao40W8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95496321fac2f216972cc7ca996d0ea8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4sOIlao40W8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with your strategy and create game-breaking solutions.</li>
<li>Collect 800+ distinct items, with ingenious powers and synergies to harness.</li>
<li>Battle with over 100+ enemies. Learn their attack patterns and vanquish your foes.</li>
<li>Dive into the endless dungeons! Start every run with randomly generated levels and discover unpredictable items, unique layouts, events, and challenges.</li>
<li>Explore 5 unique play styles by selecting different heroes.</li>
<li>Play standalone runs or experience the full adventure and meta progression in Story Mode.</li>
<li>Rebuild Haversack Hill and help its inhabitants.</li>
<li>Turn the village into an appealing and efficient hamlet to attract new residents. Buy and sell items, conduct research, and unlock heroes, challenges, and quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. I've been playing it on the Steam Deck and it's an absolute joy. Needing to constantly swap around items with others, and re-position them to get the best placement to have all the items effects stack-up on other items in your backpack — it's a game that mixes puzzling and constant strategy. Really, really great stuff and a total joy to play.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/backpack_hero" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/backpack-hero" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1970580/Backpack_Hero/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>On the surface it sounds awesome and looks really interesting. Then you go look at the Steam page, and see it's "Mostly Negative". The main complaint seems to be the pricing at €19.99 / $19.99 / £16.45 not matching up to what players feel the content is worth.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shake up an AI-controlled robotic world in Soul Tolerance releasing in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio developer of ENCODYA and of the recently released Three Minutes To Eight, has announced the release date of Soul Tolerance as December 11th, 2023. Although, this is only Part 1.</p>
<p>The game, entirely created in voxel-art, is set in a society composed exclusively of robots, and controlled by the Divine Mother, a super AI-deity that rules the planet. The protagonist is Unit-12, a simple robo-detective coming hot off the assembly line, who will manage to twist his code and discover a mystery that will shake the roots of the A.I. controlled world.</p>
<p>They've decided to split it up into parts. From the developer: " We’ve been pretty busy here at Chaosmonger Studio. Just a few weeks ago we released Three Minutes To Eight and now we are announcing a new release! The truth is: Soul Tolerance has been ready for a while now, or, at least, its first chapter. We were thinking of releasing the full story we had in mind all together, but that would have required a few years. So, we decided to split the release into five chapters, each at a very fair price, also because we really feel the urge right now to start telling our story about A.I. and its philosophical implications, in perfect line with the times."</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for something a bit smaller and more bite-sized this weekend? Zipp's Café just released and looks nice and chilled. From developer The Wild Gentlemen who also made Chicken Police - Paint it RED!, and the upcoming Chicken Police: Into the HIVE! that takes place in the same world.</p>
<p>"Zipp H. Murphy is one raccoon that does not eat trash - on the contrary, his palate is one of excellent taste, and it shows since he is the owner, chef, and manager of Zipp’s Cafe, the most popular joint in Clawville.

It doesn’t matter if you are a cop, a criminal, or as is usually the case in Clawville, both; Zipp will always have a hot cup of coffee and a delicious plate of food waiting for you… as long as you have the money to pay for it.

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big day for Steam Deck owners, as SteamOS 3.5 is finally here with lots of big additions. Plus, Valve also released a fresh Steam Client update.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is the update that brings official support for the new Steam Deck OLED, along with adjusting the default colour rendering for the Steam Deck LCD to emulate the sRGB color gamut giving warmer and more vibrant colours. Although you can change this any time in the new display settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18875014431700216826gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18875014431700216826gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You will also now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>HDR settings for external displays.</li>
<li>VRR can be enabled for external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain workloads would exhibit severe CPU performance issues unless SMT was manually disabled.</li>
<li>Auto-mounting of external drives.</li>
<li>Improved Bluetooth connection stability, especially with multiple controllers.</li>
<li>Upgraded graphics drivers with lots of performance and compatibility improvements.</li>
<li>An updated Arch Linux package base.</li>
<li>Upgraded KDE Plasma desktop to 5.27.</li>
<li>+ lots and lots and lots more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full SteamOS 3.5.5 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5484882897552407488" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Client update that pulls in some recent additions from various Beta versions for both Desktop and Steam Deck. This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5484882897551382405" target="_blank">includes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update has been re-released with the following fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed video freeze when streaming games with launchers when using NVIDIA hardware encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow local game content transfers from a plugged-in Steam Deck to other Steam clients on the same LAN.</li>
<li>Fixed setting the correct AppID in Source SDK mod manager.</li>
<li>Visual tweaks to Steam Deck, Big Picture Mode and SteamVR: Many small changes throughout to make the user interface a more visually-rich experience in Home, Library and other areas.</li>
<li>Nicer layout for Soundtracks pages. These pages are now easier to navigate in Big Picture Mode and feature larger artwork on Desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed some layout and interaction bugs in the Media viewer.</li>
<li>Move the controller support information in the desktop client from the play bar to a widget in the right column</li>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
<li>Fix bug preventing you from launching a game that had temporarily disabled auto-updates if new workshop content was available.</li>
<li>Additional information about controller support has been added to the client:
<ul>
<li>Game details pages in the library will now show information about specific controller and VR support in the right-hand column when devices are connected.</li>
<li>PlayStation controllers have a new default mode in Steam Input where Steam will route controllers to the game's built-in support if available and to Steam Input when they would be unsupported. These controllers can still be globally opted-in or out of Steam Input in the controller tab of the Steam settings page.</li>
<li>The landing page of the controller configurator now has controller support information, and it has been made easier to quickly opt in or out of Steam Input for a particular game.</li>
<li>In the Big Picture library there is now Xbox/DualShock/DualSense support tabs similar to the "Great on Deck" tab that are populated based on your connected devices.</li>
<li>DualShock, DualSense, and Steam Input API support have been added to the available filters in the library.</li>
<li>Games that require controllers (no mouse/keyboard support), require a VR Headset, or support both VR and standard game modes will now show that information in the client, similar to how it displayed in the store.</li>
<li>Footer icons for DualSense controllers in Big Picture have been updated to use the black and white style on the device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed hidden mouse cursor when streaming to Android TV.</li>
<li>Fixed stream lockup when using Intel iGPU hardware encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected.</li>
<li>In games that support SteamInput API Actions we no longer hide the Flick Stick as Mouse option if a FlickStick action is defined - this is so that Gyro To Mouse can be properly complemented if you wish.</li>
<li>Fixed the ROG Pugio II mouse showing up as a controller.</li>
<li>Fix: Gyro Joystick mode: Core gyro quaternion is updated even when the app requesting it is not focused.</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick (Deflection) mode uses sensor fusion controller accelerometer rather than quaternion for more consistent behavior. This should address issues where the X output would become canted in the legacy modes. Note: it may feel subtly different. Feedback welcome.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED is just pure joy - the definitive Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck OLED releases officially from Valve today, bringing with it numerous improvements to my favourite Linux-powered gaming handheld and here's my initial thoughts on spending some time with it. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">originally reviewed the LCD Steam Deck back at release</a> since Valve sent over a review unit and they did the same for the Steam Deck OLED.</p>

<p>Plus there's a Limited Edition Steam Deck OLED with different exclusive colours for the 1TB model but that is only available in the USA / Canada and it's in limited quantities. For the release Valve said they are limiting the Steam Deck OLED purchases to one per customer per week, but this will be relaxed when they are confident they can meet the demand.</p>
<p>While it's refresh of the existing Steam Deck, it really is quite a <em>different</em> beast. Looks wise though, it's pretty much the same at first glance with the same shell size apart from the new <em>slightly</em> bigger thumbstick design, and a new coloured power button that's a little higher. The new thumbsticks are <em>much</em> nicer though and more concave than the older design, so they're easier to keep your thumbs actually on them. Funny how even the smallest of tweaks makes the Steam Deck OLED so much nicer to actually play games on directly as it really does make a big difference. Even without using HDR, the Steam Deck OLED screen is just far superior in standard games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/869697361700157296gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/869697361700157296gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Steam Deck 1TB OLED top, 512GB LCD bottom. Look at the colours and the power / battery time. Click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>Looks are very much deceiving overall here though, because once you turn it on and start using it — clearly this is <em>not</em> the Steam Deck I've come to know and love. It's just better. That display is just…gosh, the difference between it and the LCD is completely ridiculous. It's brighter, it's clearer, the colours are better and it's slightly bigger too and with it going up to 90Hz it's pure joy to play with. HDR support is working well, although there's not a whole lot to test with and finding them isn't actually that easy but Valve did just recently add HDR Support notices into the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-353-preview-fixes-lcd-issues-plus-steam-deck-desktop-beta-adds-hdr-info/" target="_blank">previous Steam Beta update</a> and hopefully soon a proper category on the Steam Store to make finding them easier again. From the picture above showing Ori and the Will of the Wisps, with both on max brightness and the OLED with HDR it should be clear enough how much richer the colours are. Not just that, but so much more battery time!</p>
<p>Since it's the same shell, the vast majority of existing accessories will still fit as well, which I did <a href="https://youtu.be/v-tFH1kO-BM" target="_blank">a short demo on in a recent video</a> showing the Deckmate, dbrand Killswitch and the JSAUX Modcase. So you won't have to go out and buy a whole bunch of new kit to go with it, which is really great. Not <em>everything</em> though. Some screen protectors won't fit if they didn't cover the entire screen area including the bezels, and with the thumbsticks tweaked design that's just slightly bigger so most thumbstick covers likely won't fit either (my dbrand thumbstick covers didn't fit properly and easily pop-off).</p>
<p>There's improvements to some of the buttons as well too which is good to see. The Steam and Quick Access Menu buttons that were notoriously spongy and kind-of awful feeling on both my LCD models have been adjusted to give a nice muted click feeling. The Select and Menu buttons at the top of the unit also feel a bit more clicky too. Not an audible click though, just the click-feel.</p>
<p>Cooling is massively improved too. While I don't have thermal equipment and have to rely on touch, it's noticeably cooler where it counts. The biggest improvement is the fan though, something that was an issue on the original LCD model that was split between two different fans. Here, the fan is bigger and quieter than both of my LCD models (one of which has that annoying high-pitch noise). It's more like a gentle blowing sound that you would expect from something pumping out a lot of heat and with the Steam Deck audio turned up even to 50% - I simply can't hear the fan. Absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>Charging speed was something I was keen to test as Valve said they "improved battery chemistry for faster charging, from 20% to 80% in as little as 45 minutes" — so that was put to the test in my own way. Bringing both an OLED and LCD down to 10% charge (where you get the on-screen warning) and then leaving them plugged in while turned on but completely idle, at 50% screen brightness on I saw:</p>
<ul>
<li>512GB LCD to 90%: 2 hours, 11 minutes.</li>
<li>1TB OLED to 90%: 1 hour, 28 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people of course will likely charge while the unit is asleep though, so of course I tested that too. Running the Steam Deck down until it gave the yellow on-screen 10% warning again up to the LED showing full charge:</p>
<ul>
<li>512GB LCD: 2 hours 31 minutes</li>
<li>1TB OLED: 1 hour 33 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's nearly a full hour faster to charge in sleep mode to a full charge. So yes, the OLED really will charge faster despite the bigger battery too thanks to their improvements. This is great news for people in a rush, or for people who keep leaving it on sleep and forgetting to charge it because that is surprisingly quick and I’m really happy with those results, Valve did a great job on the new battery for the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>Actually in-game time though, how’s the battery life there (see my <a href="https://youtu.be/aWa8xNBPuro" target="_blank">latest OLED Q&amp;A video Part 2</a>!)? Testing with 50% brightness, 50% volume I picked Cyberpunk 2077 and DiRT Rally. DiRT Rally actually has a benchmark mode you can infinitely loop, making this a good test. For DiRT Rally on Medium settings at 60FPS the Steam Deck OLED model gave a good 2 hours extra battery life around 5 hours compared to 3 hours on the older Steam Deck LCD. The OLED was also <em>consistently</em> using <em>less</em> power at all the same settings.</p>
<p>How does this translate to other titles though? Testing Cyberpunk 2077, matching up all settings at 30FPS locked using the same save I saw similar results to DiRT Rally with less power being used. Using the Steam Deck graphics preset, it was giving a good solid extra hour battery life. So it went from around 1 hour 30 on the Steam Deck LCD up to 2 hours 30 on the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>From other games I've tested like Elden Ring and various others including plenty of smaller indie games, the battery life is just clearly better. But not just that, there are some differences in the performance I've seen too. Every game so far has been at least a little bit noticeably smoother. Not overly surprising though, given the RAM speed bump from 5500 MT/s to 6400 MT/s, and since I've seen it run cooler and use less power while gaming as well, it's probably not hitting the limits the LCD is allowing the OLED performance to stay up top. It's not drastic though, we're talking a couple FPS and a little bit smoother frame-timing. I'll have more on that in future articles / videos.</p>
<p>For people who enjoy docking their Steam Deck, the Steam Deck OLED's ability to wake from Bluetooth with controllers is another really nice addition. With the release firmware update, I've tested this working with a latest-gen Xbox controller, and with a PlayStation 4 controller. A bit quirky though, as the Deck OLED blips back to life for a second or so on Sleep at times and then fully sleeps. So as always, a few little niggling issues for Valve still to sort but it does work. Now when I want to play docked on my sofa with my 4K TV, I can just flop onto my sofa, gab my controller and jump back into whatever game I told it to go to sleep with.</p>
<p>Since we've seen that Valve constantly upgrade all the software from the Steam Client to SteamOS itself (that they sometimes decide to call Steam Deck OS), we know it's only going to keep getting better for both the LCD and OLED and I can't wait to see what else they have cooking. Plus, with it being more repairable than before due to the internal redesign and new case screws, it's going to have a long healthy life. While I aimed to talk about various bits here, there's plenty of things I've missed and this should <em>not</em> be considered a final review by any means since Valve do change things quite often (and I've had a lot less time with the OLED to review compared with the LCD at release). So be sure to follow the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a> for all the incoming news.</p>
<p>If you were previously considering buying a Steam Deck - I can't see a reason not to just finally go for it. For people who already have a Steam Deck, it's still a very impressive upgrade when taking the sum of all the improvements together from the <em>massively</em> improved screen to the healthy battery life boost.</p>
<p>Overall and simply put: I cannot imagine going back to the LCD model after toying with the Steam Deck OLED. It's better in pretty much every way aside from a big performance bump that we can expect from an eventual Steam Deck 2. It's a thing of beauty and my new constant companion. It may not be a next-generation thing but at this point it's close enough.</p>

      <title>Turn-based animal action-RPG &#39;Of Blades &amp; Tails&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Become Reik, a clever member of the fox tribe in Of Blades &amp; Tails from Felix Laukel and Pineapple Works that has now left Early Access.</p>
<p>Inspired by genre classics such as Tales of Maj'Eyal and Stoneshard, Of Blades &amp; Tails brings on a fresh approach to the turn-based RPG genre by offering the player faster-paced "skill &amp; gear"-oriented gameplay. Players can follow the main story or hunt for treasures in ancient ruins and mysterious dungeons. Character development and gaining powerful equipment plays a major role on the journey.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lP1VSi4npuE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65f9a4969e2611bd3a58a4364a7d7c44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lP1VSi4npuE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Turn-based combat that allows for quick action or strategic planning.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support but there's currently no Steam Deck rating for it. The developer mentioned it works great but needs custom Steam Input configuration due to it lacking full controller support. Players on Steam have given it a Very Positive rating so looks like another quality indie release worth your time!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_blades_and_tails" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1768780/Of_Blades__Tails/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Next on my list to complete once my current run through co-op Terraria is done with, Core Keeper is another wonderful mining sandbox adventure and the 1.0 release has now been set with a new content roadmap to Summer 2024.</p>

<p>Currently on their roadmap they have a Year-End Update coming in December as a minor update, a Lunar Update is February 2024 that will have seasonal content and other minor additions, a Language Update in Spring 2024 as another minor update and then the Summer Update in (you guessed it) Summer 2024 as another minor update before the full 1.0 release but they also teased there's "more to come".</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes controls in Starfield and supports Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh Proton Experimental release for November 15th so here's your run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as newly playable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
<li>Tenioha! feat. Mami.</li>
<li>Killsquad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting that Valve notes Assassin's Creed Mirage as now playable, since it's not currently available on Steam. That hasn't stopped gamers though of course. People have been playing it on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with other methods like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/heroic-games-launcher-2-10-0-released-with-plenty-of-essential-fixes/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/nonsteamlaunchers-adds-support-for-the-minecraft-launcher-and-lots-of-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed swapped start / select buttons on controllers in Starfield and other games using Windows.Gaming.Input.</li>
<li>Fixed triple monitor handling in Project Cars 3 and Project Cars 2.</li>
<li>Fixed load / save dialogs not working in Idle Spiral on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Proton 8 regression fix: games should be able to switch monitors in fullscreen mode on Cinnamon DE again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It will just show up in your Steam Downloads as an update for Proton Experimental, as Proton updates just like games do, so keep an eye out for it. Want more info about Steam Play and Proton? Check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Anima Flux is an upcoming co-op metroidvania with slick cut-scenes and a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to check out another upcoming game? Anima Flux (previously called Lost in Sky: Violent Seed) looks rather awesome if you love action-platformer metroidvania styled games and it has local co-op too.</p>
<p>Currently in development for release late 2024, you take control of two genetically enhanced soldiers. You'll fight your way through swarms of mutants through a desolate, dystopian space city and save humanity's last stronghold.</p>
<p>From what the developers say: "The unusual spin of the genre, turns the classic metroidvania into a fun, couch co-op adventure. Both characters develop differently as the game goes on. Explore the grim locations of the space ark, rescue an ambushed or seriously injured partner. Get challenged by dangerous mutants and build your own boss-fight strategies together with a friend. And the best part is that you can always switch to single player mode if your pal is not around."</p>

<p>Really like the style of this one and with Native Linux support, it should hopefully be a great one at release. Especially like their slick animated cut-scenes that really add to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>You can follow and try the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/763180/Anima_Flux/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and it will also be on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/anima_flux" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi 4x strategy game ZEPHON has a fresh Steam demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the mood to try out an upcoming sci-fi 4x strategy game, look no further than the latest demo for ZEPHON. Arriving next year with Native Linux support, the latest from Proxy Studios (Pandora: First Contact, Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War) is looking pretty great.</p>
<p>The demo was updated late last month, and it's live until November 22nd. Expect bugs and issues since it's an in-development alpha version that is limited to single player against two opponents on a small map. The full version though will have "co-op and pvp multiplayer, larger maps, advanced world generation parameters, 8 leaders, 3 NPC factions, over 50 units spread across 10 tiers of research, more terrain features and quests, an end-game grand finale, unlockable game modifiers, achievements, multiple languages as well as full workshop support".</p>
<p>The biggest changes in this demo are the additions of the ZEPHON NPC faction, 2 new neutral units and 3 new quests.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10495559591700056200gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10495559591700056200gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No specific release date yet other than sometime in 2024.</p>

      <title>Saelig Review - an engaging and unique experience</title>
      <author>Ricky Black</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This review is based on the state of the game in version 42.4. Saelig is early access and still in active development.</em></p>
<p>Have you ever tried looking for an oddly specific game? Or played a game that’s <em>almost</em> the perfect game, but not quite? I’m sure it has happened to many people over the years. In my case, I’d been looking for something like a mix of Banished, The Sims, Medieval Dynasty, and The Guild. I hadn’t had a lot of luck finding it until I ran across Saelig. I would probably describe it as a business management game with a generous dusting of role playing and sandbox elements, all set in the medieval era. To my knowledge this a somewhat niche mix of genres. It most likely isn't for everyone, but if the description sounds intriguing it is definitely worth trying out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19789035841700023761gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19789035841700023761gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Saelig, also stylized SÆLIG, drops you into the shoes of a person in late 9th century England and lets you create your own story. You can spend your days chopping wood in the forest, mining gold or silver, growing various fruits and vegetables, baking bread, fishing, hunting, and much more. If work isn’t something you want to do, feel free to stand outside of the alehouse and beg for coins. You won’t get rich that way, but you’ll stay alive. If the criminal life is calling you, it is possible to pickpocket villagers in the market or even start your own gang to pillage and burn the surrounding countryside. Just make sure you don’t get caught and thrown into the pit to rot! You can join the church and become an abbot, or rise to a powerful position in your community government. Look for a wife or husband, have children to leave your goods to, and pretty much just live your own life. Be warned though, there have been rumors of small groups of raiders known as Vikings landing in the surrounding area. You’ll want to choose where you live carefully, or be prepared to defend yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1400405271700023759gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1400405271700023759gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>It looks quite cold! Best head to the market to buy a coat.</em></p>
<p>There are several different ways to start. Your character can start as anything from a beggar with nothing but a handful of coins to a fairly rich person with a randomly selected business and a house right from the beginning. In the long run you’ll almost always end up wealthy if you try, but the fun is in the journey. I would definitely recommend playing through the tutorial before you begin, it can help a bit with the initial learning curve. Also, don't be afraid to start over after a few hours on your first save. You can view your first character as a trial run, and you should have a fairly good idea of how the game works and what you enjoy doing by that point.</p>
<p>My first character, Sherlyn Traynor, moved into the town of Ashbury (population 49) in the year 880AD. He had just purchased a small house in the center of town, right next to the alehouse. During a tour of the town he decided to purchase the fishing dock at the edge of town. After a few days of fishing and gathering pearls, Sherlyn had decided to hire someone to help out. The next day, Sherlyn noticed someone fishing from the beach a little way from the dock. He learned that the fisherman’s name was Leowahl, and offered him a job. Leowahl accepted and immediately started working. The money began flowing in more quickly, making some improvements possible.</p>
<p>A year or so layer, Sherlyn was standing outside his house as one of the town guard was heading home from work. Her name was Edith, and she and Sherlyn chatted for a few minutes before he went to work. The town had grown since he had moved in, but it was still small enough that you met people on a regular basis. They ran into each other while buying produce at the market and again at church. They began talking regularly, and Sherlyn was soon spending all of his profits on fixing up his house. Not long afterward they were married, and in the coming years they would go on to have four children. Two of them would go to work at a mine that Sherlyn had purchased, and the other two would go on to be woodcutters. Sherlyn still fished quite a bit, but he also began doing a bit of hunting and farming on the side. He and Edith both lived to their elder years before passing on, and Leowahl continued working for them until then.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11895836291700023750gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11895836291700023750gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Skills are improved by using them, so practice is important.</em></p>
<p>It is possible to continue playing as your heir, but that was the point that I decided to start a new character with what I had learned so far. I’ve gone on to play many characters and all of the maps since then. To this point one of my favorite gameplay loops is starting as a farmer, eventually acquiring a flour mill and then a bakehouse. I also enjoy working as a trader, traveling between towns and finding cheap products to hopefully sell at a profit. Hunting can be enjoyable once you get enough archery practice, and can also be fairly profitable. I find that the game is most enjoyable when you’re more focused on the role play rather than profit though, so I enjoy trying new things.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15492070591700023755gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15492070591700023755gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>The game animals available to hunt.</em></p>
<p>In my opinion the developer has done a very good job of creating a living world. People are born and die, have children, get jobs, move to other towns, build buildings, and run businesses all without any player interaction. Buildings require wood to be built, and the in game woodcutters are the only means of producing it. Every person needs a set amount of food to live each day, which they will need to either forage or buy. They will even adopt pets which then follow them around wherever they go! It really sells the fact that your character is just one more person trying to live in the world. Another good example of this is employment. If you don’t want to own a business, you can get a job at most of the establishments in the game. You’ll need to be quick though. The job openings are limited by the number of businesses that have been built, and all of your unemployed neighbors also need jobs!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330284331700023756gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330284331700023756gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>The pets I've found so far. Needs more cats!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are currently 13 unique businesses that you can purchase or build in the game, and most can be upgraded to provide more services or hire more workers. Some of them, like the farm or mine, only need a few laborers to create a salable product. Others, like the bakehouse and workshop, need to have a steady supply of raw materials flowing in from markets and other businesses to produce a profit. By owning all of the buildings in the supply chain you can be sure to have a steady flow of raw materials moving in, as well as a higher profit margin!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The graphics and detail seem pretty good for a game like this. If you spend a lot of time in first person you’ll start noticing some things, like the limited number of face and clothing options available. There are also good things to notice as well! My character will often ride to other towns on a horse cart, and if you ride along in first person you’ll often see nice little touches like empty bottles and various things lying along the roads. Littering has always been a problem!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13499286991700023754gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13499286991700023754gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>One of the many nice scenes you'll find while playing Saelig.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">To somewhat summarize and also add to my ramblings, I've created a list of some of my favorite features:</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- A Native Linux build! It's always great when a developer creates a game with a native port in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Large amount of player freedom. If you want to pick apples and forage produce for a living, it's completely possible. Maybe you prefer travelling between towns as a trader? Also an option!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- NPCs have the same capabilities as your character. Your character doesn't have any extra privileges or advantages other than being controlled by you. If you make your neighbors angry enough, they will most likely toss torches onto the roof of your house or steal items from your businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- The living economy. It's always been immersion breaking for me when I walk into a secluded market and find limitless amounts of certain goods. Here you have to hurry to market as soon as someone brings in wood, because your neighbor also needs wood to build a barn!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Enjoyable maps. I like the nice variety of towns and villages to live in, as well as some plots in the woods to build houses if you’d rather be a hermit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/462051481700023752gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/462051481700023752gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>A shed that caught fire late one evening. Notice the guy to the right? Pretty sure he did it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">So far I've mentioned mostly the good things, but there are a few things that I feel could be improved. As mentioned previously, the developer continues to add new features and fixes, so I expect that some of the things mentioned are designed as placeholders, and updates may be planned for future iterations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Social interactions. There are just a few options for chatting, asking questions, flirting, and angry dialog right now. You can also invite someone to go with you to the alehouse. Even though I know how difficult it is to make a complex dialog tree, I’m hoping we’ll have a few more options once the rest of the game is nailed down.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Character customization. While I'm not normally very focused on the appearance of my characters in games, I do like doing a bit of basic customizing to start. So far there aren’t a lot of options as there are a total of 8 human models in the game. There are 4 male and 4 female, and each one has two preset options for hair color, hair style, and clothing. By extension, more npc faces and clothing options would be nice.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Wiki access on the Linux version. Currently the wiki is only usable on the Windows version. I got around this by pulling the wiki up on a separate monitor, but it's nice to have it in game. If you run the Windows version through Proton it works fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Endgame content. Right now profit starts to snowball once you reach a certain point, so it would be nice to have more options to slow your progress. This is listed on the development roadmap, so it is being worked on.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Some improvements in the UI. While the user interface isn't bad, there were a few things that I ran into with some regularity. It would be a helpful at times to just right click on a building in your owned list and have a go to option for your character or, in the case of your house, a sleep option. Another thing that I bumped up against various times was the amount of time it takes to pan across the map. You can press the tab key to pull back and see the whole map, but you're unable to pick another area to zoom in and view. Both of those things have workarounds, but it's not quite as smooth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1497819161700023767gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1497819161700023767gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>A sample of the user interface.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This section is my personal wishlist of ideas that I would love to see added, but don’t really affect the current playability of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Very large maps or map switching. I'm sure this would cause performance issues, but very large maps would be great. It would give the ability to have individual regions for mining, farming, etc. This would then create a greater need for traders, which then increases the amount of bandits, then mercenaries and guards.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Mod support. This is something that has been asked about before, and the developer has mentioned it as a possible addition once the game is complete. I could see modders jumping on a game like this and giving it almost infinite replayability.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- More playability in first person. I've spent a lot of time walking around in first person mode, unfortunately you can't really do much that way. For instance, you can walk to your favorite foraging patch in first person but need to switch back when interacting with it. I know the game isn't really designed to work that way, but I enjoy spending time in that mode!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Option to lock camera to a character in the birdseye view. It is possible to follow a character right now, but it moves to an over the shoulder view that doesn't allow you to see much else. I sometimes enjoy following characters around and watching what they like to do in games like the Sims, and this would make it easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Although Saelig is still considered early access on Steam, the developer has explained they kept the tag so people realize there are still major components that are being added. They have recently mentioned plans to exit early access within the next few updates, so some of those features may be coming <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/612720/discussions/0/3872591600385745702/" target="_blank">soon</a>. I don't remember running into many bugs while playing the latest version, it’s been an extremely stable experience to this point. The developer seems very open to feedback, and has implemented many features and changes that have been suggested over the years. On the Steam Early Access page they mention involving players as much as they can, and that appears to be happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3416323641700023763gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3416323641700023763gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>It's a very picturesque game.</em></p>
<p>I did run into some minor performance issues while playing, mostly on the Steam Deck. It’s not unplayable by any stretch of the imagination, but worth mentioning.</p>
<p>On my primary computer I limited my FPS to 60 and it stays stable at that except for very minor stutters while zoomed out and panning around. I’m assuming at this point that it’s an optimization issue or a Unity engine issue as none of my components were being pushed. At times the framerate will drop down a few when in first person mode or down at ground level looking around. Other than that it ran well. For reference, the game was reviewed on a Ryzen 9 5900x, 32gb RAM, and a Radeon RX 6800 XT at 3440x1440.</p>
<p>The game runs reasonably well on the Steam Deck overall, even though it doesn't have controller support. It doesn't have a rating from Steam at this point, but I would consider it playable. During normal gameplay there are some noticeable stutters when panning quickly around the map, but otherwise it runs at a fairly stable 40 fps using the very good preset. However, the frame rate drops to 30-35 fps anytime you go into first person mode or look up at the sky or trees. Lowering the graphics preset didn't seem to do a lot to improve it, but it was still playable. It could be a limit of the Unity engine, as my main computer was also getting a lower framerate in the same situation. Battery life was around 1hr 45m on very good. There are no Deck control layouts for the game yet, but I used the keyboard and mouse preset as a base and have been gradually adjusting it to my liking. I also increased the UI size to make things easier as well.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is a great game as it is, and the high likelihood of getting a good bit more content added for free in the future is an added bonus. The dev has been releasing fairly regular updates since 2017, and seems to be willing to keep going. I paid full price for it when I got it, and going by the somewhat flawed $1 per hour value metric I've gotten my money's worth several times over.</p>

      <title>Valve detail their plans to combat Steam Deck OLED scalpers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the release of the Steam Deck OLED and the Steam Deck OLED Limited Edition tomorrow, Valve has given out a little bit more info on how they plan to combat scalpers.</p>
<p>Firstly, there <em>is</em> a Limited Edition model with a smoky translucent shell that's only available for the USA / Canada but the <em>rest</em> of the line of Steam Deck OLED are <em>not</em> limited. The normal 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck OLED models will be available globally where the existing LCD Steam Deck is. I've seen a surprising amount of people confused on this across the net thinking the Steam Deck OLED as a whole is limited but it's not.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the special Limited Edition version Valve has said:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be in the United States or Canada.</li>
<li>Your account needs to be in good standing.</li>
<li>Your account needs to have made a purchase on Steam before November 2023.</li>
<li>Only one unit may be purchased per account.</li>
</ul>
<p>If their experiment with this extra Limited Edition model goes well, we may see others come in future.</p>
<p>Additionally, their FAQ also notes for the <em>normal</em> 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck OLED models you will only be able to purchase "1 model of Steam Deck OLED per customer per week" but they plan to relax that when they're confident they can meet demand.</p>
<p>They <em>will</em> switch to the reservation queue if needed and email people when it's ready but Valve also said "we will be refreshing inventory of Steam Deck regularly, and do not foresee long queue times like we saw with the Steam Deck LCD launch".</p>
<p>All models go live at the same time at 10AM PST / 6PM UTC on November 16th on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck store</a>.</p>

<p>Three pieces of Steam news for you today covering the Steam Deck and desktop Steam as there's been various updates and improvements.</p>
<p>Firstly the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3820802745609827707" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.3 Preview</a> update went out to fix Steam Deck LCD issues from the 3.5.2 update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression with color management sliders.</li>
<li>Fixed a fan control regression.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there's now a HDR Support notice on games in your Steam Library, although you do need to expand the details view to see it (the circled i on desktop / Game Info on Steam Deck and Big Picture). This applies to both the Steam Deck and Desktop Steam clients available in the Beta update channel. HDR is <em>also</em> now available as a filtering option in your Steam Library too for Collections and for generally filtering the Steam Library on Steam Deck / Big Picture Mode.</p>
<p>Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21352869041700047489gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21352869041700047489gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18881286741700047633gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18881286741700047633gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This does depend on developers accurately tagging their games as having HDR Support though of course. There is not currently a HDR category on the Steam store directly so hopefully Valve will add it to make it easier for Steam Deck OLED uses and desktop HDR screen owners.</p>
<p>Steam Deck Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3800535912303901889" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick (Deflection) mode uses sensor fusion controller accelerometer rather than quaternion for more consistent behavior. This should address issues where the X output would become canted in the legacy modes. Note: it may feel subtly different. Feedback welcome.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Desktop Steam Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3780269713976536546" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the controller support information in the desktop client from the play bar to a widget in the right column</li>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
<li>Fix bug preventing you from launching a game that had temporarily disabled auto-updates if new workshop content was available</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>

      <title>Goober Dash is a chaotic 32-player Race Royale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the creators of the rather great <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/rocket-bot-royale-is-like-a-worms-styled-battle-royale-with-jumping-tanks/" target="_blank">Rocket Bot Royale</a>, Winterpixel Games Inc. just announced Goober Dash, a racing royale game of pure chaos. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> again too with a "Custom C++ Backend" and it will release with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It sounds just a <em>little</em> bit like Fall Guys except in 2D and just as ridiculous. The developers say that Goobers have the ability to DASH, which can be used as a speed burst, to smash through obstacles, and even send your opponents <em>flying</em>. There's even a full course creator to build and upload levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KV4GNwqVRGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa33d12f3d01ba82db87898df8275153.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KV4GNwqVRGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced multiplayer platforming.</li>
<li>Up to 32 real players in each race.</li>
<li>Cross-platform play.</li>
<li>Custom Races with friends.</li>
<li>Daily global timed challenges.</li>
<li>Unlockable Customization for your Goober.</li>
<li>Full Course Creator/Editor.</li>
<li>Share your Courses and get them in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>"With Goober Dash, we wanted to continue our tradition of creating fun, competitive, multiplayer games that you can enjoy with friends for years," said Tyron Haugen, Creative Director at Winterpixel Games. "For this game, we knew we wanted to give our community the tools to make this world their own, and with the Course Creator, we've allowed players to create whatever they can imagine, and then experience it with their friends. Honestly, we've been blown away by what the community has come up with so far."</p>
<p>Sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun</p>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2661160/Goober_Dash/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> or play via the <a href="https://gooberdash.winterpixel.io/" target="_blank">browser</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 goes Wayland by default, initial HDR gaming support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another update on the progress of the upcoming KDE Plasma 6 desktop environment release, there's some fun details from Nate Graham. <em>FYI: KDE Plasma is used on the Steam Deck for the Desktop Mode!</em></p>
<p>From Graham's usual weekly progress <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/11/10/this-week-in-kde-wayland-by-default-de-framed-breeze-hdr-games-rectangle-screen-recording/" target="_blank">blog post</a> it's noted that Plasma 6 has now set Wayland as the default. As developer Neal Gompa noted in the accepted <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/2188" target="_blank">merge request</a>, "The KDE Plasma experience with Wayland has reached a level of maturity where it makes sense to switch it to the default session."</p>
<p>Another big one is the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/4589" target="_blank">merging</a> of initial HDR support for gaming (which I previously reported on), that has also now been accepted, using a cut-down version of the upstream protocol that isn't yet finished so that the Plasma team can let people test and play with the HDR implementation for gaming.</p>
<p>One change I'm happy to see is the removal of the need to approve or deny "background activity" of Flatpak apps, it was a bit of a nuisance as Graham said "the whole concept of this has been removed as it was kinda sus and not useful at all".</p>
<p>Plenty of theme improvements for Breeze too as they gave it a bit of an overhaul to have "no more frames within frames" so that instead "Breeze-themed apps adopt the clean design of modern Kirigami apps, with views separated from one another with single-pixel lines".</p>
<p>Plasma start-up time was also improved by multiple seconds.</p>
<p>This is the current roadmap as a reminder as the first big <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/kde-plasma-6-gets-a-first-alpha-release/" target="_blank">Plasma 6 Alpha is out now</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>

      <title>METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version now shouldn&#39;t lose your saves</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the big nuisances of the METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version release on Steam, was that you may have found your saved games vanished. The latest version should fix that happening going forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol1-is-quite-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Noted in my initial article and video</a> about the release on Steam, if you saved and then just quit the game without first using the L1+R1 (gamepad shoulder buttons) overlay menu, it seemed like the save you made would just…vanish. A pretty <em>incredible</em> bug to release with and numerous gamers noted their lost progress due to this. Thankfully, it should be solved now.</p>
<p>The latest patch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131630/view/3817424410883454487" target="_blank">version 1.3.0</a> notes these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added save functionality improvements.</li>
<li>Updated the Online Manual.</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus they're currently investigating this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An issue which sometimes causes certain cutscenes to stop playing.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve has given it a Steam Deck Playable rating, mainly due to some small text. It's also rated Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2131630?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for desktop gamers.</p>
<hr/>
<p>METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version was also updated to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131650/view/3826431610132960581" target="_blank">version 1.3.0</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where some buttons were assigned multiple functions (Details on the updated controls are available in the Online Manual).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the audio was out of sync with certain videos.</li>
<li>Updated the Online Manual.</li>
<li>Removed the "Download" section from the game launcher (Check <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131650/view/3736358345125342519?snr=1_2108_9__2107" target="_blank">here</a> for our guide on how to install/uninstall the DLCs).</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And they're investigating this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An issue where some face paints are displayed in a lower resolution.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>KeeperFX open-source remake and expansion of Dungeon Keeper 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it (sadly) doesn't yet have proper Native Linux support, it's still great to see more open source remakes like this and Dungeon Keeper is a true classic. KeeperFX has hit the big 1.0!</p>
<p>Originally released in 1997 from Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts. The developers on KeeperFX say the main goal is to preserve and expand upon the original Dungeon Keeper experience, offering many new features, improvements, and much more while staying true to the original feeling of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16281669691699962057gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16281669691699962057gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You should hopefully be able to run it with Wine, but perhaps with more eyes on it people can work towards getting it running properly on Linux?</p>
<p>Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7/10/11 support.</li>
<li>Higher screen resolutions.</li>
<li>Modernized controls.</li>
<li>Many bugfixes.</li>
<li>Additional campaigns and maps.</li>
<li>New level script commands.</li>
<li>New creatures, textures and sprites.</li>
<li>Multiplayer.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://keeperfx.net/" target="_blank">official site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dkfans/keeperfx" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Much like other remakes it needs the original data files which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dungeon_keeper" target="_blank">grab on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Mega Crit (Slay the Spire) and Null Games now funding Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More good news for the free and open source Godot Engine, as they've announced two more fun names have joined in to help fund further development.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://null.com/" target="_blank">Null Games</a> who say they are "part of a new wave of indie publishers that put developers first" and their "publishing agreement has some of the most developer-friendly terms there are". They've joined Godot as a Silver Sponsor.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://www.megacrit.com/" target="_blank">Mega Crit</a>, developer of the popular Slay the Spire, who have joined Godot as a Gold Sponsor. Recently Mega Crit released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/slay-the-spire-devs-release-dancing-duelists-after-abandoning-unity-for-godot/" target="_blank">Dancing Duelists after abandoning Unity for Godot</a> as their first test game released using Godot and it's quite fun.</p>
<p>We also recently had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/robot-gentleman-dev-of-60-seconds-blasts-unity-switches-to-godot-and-increases-funding/" target="_blank">Robot Gentleman dev of 60 Seconds!</a> join up with Godot, and Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic donated a big sum too</a> along with ongoing support.</p>
<p>Going by the current <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Development Fund</a> they've dipped just below €50K a month now from 1,331 members and 15 sponsors. So it's still going strong, which is good news as Godot 4.2 is fast approaching with Godot 4.2 beta 6 released only <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-6/" target="_blank">yesterday</a> and they say the "4.2 stable release is drawing near".</p>

      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still need more Vampire Survivors in your life? A line of official merchandise is out now.</p>
<p>The Arizona-based online gaming merchandise store <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/" target="_blank">Fangamer</a> is currently running their annual week-long Black Friday event, combining a sale, discounted international shipping, and new items based on various games. This year's event has kicked off with the launch of a selection of items based on poncle's breakout hit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a> - which, as we all know, happens to be Linux native and Steam Deck Verified.</p>

<a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/vampire-survivors" target="_blank">Catalogued here</a>, the first wave consists of a t-shirt bearing a "Swarm" design, a spinning pin of Queen Sigma, and pin-sets featuring Giovanna Grana, Krochi Freetto, and O'Sole Meeo.</p>
<p>Other games due to be covered over the course of the week are <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Native Linux, Steam Deck Playable</a>), <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/pizza-tower" target="_blank">Pizza Tower</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/" target="_blank">Proton, Steam Deck Verified</a>), <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/tunic" target="_blank">Tunic</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/" target="_blank">Proton, Steam Deck Verified</a>), and <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/rollercoaster-tycoon" target="_blank">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> (whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1368820/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_3_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank">most recent entry</a> is Steam Deck Playable via Proton).</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.2 Preview adds Steam Deck OLED support, Steam Deck back in Top 10 Sellers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a Preview update for SteamOS to ensure the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED</a> is fully supported. Plus, thanks to the recent price changes, the Steam Deck is back to being in the top sellers.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3800535912301292659" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.2</a> you need to be in Preview via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel. It's a small one though in terms of the specific list of changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Steam Deck OLED</li>
<li>Removed spurious splash screen during reboot and shutdown</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not to say what's inside is small though, as all the additions needed in SteamOS itself are important to make sure it fully supports the Steam Deck OLED. Which <em>should</em> also ensure smoother transitions for people moving an SSD over from an LCD Steam Deck to the OLED Steam Deck which Valve said to me via email that it should work without issue around November 16th with a software update.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Steam Deck is back up high in the Weekly Top Sellers with it being number 1 in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/GB/2023-11-7" target="_blank">UK</a> for the last week, and number 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2023-11-7" target="_blank">globally</a> (in supported regions). This is thanks to the 256GB LCD model now being cheaper, while the 64GB and 512GB LCD models have a big price-drop until they sell out since they're being phased-out.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 35: The New Stories</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-34-abusing-the-system/" target="_blank">Part 34: Abusing the System</a></strong></p>
<p>Just like with the original <em>Quake</em>, it did not take long for established publishers to seek out new and aspiring game development talent to create third party expansion content for <em>Quake II</em>. The first out the gate was <em>Juggernaut: The New Story For Quake II</em> released by HeadGames Publishing in early 1998, soon to be followed by a number of other packs including <em>Zaero</em> developed by Team Evolve and published by our old friends at Macmillan Digital Publishing.</p>
<p>Like with the unofficial <em>Quake</em> expansions you need to copy the data directories over to your <em>Quake II</em> install, which <em>Juggernaut</em> complicates by hiding this behind an InstallShield installer. On Linux you can use the Unshield utility to extract the contents of the data1.cab file, but the file cases will be all over the place; not an issue under Windows, but a headache for case sensitive Linux systems. To save myself a migraine, I assembled a shell script that outputs the proper file name cases.</p>
<p>From there you can launch <em>Quake II</em> with the "+set game JUGFULL" parameter, although under Windows the STORY.AVI movie file will play in a separate window at launch, something that can be bettered on Linux by using MPlayer. Most expansion packs for <em>Quake II</em> rely on a separate library file to inject new game code, but <em>Juggernaut</em> instead functions as a base total conversion, with only the art and level assets being modified. The result is even more amateurish, but at least it is portable.</p>
<p>While not as awful as some bad faith reviewers have claimed, <em>Juggernaut</em> is a victim of its two month development time, with it suffering from the desire to be the first expansion to hit store shelves. The prevalence of unmodified <em>Quake II</em> assets in spite of the original setting betrays this, as well as in the rushed nature of some of the additions, with the new levels being linear with no marked secrets. This incongruity stops <em>Juggernaut</em> from reaching its full potential, but fun can still be had with it.</p>
<p>The opening Ice Caves make a poor introduction with the decision to start you with a Chaingun, inviting you to burn through all your bullets and be stuck with just the Blaster. <em>Juggernaut</em> does find its feet later on in the campaign after the Callistans invade Europa proper, even with the enemy counts rising to the levels seen in some slaughter maps. Neither expansion pack features original music, but both will play the <em>Quake II</em> CD-ROM tracks apart from on the "Living Quarters" map of <em>Juggernaut</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15368593141699904050gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15368593141699904050gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10810174011699904051gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10810174011699904051gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Zaero</em>, on the other hand, hews far closer to the official mission packs, with you taking the role of an elite pilot whose squadron gets stranded on Stroggos. Installing <em>Zaero</em> is much simpler, with the data folder being right there on the root of the CD-ROM, and formal Linux support even being offered through a library file included as part of the official zaero-1.1-2.zip patch archive; after that I just had to make the pak0.PAK file lowercase.</p>
<p>After launching with the "+set game zaero" parameter you would think it would be all plain sailing from here, but <em>Zaero</em> proved to be faultier than <em>Juggernaut</em> even was. Attempting to use the new Plasma Shield Generator causes the game to abort with a segmentation fault, which is not a huge problem as you never have to equip it, but it does make one of the recorded demo files segfault too. All of the other new additions seemed to function properly; that is, until I reached the final boss.</p>
<p>Something that the boss will sometimes fire will also trigger a segmentation fault, turning <em>Zaero</em> into a horror game where if you stare at the boss for too long the game will break. Cheese tactics can mitigate this, but <em>Zaero</em> also steals all of your equipment at the start of the boss level, and he can let loose an EMP Nuke when injured to disable your weapons for a spell. By exploiting the overhead pipes and crouching on stairs, not to mention a lot of save scumming, I did manage to scrape a win.</p>
<p>A lot of the new additions seem inspired by <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, with the introduction of laser tripwires and security camera feeds. There are also now turrets, which are at least less irksome than those in <em>Ground Zero</em>, and can often be disabled. All of the new enemies veer towards the obnoxious, with the Sentinels being powerful bullet sponges who seem to exist to compel you to use the IRED Devices and EMP Nukes to save on ammo; <em>Zaero</em> proves stingy with its arsenal for most of the campaign.</p>
<p>As expected both <em>Juggernaut</em> and <em>Zaero</em> produced the same sporadic lock ups I experienced with the rest of <em>Quake II</em>, although I did notice that they became far worse here when I cranked up the difficulty in <em>Juggernaut</em> and had more enemies spawning in. Say what you will about these expansions packs, they at least took more effort on the part of the publisher than just grabbing a bunch of freely distributed packages off the internet and burning them to a disc. Time to get out my shovel again.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED initial quick-look and Q&amp;A Part 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED was recently revealed by Valve</a> for release on November 16th, so I've spent as much time as I possibly can tinkering with it, testing it, playing games and more since Valve sent over a review unit.</p>
<p>My early impression with it is one of big surprise, because it really is a genuinely huge upgrade over the original.</p>
<p>See my quick initial video on it arriving:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_c0UaWgVGZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dba59f4cb79221598fdfa0df1c83f6c5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_c0UaWgVGZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Lots and lots of questions have been asked about it too, so I bundled up some of the early questions to do a first Q&amp;A video as well with some demos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v-tFH1kO-BM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d47a950e7ac17b8dc70b29f9e235e71c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v-tFH1kO-BM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Now is the time to ask away: what do you want to know? What do you want / need tested? I'll be gathering many more questions on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube</a> and on here to answer in future.</p>
<p>Just like with the original model — you can expect ongoing reports on how it's doing and regular game testing.</p>

      <title>WHAT THE GOLF? gets an &#39;Among Golf Update&#39; out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's something a little suspicious about the latest WHAT THE GOLF? update, with the Among Golf Update adding a bit of Among Us flavour. Still one of the funniest games I've played in the last few years, and well worth picking up.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? For the uninitiated: it's a silly physics-based golf parody where every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd you will ask yourself: WHAT THE GOLF? It's a really silly game that will make you laugh.</p>
<p>In the new update the developers said to "Expect betrayal, vending machines, surprises, space rockets, UFOs, vents, cats and other vaguely related items that are great for golfing!" and that you can expect "more regular new levels to play in the next few months" now this is done.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big release of the video recording software OBS Studio 30.0 now available, bringing with it some new features and fixes. One of my favourite bits of open source software, as OBS Studio is something I use regularly for pretty much all of the videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTub</a>e for gameplay capture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12055608551699891218gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12055608551699891218gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Wine 8.20 brings DirectMusic improvements and preparations for Wine 9.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting close to the end of 2023 now and so the preparations for the Wine 9.0 release are starting and the Wine 8.20 development release is out now.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.20" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>More DirectMusic implementation.</li>
<li>Protocol associations exported to the Unix desktop.</li>
<li>Code cleanups in preparation for code freeze.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>20 bugs were noted to be solved this time including one from 2010 which was for "<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22904" target="_blank">Register URL protocol handlers under Linux</a>".

      <title>Steam Deck (LCD), reviewed by a portables enthusiast</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> During the writing of this article, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" target="_blank">Valve announced an OLED revision of the Steam Deck</a>. This review only covers the original LCD version.</em></p>
<p>The handheld gaming space has always been one steeped in both nostalgia and potential. Then Valve came along with their first entry in it, and reminded me of exactly why I love it in the first place.</p>
<p>I've been a desktop Linux user for 16 years, and two years ago, after a number of disappointments, I finally left the console space behind and moved all of my gaming over to Linux as well, and discovered the existence of Steam for Linux and Proton in the process.</p>
<p>I've always had a fascination with miniaturised and/or portable computing and gaming devices - Penny's Computer Book and matching watch from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcF2LOaLgA0" target="_blank">the 1983 cartoon series Inspector Gadget</a> gave my younger self a glimpse at where downsized technology could easily go, and it turned out to be surprisingly accurate! It all snowballed from there, starting with a trio of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display" target="_blank">VFD</a> tabletop games - Grandstand's <a href="http://handheldempire.com/game.jsp?game=936" target="_blank">Munchman</a>, Gakken's <a href="http://handheldempire.com/game.jsp?game=824" target="_blank">Frogger</a>, and Tomy's <a href="http://handheldempire.com/game.jsp?game=1869" target="_blank">Caveman</a> - followed by a <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/C64C" target="_blank">Commodore 64C</a>. The tabletops defined how I played video games for life, and though I have owned and used desktop computers and home video game consoles as well, handhelds and portables are still my primary choice and preference to this day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9835784431699768861gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9835784431699768861gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Grandstand Munchman, Gakken Frogger, and Tomy Caveman. Pictures from <a href="http://handheldempire.com/" target="_blank">Handheld Empire</a>.</em></p>
<p>Until recently, I was using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win_Max" target="_blank">GPD Win Max 2021</a> (a half-sized laptop with in-built gaming controls that register as an Xbox 360 controller) running Linux Mint as my main gaming PC, but whilst GPD makes some nice hardware, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">the company's reaction to the Steam Deck and treatment of content-creators in the wake of that</a> left me questioning whether I would opt for their products again now that more affordable options for handheld PCs are available. More importantly, there's a world of difference between having a control-pad built into a laptop that's designed to run a standard desktop operating-system, and having a machine that's specifically designed to play video games well, and over time I found that I really wanted something more purpose-built.</p>
<p>In the dedicated gaming-portables space (i.e., not mobile phones or tablets), the general expectation is that a device will be is a set target for developers for at least five years, with particularly successful machines (such as the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy" target="_blank">Game Boy</a>, which kept going and going for almost a decade before being replaced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color" target="_blank">Game Boy Colour</a>) lasting for at least a few years longer than that. I was very kindly given a 512GB Steam Deck for my 40th birthday, which fell about 18 months after the device's launch, and at this point in the Deck's life devs are starting to take proper notice of it, with plenty aiming to at least have their stuff working on it at or close to launch, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-update-includes-a-fix-for-linux-gamers/" target="_blank">some now even making Linux-specific tweaks</a> for non-Steam Deck systems even when they don't officially support the OS. It's also seen many updates and refinements to make for a smoother experience, and that's where I'll start this review properly.</p>
<p>Jumping in now, the out-of-the-box experience of setting up the Steam Deck is an absolute breeze - when you first unbox the unit you're greeted by an information card advising you to plug the device in before powering it on, and from there, I found the setup to be much more fluid and intuitive than that of the leading handheld brand. Once you've set your language and provided your Steam details, you're given a guided-tour of the device's main screen (which you can repeat at any time you wish by long-pressing the "..." button on the right-hand side of the Steam Deck and choosing "Repeat Tour" from the bottom of the menu that appears), and are then free to do whatever you want. The only issue that I ran into was a "Compatibility tool failed" error when trying to run the very first game that I'd installed, but this was on me - I hadn't noticed that Proton had not been downloaded yet. Hopefully this can be better signposted in the future as I felt that this was easy to miss whilst adjusting to a new interface, though I admit that I'm not sure how best to do that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1740020021699768854gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1740020021699768854gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Oops.</em></p>
<p>In retrospect, the only real quibble that I have with the setup process is that the incredibly-charming tutorial-game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/" target="_blank">Aperture Desk Job</a>, isn't pre-installed. I fumbled around trying to figure out and memorise a couple of the button-shortcuts for certain tasks at first, and when I eventually got to installing and playing the game, I realised that I would've been better off playing that before anything else, as gamifying it made it so much easier to remember! Aperture Desk Job is a must-play - it wraps up a well-designed introduction to the new hardware in a very personable and fun way that you don't often see nowadays (this used to be the task of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack-in_game" target="_blank">pack-in games</a> on consoles, which is a practise that's almost died off completely nowadays), and for the half-hour that it takes to go through it, it's well worth experiencing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15547254681699768860gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15547254681699768860gol12971.jpg"/></a></p>

<em>The case, inside and out.</em></p>
<p>Outside of the software, the inclusion of a carrying-case with the Steam Deck is a great touch. In the handheld console space, you're usually looking at an additional cost of at least £10 to £20 for a case, and they're usually not as high-quality as this; You also get a branded cleaning-cloth and a small mesh bag for little accessories, too (you can just about fit the dock into it, but I'm not sure if that's the intent or not). It's well-made and well-designed, with wells carved out on the inside for the protruding controls and grips, and a cavity on the back covered with a wide elastic strap, which seems to be for storing the power-adapter as it slots right into this space. I liked this design choice, as console carry-cases usually only make room for smaller US-sized power-adapters and not the larger ones that we have in the UK, and doing it this way solves that issue in a fairly tidy manner.</p>

<em>Examples of the Steam Deck advising the user of how their games will work on the hardware.</em></p>
<p>Back to the software! Venturing further into using the device after the intial setup demonstrated more of the care that's gone into the interface-design: The Steam Deck shows various bits of helpful advice when you go to install and run your games, ranging from Steam Deck compatibility information, to warning you if you might need to use the built-in magnifying feature and telling you how to do so, to, of course, letting you know which inputs you'll be controlling your games with. This left a good first impression.</p>
<p>The on-screen keyboard also left a good first impression when I needed to use it (and you can use it in Desktop Mode as well, though you wouldn't want to do this for long periods of time), though it's unfortunate that not all keys are available! However, you can map the ones absent from the virtual keyboard to physical buttons as needed, which somewhat negates this. As a nice bonus, it's labelled with Steam Deck button-inputs for commonly-used keys, and also allows you to navigate it with the Deck's various controller inputs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20334766171699768861gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20334766171699768861gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Super Bomberman R 2's single-player mode.</em></p>
<p>The first game with which I put my Steam Deck's controls through their paces was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1913740/SUPER_BOMBERMAN_R_2/" target="_blank">Super Bomberman R 2</a>, which released on September 13th 2023. This was my most-eagerly-awaited game in many, many years, and due to having a free day at the time, I proceeded to spend a non-stop 9.5 hour session on it at launch. Well, almost! I took a few breaks, though the Steam Deck itself remained running the entire time, partly on battery and partly plugged in. Throughout my time spent with the game, neither the Deck's inputs or my hands and wrists experienced any issues whatsoever. At the time of writing (now with 151 hours clocked with the game), I feel confident in saying that the controls have proven themselves to be well-made, durable, and reliable; I expect my handhelds to have precise controls that I can trust, and the Steam Deck definitely delivers that. (As an aside, I never expected to use the four back-buttons at all, but they've proven to be very useful for mapping extra functions to. At the very least, I always use the L4 button for a more convenient way of taking screenshots!)</p>

<em>Hotshot Racing on Deck.</em></p>
<p>Super Bomberman R 2 launched as Steam Deck Unknown (though it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/super-bomberman-r-2-granted-steam-deck-playable-status/" target="_blank">later given a Steam Deck Playable rating</a>) but worked perfectly on the Deck at launch regardless. Speaking of which, it's worth testing anyway even in cases where a game is labelled as Steam Deck Unsupported, because outdated information can unfortunately persist for a while in the ratings. I encountered this with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/609920/Hotshot_Racing/" target="_blank">Hotshot Racing</a>, which actually works perfectly on the hardware now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3672389521699768859gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3672389521699768859gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>A Steam Deck with a Nintendo Switch loaned by a relative for this photo.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat relating to the controls are the ergonomics. I get occasional carpal tunnel issues, but in my experience the Steam Deck is completely comfortable to hold and doesn't aggravate that at all, which is a refreshing change from a lot of other handhelds of the last decade or so - many devices are now often overly-thin and therefore painful to use. The shape and centre-of-gravity of the Steam Deck are well-thought-out; I had been told to expect the device to be large and heavy compared to other options on the market (and being short, it can actually cover my entire forearm and palm!), but it turned out to be a lot lighter and more well-balanced than I expected.</p>
<p>The force-feedback may as well not be there - it's super-weak, and you get just as much movement out of the speakers when they're at or near full volume. I can take or leave this feature in a handheld, though, as they don't usually have rumble at all, so I didn't find this to be a big deal.</p>
<p>Prior to getting my Steam Deck, I had heard it said that its display (with a resolution of 1280x800 - the industry-standard for handhelds of this size at this time) was a bit washed-out. I don't know if it's a difference in perception or the use of different parts at this point in the hardware's life, but I've found the screen on mine to be perfectly vibrant no matter what I've thrown at it.</p>
<p>The build-quality, at least with my particular unit, is superb, with solid, hardy materials throughout - I've owned devices from bigger names that weren't as well-made as this. There is a bit of flex in the area around the top vent, but that's expected since it's the narrowest part of the casing and it's necessary to have a bunch of holes there. Hopefully it won't be prone to warping from the heat, as is the case with other handhelds with similar vents, but only time will tell.</p>

Bomberman Hero, running via Mupen64Plus-Next in RetroDECK.</em></p>
<p>The convenience of Steam (and Proton) is one of the main draws of the Steam Deck, but since it's really just a PC in console clothing you're not restricted to that alone, and it's easily possible to add non-Steam games and software to the device. However, this option is kept in desktop-mode (where it can be done by right-clicking any shortcut and choosing "Add to Steam"), which serves the purpose of keeping gaming-mode clean and simple. At the time of writing I haven't used this feature very much, but I did add <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a> by following <a href="https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2022/12/02/minetest-steam-deck/" target="_blank">this helpful article by one of its developers</a>, followed by <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a> (by far my favourite emulation solution for the system), and it worked flawlessly. My only quibble with the process is that out of the box it's a bit fiddly to add artwork for non-Steam games, but this is an overall Steam issue, not a Deck-specific one, and I'm told that third-party solutions are available to deal with this. Adding Minetest was also how I learned that Valve allows for the uploading and downloading of community control layouts for non-Steam content, which is really handy!</p>

<em>Setting up a Netflix shortcut in Desktop Mode, to add as non-Steam software.</em></p>

<em>Netflix in Gaming Mode.</em></p>
<p>You can also add Firefox shortcuts to streaming-services as non-Steam items so that you can directly access them from Gaming Mode (in fact, you can do this with any URL or just the browser on its own). This is a little clunky, as sometimes you'll need to manually set the Web Browser controller-template but other times you won't, and at present if you map a button to switch to full-screen you'll become unable to interact with the browser at all. However, if you really want to quickly access the likes of Netflix and Disney+ from the Deck's main interface, then it is at least possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9128628491699768856gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9128628491699768856gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Dinky dock.</em></p>
<p>I was given a Steam Deck Docking Station alongside my Steam Deck, as well, and found setting that up to be just as easy as the main hardware - when I first connected it, the Deck informed me that an update needed to be applied to the dock, and once this was done, it worked correctly right away. Though the Steam Deck's dock is not quite as "automagic" as the one provided with the leading brand of dockable handheld due to having to manually plug the device in (which gives a satisfying little click to let you know that it's been done right), I found that it worked better for me overall, which makes the lack of drop-in connectivity a worthy trade-off.</p>
<p>The Deck dock has correctly detected every monitor I've used it with, and instantly works with them. This was not my experience of the other handheld brand, which often would not co-operate with particular monitors and cables, leading to no output and a lot of frustration, and it also required users to sit at a short distance and a funny angle in order to make its included wireless controllers work properly, which the Steam Deck does not ask of you when using wireless joypads.</p>
<p>If you wish to use external speakers when docking the Steam Deck, you'll want to have an amplifier handy. My monitor lacks in-built speakers, and when hooking up a set of Logitech Z120 speakers (USB-powered speakers with a standard 3.5mm plug), they ended up pretty quiet compared to the Deck's own, even though this is not the case when using other devices. This was not an issue when using wired earbuds - the Steam Deck can drive those just fine, and this ended up being a surprisingly immersive part of my docked testing.</p>
<p>The dock is a nice, compact little add-on that's easy to take wherever your Deck goes (of the gear needed to play games on a TV or monitor, it's the smallest component by far), and there are also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/gulikit-reveal-snes-styled-dock-for-steam-deck-and-other-handhelds/" target="_blank">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/jsaux-launch-their-steam-deck-rgb-backplate-and-rgb-docking-station/" target="_blank">third</a>-party <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/jsaux-m2-ssd-steam-deck-docking-station-gets-a-sale-adding-a-65w-charger-too/" target="_blank">options</a> as well, if Valve's own one isn't your cup of tea.</p>

<em>Two players venture into the native Linux maze-chase game, Pac-Man 256.</em></p>
<p>Hooking up wireless and wired gamepads is as simple and painless as it gets - at least for the ones that I have in my stash, including Xbox Series X (my preferred wireless controller at the moment), and a selection of wired USB RetroFlag, Xbox 360, and PowerA Nintendo Switch controllers. Local multiplayer gaming using the Steam Deck's dock is, as you would expect, great fun, and with enough controllers on hand it wasn't difficult to get some games going quite quickly. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1715980/Bail_or_JailOBAKEIDORO/" target="_blank">Bail or Jail (Obakeidoro!)</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/455400/PACMAN_256/" target="_blank">Pac-Man 256</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1913740/SUPER_BOMBERMAN_R_2/" target="_blank">Super Bomberman R 2</a> have all been big hits so far, and I'm looking forward to picking up more as time goes on.</p>

<em>Steam Deck as a laptop-replacement.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the Steam Deck isn't just for gaming - it's a full Linux PC under the hood, too! Specifically, one using KDE for its desktop environment (a DE which I hadn't used in 15 years, until now), which provides a GUI that's immediately familiar to most users, whether they have any prior Linux experience or not. On my other hardware I use Linux Mint Xfce Edition, and from experience with 1280x800 and 1280x720 devices I feel that Xfce is a better fit for the resolution used by the Steam Deck, as it doesn't try to pack so much information into a small space. However, I also understand that Xfce is probably too simplistic for most users' tastes, and feel that KDE was absolutely the right choice overall. My only major quibbles with the Steam Deck do happen to stem from this, though - not because I think that it's a bad choice, but because unfortunately I've encountered a lot of instability issues with it.</p>
<p>You can switch to Desktop Mode by long-pressing the Steam Deck's power-button, and then choosing "Switch to Desktop" from the resultant menu. For me, this is unfortunately where the troubles often begin - I've run into a lot of softlocks, hangs, and crashes when switching to and from this mode (along with some during general desktop usage), and though some of them have since been fixed by updates, some are still hanging around at this time. This instability isn't what I've come to expect from 16 years of using desktop Linux, but I'm reliably informed by others who use KDE often that my experience on the Deck isn't representative of using it with a daily-driver distro designed for desktops. That said, once you've switched into KDE and it's behaving itself, you can use the Steam Deck like any other Linux PC, and it works well for that. Plenty of software to carry out just about any task that you can think of is available from the Discover "store" GUI, and it's easy to install and manage, much the same as on any other OS, Linux or otherwise.</p>
<p>I did notice that when maximising windows in Desktop Mode using an external monitor with a higher resolution than the Steam Deck, there's an odd little quirk whereby if you do so within the 1280x800 space that corresponds to the Steam Deck's display, they will only maximise to that size, and not to the full size of the external monitor. Shifting them outside of that space before maximising them works around this. I'm told that this is due to Desktop Mode using x11 instead of Wayland. That's pretty much the only oddity that I came across aside from the aforementioned instability.</p>
<p>Using the Deck as a PC is usually perfectly responsive, and even with the problems that I've encountered it grew on me quite a bit as I was working on this review, and I could quite happily use the machine as a stand-in for a laptop or desktop if the need arises.</p>
<p>With the combination of docked gaming and desktop modes, I would say that the Steam Deck is almost like a modern equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco_Adam" target="_blank">Coleco Adam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000" target="_blank">Sega SG-1000 with SK-1100 keyboard</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_BASIC" target="_blank">Nintendo Famicom with Family BASIC keyboard</a>, but with technology that's finally caught up with the concept.</p>
<p>When running portably, battery-life for a stock LCD Steam Deck, with the only settings change being to turn the brightness down significantly from its retina-searing default, sits at about three to four hours, depending on what you're doing with it (with a charging time of about 2.5 hours when in sleep and, with the types of games I typically play, about 3 when charging whilst playing) - this is broadly similar to my experiences of any other modern Linux portable with this size of battery. At the time of writing I have yet to experiment very much with the various power-saving settings, as I primarily wanted to cover the stock experience. That said, the first time that I tried them it resulted in a 60Hz-locked title running at half-speed, leaving it feeling like an exercise in wading through mush! For games not prone to issues with cranking down the Deck's refresh-rate, I could barely tell the difference between 60Hz and 40Hz, however, so I'll certainly be doing more with that going forward. Sleep and wake also work as they should, and the Steam Deck wouldn't be half as good without them, since it allows for <em>so</em> much flexibility in how you play.</p>
<p>I don't play so-called "AAA" titles as they don't suit my tastes, so I can't comment on how the Deck experience is for those. For my taste in games - for the most part, titles in long-established genres that would often be considered "retro", which never tend to have high system-requirements even when they're new - the Steam Deck is ideal, and will last me a long time yet. I also don't play titles that use anti-cheat/anti-tamper, and thus haven't had a single issue with getting games to run. If you engage with games using those utilities, it's worth knowing that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/apex-legends-ignite-update-broke-anti-cheat-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">these things break every so often</a>, so you won't always find smooth sailing with such titles on Linux.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck's biggest downside is distribution - it's not available globally at the time of writing, and amongst the countries where it <em>is</em> available, it only has a brick-and-mortar retail presence in a few of them. I'm not an expert in this field and have no idea about the intricacies involved, so all I can say is that it's a genuine pity that Valve has yet to make the machine available as widely as possible. Hopefully this will change going forward, especially with a hardware-revision now on the horizon - one of the strengths of handhelds, aside from their portability, is usually having widespread availability, after all!</p>
<p>Would I recommend the Steam Deck as a games-console replacement? Yes and no. As a 40-something Brit who grew up <a href="https://twitter.com/ChinnyVision/status/1431393686588428289" target="_blank">when home-microcomputers were the only viable gaming platforms in the country</a>, and who has always appreciated the transferrable computing skills that I picked up from getting my start in gaming that way, I would say absolutely! And if you're a particularly budget-conscious gamer (something that was commonplace during the home-micro era due to the far lower cost of games back then), this feels like one of the best options out there, since PC gaming is generally lower-cost than console gaming, and there are often giveaways on various storefronts - and you're not forced to give up your old library when a new device comes along, either.</p>
<p>However, as someone who understands that there are always going to be problems with anti-cheat and anti-tamper on Linux, I would say that it's not the right choice for those who will want every single game in their library to just work, especially if online multiplayer titles that make use of such solutions are expected to work 100% of the time. This will only lead to frustration.</p>
<p>That said, if you want a nicely-spec'ed and versatile dockable gaming-specific handheld that's likely to be a stable target for developers for at least a few more years and which can play a truly staggering amount of games and other content out-of-the-box, and are aware of and are willing to work with the caveats, you're likely to be well-served by the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I've often heard people state that the Steam Deck's portability changed how they play games, but I'm a portables person in the first place, so I didn't expect it to make such a difference to me. I was wrong - it did, and it now goes absolutely everywhere with me, just because the user-experience is <em>so good</em>. Even better, its versatility has prompted me to step out of my comfort-zone and try games that I just wouldn't have considered before (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391720/Layers_of_Fear_2016/" target="_blank">Layers of Fear (2016)</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1837580/Mia_and_the_Dragon_Princess/" target="_blank">Mia and the Dragon Princess</a> have proven to be a couple of my favourite experiences of the year). By its very nature it's never going to be quite as plug-and-play as a console, but compared to devices that just give you gaming-controls and a standard desktop interface, the Steam Deck currently offers the best handheld gaming-PC experience out there, bar none.</p>
<p>Hopefully Valve will increase the hardware's availability and will continue making more machines like this in the future - their first handheld has set a high bar, being incredibly fun to use and feeling like it's always inviting you to play, and I'm looking forward to seeing where things will go in the years to come.</p>

      <title>Lords of the Fallen fixes up issues on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh update has landed for the recently released action-RPG Lords of the Fallen, and now it should run better on Steam Deck. Nice to see developers of bigger games continue to ensure they work well with Proton. Not to be confused with the 2014 game of the same name, this is the 2023 release.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/3798284112471151813" target="_blank">changelog</a> for November 9th they noted that online play is now "fully operational on SteamDeck" and that it will no longer crash on Steam Deck when "the Scarlet Shadow spawns". Currently the game is rated as Steam Deck Verified with Valve picking it to use Proton Experimental by default.</p>
<p>On top of dedicated Steam Deck fixes, the game should also hopefully run better as the developers put in numerous performance fixes including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Optimized certain actors in the game to increase performance in several areas.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Skyrest by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Upper Calrath marketplace square by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Castle Bramis while being in Umbral.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Penitent Path by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Skyrest Bridge by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in the Manse area by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Red Corpse Church by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance for wither entity spawning without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized performance in Lower Calrath by reducing cast shadows without reducing visual quality.</li>
<li>Optimized collision meshes in Lower Calrath - Bridge area to reduce collision counts and increase performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Valve released a fresh Beta update across Steam Deck, Steam Big Picture and SteamVR that includes lots of subtle visual tweaks to the UI to make it look a bit fancier.</p>
<p>Testing it on Steam Deck: a lot of it is tweaking the colours without changing the actual layout. First example below here is the Home section where you can see more vibrant game background art, along with the colour separation between the game list and the bottom section being removed. The bottom bar also has some transparency to it to show colours behind it rather than being a solid black. First image is the old one, second is the new one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-caption="Original Home" data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2964518351699610048gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2964518351699610048gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Original Home</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-caption="New Home" data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14286020881699610049gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14286020881699610049gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
New Home</p>
<p>Another small change noticed is in the Steam Library. It's again a bit darker, and when you move over a game in the list it will splash a bit of matching background colour around it as you'll see below again with the original first and the new look second.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-caption="Old Library" data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19536763771699611220gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19536763771699611220gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

New Library</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">General</div>
<ul>
<li>Visual tweaks to Steam Deck, Big Picture Mode and SteamVR: Many small changes throughout to make the user interface a more visually-rich experience in Home, Library and other areas.</li>
<li>Nicer layout for Soundtracks pages. These pages are now easier to navigate in Big Picture Mode and feature larger artwork on Desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed some layout and interaction bugs in the Media viewer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Steam Input</div>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Gyro Joystick mode: Core gyro quaternion is updated even when the app requesting it is not focused.</li>

      <title>Valve reveals Steam Deck OLED for November 16th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today announced the brand new Steam Deck OLED model with some great sounding upgrades inside so here's the details.</p>
<p>This is the same basics as the original Steam Deck models but comes with an HDR OLED screen, a longer lasting 50Whr battery, faster WiFi, and a slew of tweaks and improvements across the board. Valve say the HDR OLED was "designed from the ground up for gaming", gives you "30-50% longer battery life", has WiFi 6E and gives improved thermals with a bigger fan while being 5% lighter than the original models. Oh, the OLED screen is also bigger at 7.4" (from 7.0") and goes up to 90Hz!</p>
<p>It will also come with a brand new carrying case for the 1TB models that has a removable liner, better touch-screen, easier repairs with Torx type screws that go into metal threads, so no messing up the structural integrity and Valve say the internal components are "now easier to access, and Steam Deck OLED replacement parts will be coming to iFixit soon". Even the APU was upgraded to 6nm for better efficiency, and the memory was updated to 6400 MT/s, improving latency and power management.</p>
<p>Not just that, you're also getting lower-priced models with the original LCD screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck 256GB LCD: Now $399 / £349 (effective immediately)</li>
<li>Steam Deck 512GB OLED: $549 / £479</li>
<li>Steam Deck 1TB OLED: $649 / £569</li>
<li>Steam Deck 1TB OLED Limited Edition (translucent colorway): $679 (US/Canada only)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Deck OLED will be available November 16th at 10 AM Pacific / 6PM UTC in USA, Canada, United Kingdom, and European Union, as well as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong via <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">KOMODO</a>.</p>
<p>However, the 64GB and 512GB LCD models are now being phased-out so they have a permanent discount until they are gone so while supplies last (prices effective immediately):</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck 64GB LCD: Now $349 / £309</li>
<li>Steam Deck 512GB LCD: Now $449 / £389</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_vTsZMvjJ-A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/072296d04fa7453b4c1d738c48dbaebd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_vTsZMvjJ-A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their tech specs, it even mentions it has "support for wake from Bluetooth controllers", which I'm sure will be exciting to anyone who plans to regularly dock it.</p>
<p>The Docking Station is now priced at $79 / £69.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck Store</a> and the refreshed <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/oled" target="_blank">Steam Deck Website</a>.</p>
<p>I do have a review unit on the way, which is supposed to arrive today. So stay tuned for my thoughts and comparisons on it. Exciting times to be a Linux gaming fan!</p>

      <title>Modders already improving the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 out now on Steam and in many ways disappointing, so modders are already working to improve it.</p>
<p>Currently it's still a little broken on Steam Deck / Linux, but Valve have recently put out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/proton-experimental-fixes-up-multiple-final-fantasy-issues-metal-gear-solid-3/" target="_blank">new Proton Experimental update</a> that should help METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version crashing before the opening cutscene but still has broken audio. A fix for crashing and audio is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/heres-how-to-fix-metal-gear-solid-2-and-3-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">noted in my previous article</a> for both MGS 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Now modders are jumping in to make the collection better, well not for Metal Gear Solid 1 though, as the "Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Fix" only supports Metal Gear 1/2, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.</p>
<p>What does it give you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom resolution/ultrawide support.</li>
<li>Experimental 16:9 HUD option that resizes HUD/movies (MGS2/MGS3).</li>
<li>Borderless/windowed mode.</li>
<li>Mouse cursor toggle.</li>
<li>Mouse sensitivity adjustment (MGS3).</li>
<li>Correct gameplay/cutscene aspect ratio (MGS2/MGS3).</li>
<li>Skip intro logos (MGS2/MGS3).</li>
<li>Adjustable anisotropic filtering (MGS2/MGS3).</li>
<li>Increased texture size limits. (MG1/MG2/MGS3).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5455781071699537635gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5455781071699537635gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds like some really nice quality of life additions and the mod is easy to install too.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/MGSHDFix#metal-gear-solid-master-collection-fix" target="_blank">out on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve refines new Steam Deck Unified Frame Limit slider to show Refresh Rate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available currently in the Steam Deck Preview <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-preview-update-has-a-unified-refresh-rate-and-framerate-limit-slider/" target="_blank">that I recently covered</a>, there's a new Unified Frame Rate and Refresh Rate slider but Valve has done a useful tweak in the latest update.</p>
<p>Originally you would separately change the Frame Limit and Refresh Rate, now it's in one slider to make it much simpler for users (although you can change it back in the Display Settings). They've now changed it further so it will list <em>both</em> the Frame Limit and Refresh Rate together to make it clearer.</p>
<p>As you see in the shots below, it automatically picks the best Refresh Rate based on what you're setting the Frame Limit to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9017551181699536343gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9017551181699536343gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17679908021699536344gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17679908021699536344gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3787024475501064561" target="_blank">Changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed setting the correct AppID in Source SDK mod manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preview Only</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the framerate limit slider to include the screen's current refresh rate.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the framerate limit would not apply to some external displays.</li>
<li>Framerate limit settings are now stored separately for each display.</li>
</ul>

      <title>WWI FPS &#39;Isonzo&#39; free White War expansion is live, free weekend and big discount coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Get ready to try out the brutal WWI FPS Isonzo, as they've just recently released a free new expansion and it's set for a Steam Free Weekend and big discount.</p>
<p>"Fight among snow-covered peaks and conquer the Queen of the Dolomites: the Marmolada! In the White War expansion, the battle will take place in and above the Ice City that the Austro-Hungarians carved out beneath the Marmolada glacier."</p>
<p>With this new map also comes new weapons with the M14 Repetiergewehr for Austro-Hungarian soldiers, the Vetterli mod. 1870 for the Italian army and the Gewehr 1871/84 for German troops. Optionally there's also a new Glacial Units Pack cosmetics DLC.</p>

<p>Creative Director and founder of BlackMill Games Jos Hoebe says: “The battles that took place in the Alps are some of the most iconic of the First World War, in which soldiers had to fight nature just as much, if not more, than they did each other. These beautiful and deadly landscapes inspired us to create Isonzo and bring the war to these heights, and so we are excited to launch the White War, starting with the Marmolada map. And of course we have much more planned around these mountains that we can’t wait to reveal!”</p>
<p>Today at 7PM CET / 6PM UTC the game will also go on its first Steam Free Weekend, so anyone will be able to download and play for free until November 13th. On top of that it will also get a big discount at the same time with 67% off and the sale will last until November 28th.</p>

      <title>SteamOS-like Linux package Bazzite 2.0 is out now for Steam Deck and desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want an alternative to SteamOS (or Steam Deck OS as Valve sometimes decides to call it) for your Steam Deck, desktop PC or living room gaming machine - <a href="https://universal-blue.org/blog/2023/11/08/bazzite-20/#welcome-to-phase-ii-of-bazzite" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> is an interesting pick. Much like <a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, it aims to give you a good gaming experience.</p>
<p>As a reminder though: technically, Bazzite is not what you would call a traditional "Linux distro". It's built on top on <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main" target="_blank">ublue-os/main</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia" target="_blank">ublue-os/nvidia</a> giving you good hardware support with the upstream projects handling things like maintenance and security updates with Bazzite simply expanding it into something better for gamers.</p>
<p>This "Phase II" of Bazzite upgrades the base to Fedora Linux 39 and they say it's "now at a point where it is completely functional as is on standard hardware (and the Steam Deck.)" and while the original focus was on providing something like SteamOS but be more flexible the scope has expanded to work on much more hardware.</p>
<p>Some of the features it offers:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bazzite itself is split across multiple versions, depending on what type of experience / device you're going to be using it on but in a single download where you will pick inside the installer what you wish to install either the Desktop variant or Steam Deck/HTPC.</p>
<p>So if you choose the version for a console-like experience like the Steam Deck it will directly boot into a Gaming Mode just like SteamOS on Steam Deck does so you'll get the Big Picture Mode experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19585256441699531526gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19585256441699531526gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The Steam Deck / HTPC version also includes various other enhancements like options to install Decky Loader, EmuDeck, RetroDECK, and ProtonUp-Qt, among numerous other useful packages on installation. There's also upgraded Mesa drivers, a custom update system to deal with OS / Flatpaks / Nix packages (Via Fleek) and Distrobox images to be updated directly from the Gamemode UI, built-in support for Windows dual-boot and much more.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 gets a first Alpha release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nearly 10 years after KDE Plasma 5.0, the launch of KDE Plasma 6.0 is approaching and a first "Megarelease - Alpha" is out now for testing. KDE Plasma is the desktop environment used on the Steam Deck's desktop mode, and my current favourite for my own desktop with Kubuntu.</p>
<p>This Alpha release includes KDE Plasma 6, lots of updates to all the KDE Gear applications (file explorers, music and video players etc), upgrades to KDE's Frameworks (for devs to build apps) and moving as much as possible over to Qt6, the framework upon which Plasma is built.</p>
<p>It's difficult to list everything that's going to be new and improved because there's just so much of it. Expect better Wayland support, better performance, an improved Discover software centre, the return of the Desktop Cube effect (pictured below), the Spectacle screenshot tool finally has an option to remove shadows, new and improved colour-blind accessibility options, various improvements to System Settings layout and the list just goes on and on. Reading <a href="https://pointieststick.com/" target="_blank">Nate Graham's blog</a> goes over a lot.</p>

      <title>Night in the Woods follow-up Revenant Hill cancelled due to developer health issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sad news for anyone excited for Revenant Hill, which would have been the follow-up game to the exceptionally well reviewed indie game Night in the Woods as it has been cancelled.</p>
<p>The website for developers <a href="https://theglorysociety.com/" target="_blank">The Glory Society</a> has been replaced with a statement on things ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>​Making anything complex poses challenges along the way. Games take a while to make and usually require a good team working together. We've been lucky to have one such good team. Unfortunately, recent serious health issues have necessitated two key members stepping away from the project indefinitely. We are a small team and we each wear multiple hats. This is a loss of several hard to replace hats in an environment where all hats are needed. Given the realities of schedules, budgets, and the fraught task of reworking the whole project within those parameters, the team has amicably decided to suspend operations. For all intents and purposes, this is the end of the development of Revenant Hill.<br/>
<br/>
We are a cooperative, and we make decisions as a group. For us, this was the clear path to take for the well-being of the team, which is frankly more important than games. In the future, after the dust has settled, perhaps we'll talk about what we've made and learned together. In the meantime, we want to thank everyone who worked with us, supported us, and believed in us<br/>
Sometimes things happen beyond your control that change the available options and you just have to roll with it together. Glory was a project in and of itself, and it’s one we’re proud to have been part of. Thank you for caring about what we did. Take care of each other, and support the workers doing the labor of making the games you love. We'll see you around.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;3 The Glory Society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shame, I know a few people who said Night in the Woods was one of their absolute favourite games, so I was quite keen to see Revenant Hill too. All the best to the developers.</p>

      <title>Over a week later Apex Legends is still broken on Linux / Steam Deck (update: fixed)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 08/11/23, 18:31 UTC</strong> - They just put out a patch that solves it. Over a week to put back a single removed file. I groan, but at least it's sorted now.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One of the most popular titles on Steam, Apex Legends, has been left broken on Linux / Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/apex-legends-ignite-update-broke-anti-cheat-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">for over a week now</a> after the Ignite Update. You can fix it yourself though, if you want to risk it.</p>
<p>The problem: they seem to have accidentally removed the Easy Anti-Cheat .so file that it needs to work with Proton, so it just doesn't let you in due to it not detecting that the anti-cheat is actually there (because it isn't). Somehow over a week later EA / Respawn haven't just put it back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828861411699451061gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828861411699451061gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Respawn have <em>confirmed</em> they're looking into it, as-per their <a href="https://trello.com/c/Nl67WWPb/430-eac-error-with-steam-deck-linux" target="_blank">Trello</a> page that currently lists the fix as "In Progress", but it's been under the same status since they added it to their list on October 31st. For a game that's Steam Deck Verified, this is quite a nuisance. And since it's <em>not</em> the first time it's happened - you have to wonder why it's taking so long.</p>
<p>If you want to fix it yourself <strong>at your own risk</strong>, you just need to grab a copy of the missing file (like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/te2i42/comment/i0n4y0p/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this one</a> on Reddit from when it happened before) and place it back into the installed folder. The location depends on what Steam Library you have it installed in somewhere like <code class="inline-code">/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Apex Legends/</code></p>
<p>This will allow it to work again but I don't recommend it, always best to wait for their official fix. But if you're <em>desperate</em> to play at least it works.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 39 is out now with GNOME 45, Linux kernel 6.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Fedora team <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-39/" target="_blank">announced</a> the release of Fedora Linux 39 yesterday November 7th, bringing with it GNOME 45 and a ton of other improvements for one of the most popular desktop Linux distributions.</p>
<p>It's not all about GNOME though as there's upgraded flavours of Fedora that come with <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/" target="_blank">KDE Plasma Desktop</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/spins/xfce" target="_blank">Xfce</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/spins/cinnamon" target="_blank">Cinnamon</a>, and others. There's even the fancy newer <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/onyx/" target="_blank">Fedora Onyx</a>, an immutable desktop featuring the Budgie desktop. Coming with Linux kernel 6.5 and Mesa 23.2.1 supporting plenty of newer hardware for the best experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18755327671699449333gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18755327671699449333gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Fedora Linux 39, showing GNOME Activities Overview</em></p>
<p>Here you can expect probably the best GNOME experience, since it is their flagship desktop and they keep a pretty tight ship with the upstream GNOME project. GNOME 45 brings with it numerous new features like the Activities Indicator, fast searching, a Camera Usage Indicator, a new image viewer, a new camera app, improved settings, various Flatpak and Wayland improvements and much <em>much</em> more. Pretty much the vast majority of actual user-facing changes are from <a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/" target="_blank">GNOME 45</a>.</p>
<p>Other updates to the software includes GCC 13.2, Binutils 2.40, glibc 2.38, GDB 13.2, RPM 4.19, Python 3.12 and Rust 1.73.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-23 fixes VRChat and reworks GStreamer plugin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community-maintained GE-Proton compatibility layer has another small release out for Linux desktop / Steam Deck with GE-Proton 8-23 being released November 8th.</p>
<p>Reminder: this is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve. It may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>added reverts for vrclient to allow VRChat to work again (pending proper fix from valve: <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1199#issuecomment-1800923686" target="_blank">ValveSoftware#1199 (comment)</a>)</li>
<li>the gstreamer plugin build options have been re-worked. Rather than enabling everything under the sun, we've now manually enabled each option that was reported as enabled in previous builds, and disabled the rest. This was done to more align with what Valve is doing and to allow a clearer picture of what may be missing from Valve's proton rather than taking wild guesses. Doing this may allow Valve a better idea of additional codecs/filters that might be missing in case they need and/or can be enabled. (thanks loathingKernel for taking the time to do this)</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Nexus Mods App is an in-development replacement for Vortex that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something promising for the future of cross-platform mod support, as it seems the Nexus team are working on a new <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" target="_blank">Nexus Mods App</a>. It's in the <em>very</em> early stages (pre-alpha they say), but <em>eventually</em> they plan to have it replace the popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/" target="_blank">Vortex</a> but it's quite a long time away from that just yet.</p>
<p>While Vortex is popular, it's not supported on Linux / Steam Deck and so you need some workarounds with Wine / Proton to get it working. Having one of the most popular modding sites like Nexus actually have an <em>official</em> Linux modding client would be a nice big boost.</p>
<p>So why are they re-doing their modding app? As they mention on the GitHub page they now have a bigger team, and they plan to implement a lot of the lessons they've learned while developing Vortex into this new Nexus Mods App and the idea of easily rolling-back sounds good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest complaints of users over the years about mod managers is that they can't mod with confidence. Will a new mod wreck their existing install? Will copying some files into their game folder require them to delete the entire game if they want to revert these changes? The game updated, and the user updated their mods, now nothing works! Every step of the modding process is fraught with pitfalls and destructive changes.</p>
<p>The Nexus Mods App intends to solve these problems. In addition to being a great mod installer, manager and builder, this project aims to always provide an "undo" feature for users. Not just on a metadata level (like most mod managers offer today) but on a per-file basis as well. So go ahead, update that mod, if you don't like it, you can always go back to the game as it was before you made the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Linux support their FAQ mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I see tests run on Linux, Windows and OSX, are you targeting all those platforms?</p>
<p>A: Yes, the CLI runs on these platforms and we run our CI on each of these OSes. What games are supported on these platforms (e.g. do we support Skyrim through Wine on Linux?) is yet to be determined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and it's under the GPL license.</p>
<p>This was officially announced by the Nexus crew back in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14874" target="_blank">August</a>, but since I'm not too much into modding I missed it so <em>hat-tip</em> to <a href="https://twitter.com/hardpenguin13/status/1721652932620292578" target="_blank">HardPenguin</a> on X for notifying me.</p>

<p>However, you can disable this if you wish in the Display Settings to get it back to the original split-slider:</p>

<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3787024475496925386" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix visual glitches when dismissing a context menu in main BPM UI while a game is running</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>

<li>Fixed the "Enable Steam Input" button not being shown on Deck when manually opting controllers out of Steam Input</li>

      <title>WRATH: Aeon of Ruin finally has a release date for February 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access since 2019 and multiple launch windows missed, the Quake engine powered retro shooter WRATH: Aeon of Ruin finally has an actual real release date. No, I can't quite believe it either.</p>
<p>The developers have been putting out semi-regular update posts on Steam on their progress, but it hasn't stopped negative user reviews on Steam building up over time due to the lack of any actually <em>released</em> updates. Looking on SteamDB, the last public update released for the game was in January 2021 — that's a long time for players to wait on something new for an Early Access game.</p>
<p>Anyway, now it's set to launch on February 27th, 2024 and they put up a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CLMKbLI-nRA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af757a7ee1dc52e62510cc27b3598d9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CLMKbLI-nRA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They did release the source code some time ago that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/wrath-aeon-of-ruin-engine-source-code-released-a-quick-look/" target="_blank">contributor Samsai took a look at</a>, which also hasn't been updated on GitHub since 2021 as well. It's not clear if they still plan to provide Native Linux support, but at least if they keep the code up to date people who want that should be able to run it easily enough. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> will likely run it quite well directly from Steam (it has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB and is Steam Deck Playable).</p>
