      <title>Comedy 2.5D puzzle-platformer Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator gets a demo and new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A single-player comedy adventure 2.5D platformer developer by a former Disney ride designer, Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator looks and sounds great.</p>
<p>Coming from Adventure Works, a small production studio lead by Jeffrey Ashbrook, a former Disney parks designer and a producer on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. What we've seen of it looks incredibly promising and I'm personally looking forward to seeing more from this one. The game will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>They just released a brand new demo ahead of Steam Next Fest, and to go along with it there's new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mh6Fo0WNths"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/baa002950d9e6e34d20011a75560d24f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mh6Fo0WNths" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the origins of the game, Jeffrey Ashbrook, founder at Adventure Works, said "I always wanted to create a game inspired by those cinematic story-driven adventures I loved growing up. I was such a big fan of ‘80s adventure films like Indiana Jones and The Goonies, and large-scale games like the Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid series, those seamless blends of cinematics and gameplay to create a memorable experience for players. Even with only a handful of devs from around the world , we wanted Ari to be that same kind of experience you used to get from much larger teams: full 3D cutscenes, ensemble casts of characters, and a story that you could really sink into if you wanted, so we’ve set our sights high and really hope people enjoy what we’ve been creating."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thrilling cinematic adventure:</strong> Embark on a rip-roaring, feel-good journey inspired by classic blockbuster adventure films.</li>
<li><strong>Eccentric ensemble cast:</strong> Interact with an eccentric and loveable cast including 11 fully voice-acted characters.</li>
<li><strong>Nostalgic puzzle platforming</strong><strong>: </strong>Journey through 13 levels and 6 distinct environments - from freezing tundras to scorching deserts.</li>
<li><strong>Stunning in-game cutscenes:</strong> Feast your eyes on stunning in-game cinematics from the mind of a former Disney producer.</li>
<li><strong>Unique tools and abilities:</strong> Unlock a repertoire of quirky tools to solve mysteries, utilize environmental elements, and tackle treacherous terrain.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184020/Ari_Buktu_and_the_Anytime_Elevator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam now</a>. There's no set date for the release yet but the demo is live now.</p>

      <title>ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius releases November 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios, developer of the popular Warhammer 40,000: Gladius, have announced their next 4x strategy game ZEPHON will release on November 8th. ZEPHON will have Native Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer sent me a pre-release key.</em></p>
<p>If you think it looks like Gladius, you would be right, since both are evolutions over Proxy Studios first game Pandora: First Contact from 2013. Here you control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>Check out their previous gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPD4MiGc2g0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc1ac8fea864939ac2780eeb0ece3d63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPD4MiGc2g0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. Zephon now has in excess of 500 k views on YouTube (including 100 k on the IGN gameplay trailer) and more than 100 k wishlists on Steam a month before release.</p>
<p>In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>You can wishlist and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Aspyr announce Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles coming to PC in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is another remaster coming from Aspyr Media, bringing over the originally console-exclusive game to PC. <em>The force appears to be strong with Aspyr.</em></p>
<p>Originally released back in the year 2000 for PlayStation, it was then released for Dreamcast and later the Game Boy Advance. Hopefully this latest Star Wars game from Aspyr will have a good release, after the mess that was the STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection but since then they seem to be doing really well with their other releases getting great reviews. I'm just happy to see more classics come to PC, so we can then play on Linux and Steam Deck thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Internet Archive hit with DDoS attacks and hacked with 31 million accounts hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sad day for the internet, as it has been confirmed that the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) that hosts a massive amount of historical data has been hit by DDoS attacks, and unfortunately they've had a breach.</p>
<p>Recently instead of seeing the website as usual, users were greeted with message like this (<a href="https://x.com/jwdomb/status/1844123760720548040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">credit</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5468299481728640690gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIBP is in reference to the popular <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPwned</a> website, that lists various data breaches and now <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#InternetArchive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">includes</a> this latest breach in their database. Troy Hunt, founder of HIBP, <a href="https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1844136762727448644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a thread on Twitter / X that it is legitimate and they had been communicating with the Internet Archive about it,</p>
<p>The breach was also <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, who said this on Twitter / X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we know: DDOS attack–fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords.</p>
<p>What we’ve done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security.</p>
<p>Will share more as we know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did briefly come back up, but was hit by another DDoS. As a result, the Internet Archive has been taken offline while their admins deal with the situation.</p>
<p>An account on Twitter / X called "Sn_darkmeta" claimed responsibility for it.</p>
<p><em>Just another reminder that you should never share passwords between websites.</em></p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is here. Canonical have announced the release of Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole), along with various flavours like Kubuntu 24.10 now being available. <em>This is not an LTS (long term support) release, but an interim release towards the next LTS.</em></p>
<p>Some of the big changes include the latest 6.11 kernel, along with Canonical's shift to "a more aggressive kernel version selection policy going forward", automatic kernel crash dumps, GNOME 47 with its various new additions to the desktop and also Wayland by default for NVIDIA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376433451728639494gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376433451728639494gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole)</em></p>
<p>You'll also find various Raspberry Pi support improvements, various improvements to the Snap packages like the new security center, additional stability and performance patches added to GNOME, Firefox 130, LibreOffice 24.8, Thunderbird 128, Pipewire 1.2.4 and the list of updates goes on and on.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-oracular-oriole-released/48652/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Gaming on Linux with Apple Silicon now becoming a very real thing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has given an update in a blog post and a presentation at XDC 2024 going over work to improve Linux gaming on the Apple M1/M2 with Asahi Linux.</p>
<p>They announced their "Asahi game playing toolkit" which brings together their Vulkan 1.3 graphics driver, and x86 emulation with Windows game compatibility (using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> amongst other things). It's all still "Alpha" level quality, but good enough to run some AAA games now. Unlike Apple's own macOS, Asahi Linux has the <em>only</em> conformant OpenGL®, OpenCL™, and Vulkan® drivers for this hardware (as Apple focus on their own API - Metal).</p>
<p>All you have to do is install the Fedora Asahi Remix on your Apple system, get the latest driver updates and then install Steam although they said "most games require 16GB of memory due to emulation overhead".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fallout 4 on Apple Hardware with Fedora Asahi Remix</em></p>
<p>Incredible work to make more hardware not only able to run Linux nicely, but become actual proper gaming machines too. Sounds like it's been a thoroughly complicated process, with many contributors but the end result looks great for users.</p>
<p>More work is to be done yet on the Honeykrisp driver, like "Sparse texturing" up next which they said will "unlock more DX12 games" but it's already good enough for titles like Fallout 4, Hollow Knight and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>More in their <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and you can see their talk during XDC 2024 - Day 2 in the below video with the talk starting at about 20:46 (they do eventually start speaking English):</p>

      <title>First Steam Deck plugin on Steam will bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a really surprising move the developers behind Decky Loader plugin <em>Junk Store</em>, which provides the ability to install games from GOG and Epic Games, are bringing the plugin to Steam officially.</p>
<p>This is a special new release just for the Steam Deck, and <em>seems</em> to indicate that Valve are open to having Steam Deck plugins available directly like this. Especially nice for all the people claiming free games (or buying) from the Epic Games Store and GOG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will <em>not</em> be free and open source like the Decky Loader plugin though, as confirmed in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g0qygm/junk_store_is_officially_coming_to_the_steam_store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, due to the work involved in re-writing it for a Steam release. A price has not been decided on it yet as they gauge interest. However, the existing plugin will remain. The developers said they plan to keep expanding it and hopefully add support for more stores too.</p>
<p>That is, <strong>if</strong> Valve <em>do</em> actually give it the true nod of approval once the Junk Store developers are ready to put it live. Valve has at least approved the Steam store page, so it it has at least passed the initial stage but it could still end up catching more attention and end up not being approved - this will be quite a test for Valve too. Just how open is Steam really on what it will allow?</p>
<p>Main features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engineered specifically for Game Mode. Once installed you can download and launch games without needing to go into Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Junk Store utilises the Steam-native interface for managing games, allowing Steam to handle most of the process.</li>
<li>Junk Store leverages Steam's built-in functionality to manage Proton prefixes.</li>
<li>You can use the QAM to adjust per game Proton settings such as FPS limiting, etc.</li>
<li>It is extensible! You can write whatever you want for Junk Store integrations if you have the skill. You don't need to wait on anyone else to add features or store front integrations.</li>
<li>Currently we have integrated support for Epic and Gog Games that ships with Junk Store.</li>
<li>Epic achievements and EOS overlay are functional for games that support this feature (however, there is no playtime tracking).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Compatibility with other stores is a common complaint with the Steam Deck. You are able to go into Desktop Mode and install whatever you want, but the convenience of having something directly on Steam will be nice.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3250950/Junk_Store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck officially comes to Australia in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Our friends down under will finally be able to buy an officially supported Steam Deck, as it heads to Australia officially in November. It's been a long road to get there, but it's finally happening which opens up Australia to other Valve hardware now too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck LCD was originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released back in February 2022</a> and was later expanded with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/steam-deck-hits-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-and-taiwan-on-december-17th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Komodo partnership</a> to also be sold in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Much <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">later in November 2023</a>, Valve then revealed the much better Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press email the prices will be (inclusive of GST):</p>
<ul>
<li>256GB LCD: $649.00 AUD</li>
<li>512GB OLED: $899.00 AUD</li>
<li>1TB OLED: $1049.00 AUD</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad pricing, and with the OLED truly being a much better device you really should grab that model if you can afford it. It's truly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the definitive Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>It's only going to get better too with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming release of SteamOS 3.6</a>.</p>
<p>Once Valve are eventually ready to talk more about a potential Steam Deck 2, this should also hopefully mean Australia won't be left out in the cold on release day. Although, it's also another signal that the current Steam Deck model is here to stay for some time yet.</p>
<p>You can follow along for more using our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Tag</a> (with a dedicated RSS feed), our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Forum Category</a> and the Steam Deck Channel in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</p>

      <title>Think you&#39;ve seen it all? There&#39;s now a Steam game about squeezing eggs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've cooked a lot of them in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/arctic-eggs-is-thoroughly-weird-physics-based-dystopian-cooking-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arctic Eggs</a> (which is really good) but have you ever just stopped for a moment to squeeze some eggs? No? Maybe you should. Released on Steam on October 1st it's now <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified and works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> perfectly on Kubuntu Linux desktop.</p>
<p>So what is it? Egg Squeeze is a "biological intuition test where you squeeze eggs for as long as you can without breaking them". No, I have no idea what's going on here either. I had to test it of course, for science, and to see if I could beat the test. Or maybe the test will beat me, or whisk me, or fry me — or whatever else you do with eggs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While you're squeezing that egg tightly, trying not to smash it inside your palm, some funky music starts playing. The longer you manage to hold down the button to squeeze before it cracks, the better your score. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell when it's about to break and it's scrambled my brain. I'm not entirely sure what exactly it is that I'm doing. It's all about testing your synergy with the eggs apparently, but how does that work? I need an answer.</p>
<p>Get multiple in a row that you managed to keep intact, and you'll build up streak, crack it open and you'll lose points. The more I played, the more confused I became, and thoroughly frustrated at the amount of eggs I had smashed open. I've touched and smooshed more eggs in this game that I have in my entire real life.</p>
<p>When you manage to hit the needed score, it's time to start a new day and…things get weird — really weird. Seems the days get progressively more difficult too, with the second day adding in an insanity bar and if you crack too many eggs it's game over, and the score you need to hit is much higher too.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lx7M7H_2iWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9b31be0b1adc8c8a06d524b7ba2da44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lx7M7H_2iWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Surprisingly tense for such a simple game too. When you're one crushed egg away from losing and you're counting in your head to a specific number and then (much like the egg) your dreams about passing the test get demolished as you let out a loud expletive <em>F—</em> with a sigh.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been chosen as a volunteer for the "Egg Squeeze" exam - a test that evaluates one's <em>psychokinetic intuition of biological makeup</em>. In each test, you will be asked to squeeze an egg for a short period of time. The objective is to estimate the egg's unique breaking point and release your grasp <strong>Before it cracks</strong>. You will be graded relative to your synergy with the eggs.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>May the eggs be ever in your favor.</strong></p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Short core game (1-3 hours)</li>
<li>"Infinite Squeeze" mode, for unlimited replayability</li>
<li>50+ track score, composed by indie game veterans</li>
<li>Plenty of secrets waiting to be found...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229170/Egg_Squeeze/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Explore a top-secret uranium mine in retro-FPS Kvark</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kvark is a new release from developer Latest Past and publisher Perun Creative, set in a fictional version of the 80s Czech Republic where you explore a top-secret uranium mine. <em>Note: my key was provided by PR Outreach.</em></p>
<p>The 1.0 release is out now, which comes with a Native Linux version after a year in Early Access. What is it? A retro-inspired FPS that pays homage to such games as Half-Life and BioShock. You can definitely tell, as it wears the inspiration on its sleeve. If you love retro inspired shooters, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBmUjnIvO4I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9627d46639b4f5bff8839207fd19ecb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBmUjnIvO4I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced fights with a plethora of weapons, from wrenches to grenades, bazookas, and the iconic EK-48.</li>
<li>Uniquely designed, diverse, and challenging enemies that require swift tactics and weapon swapping, quick thinking, and constant movement.</li>
<li>An intriguing story told through hidden notepads that the player must find to reveal.</li>
<li>Search for suspicious substances that may help you with your efforts.</li>
<li>Simple to intricate puzzles that the player will have to solve to progress.</li>
<li>Detailed, interactive levels that reward players willing to explore with hidden Easter eggs, secrets, and achievements.</li>
<li>Stylized retro graphics that bring old-school gaming nostalgia.</li>
<li>A strong “just-one-more-level” vibe and loads of explosive fun!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Native Linux version that was tested, two prominent bugs were found in the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos don't play and instead you get a white screen (the developer is aware).</li>
<li>In my case when pressing ESC to go to the menu, I was unable to exit the menu again unless I loaded the last save. That's quite game-breaking as you'll lose progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on those issues, I would recommend just playing it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> where those issues don't exist after testing with Proton 9.0-3. However, with Proton the Unreal Engine it uses brings up an additional step to install some bits it needs so you'll have to wait a minute or two for it to appear.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319390/Kvark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) is a sweet game about writing letters to real people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Expanding greatly from the original, Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) from Popcannibal is out now with Linux support. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, all you need are a few kind words to set your day off right or to cheer you up from a bad week. That's pretty much what Kind Words 2 is all about. You write and receive completely anonymous letters, all real people that are also playing it. The sequel is a far bit more than that though with you able to go out and explore a little, giving you more opportunities for letter writing. It includes everything from the original game (the letters are backwards compatible), remastered and available inside this one too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-Qzjz4wVfR0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc8bbb9067d2fa00b14585a919f25148.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-Qzjz4wVfR0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In this one there's also shops you can visit to change your look, write and share poems or listen to others, visit the forest to write chain-letters and more. It's just thoroughly sweet.</p>
<p>Calling it a game is perhaps doing it dirty, it's not a game in the sense that you <em>play</em> it, it acts more like an anonymous social network with a specific laser-focus of just being nice to everyone and getting some advice, or getting some handy tips and suggestions.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118120/Kind_Words_2_lofi_city_pop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>FEX-Emu version 2410 out bringing some important fixes for gaming on AArch64</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://fex-emu.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu</a> is an emulation layer that allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries (like games and apps) on an AArch64 Linux host, similar to qemu-user and box86/box64. Instead of using full disk images, FEX-Emu uses rootfs overlay + forwarding GL processing to the host to achieve better performance in emulated software.</p>
<p>Version 2410 was <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2410/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released this week</a> and the changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARM64EC changes:</strong> Fixed AVX bugs around state saving and restoring when running under Wine, and changes to dynamically determine Windows syscall numbers under WINE instead of hardcoding them. The call checker was also revamped fixing issues when applications hook function early using Wind32 APIs.</li>
<li><strong>JIT Optimizations</strong>: More optimized JIT code which result in 9% less CPU being spent in JIT'ing code. This is important because, the less time cpu is spent in JIT the less "choppy" the software being emulated will be.</li>
<li><strong>JIT fixes: </strong>Fixed bugs on the x87 instruction set that was offering a bugged <code class="inline-code">FPREM</code> instruction (although <code class="inline-code">FPREM1</code> was working and its also part of <code class="inline-code">x87</code>). One of the weird issues this caused was that Steam login was super weird and you had to repeat login multiple times to work. This also fixed bugs on <em>Touhou Luna Nights</em> and <em>Halls of Torment</em> games. <code class="inline-code">SSE MAXSS</code> instruction was also fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed changelog of changes can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/compare/FEX-2409...FEX-2410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed it there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been some leaks</a> that Valve may be preparing to use tools like FEX to get gaming working on ARM. So it's a project worth following to see the progress.</p>

      <title>Descent 3: Piccu Engine is a new open source build focused on quality-of-life improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to Descent 3 being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/descent-3-has-been-made-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">officially open source</a>, developers can do almost anything with it now and this has given rise to the <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/PiccuEngine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Descent 3: Piccu Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Forked from the open source Descent 3 game engine the Descent 3: Piccu Engine, it includes "almost every change from <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/InjectD3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InjectD3</a>, among many more". You might think, well why not submit to the original open source project? But this is the benefit of open source isn't it! People can do whatever changes they want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1397537761728463053gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Descent 3 from Steam</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This includes enhancements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Centered window mode.</li>
<li>Scaling in window and fullscreen mode.</li>
<li>Fullscreen which does not change desktop settings (multi adapter support forthcoming).</li>
<li>New mouse code.</li>
<li>Adjustable FOV, with automatic expansion for widescreen.</li>
<li>Missing features in OpenGL restored, including specular highlights and the ability to control mipmapping.</li>
<li>Cockpit actually works in widescreen, unlike InjectD3.</li>
<li>Faster iteration when many missions are present.</li>
<li>Smoother UI (FPS limit raised to 60).</li>
<li>OpenAL sound system with no crackling and environment reverb support.</li>
<li>Many bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently though according to the GitHub page this version of the code is only set up for Windows, but the developer hopes "to change this shortly".</p>
<p>You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed in the inbox of no return from last week. The next-generation SDL 3 is closing in on a proper stable release now with the SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview now available for game developers.</p>
<p>Despite the version number, it's still pre-release and not officially released just yet. What is SDL used for? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware on many different platforms like Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>In the release <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> developer Sam Lantinga (Valve) said: "We have lots of bugs to fix before the 3.2.0 stable release, but SDL 3.0 has been battle tested by millions of people in DOTA, CS2 and Steam, and is ready for your eyes!". Additionally developer Ryan Gordon <a href="https://x.com/icculus/status/1842311794817442015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Twitter / X: "I can't believe I finally get to say this. SDL3 is officially ABI locked! We will _add_ new things but not _change_ or _remove_ what's there, starting right now. Which means it's safe to start migrating your games to it, starting today!"</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/main/examples" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Example programs</a> to get you started, <a href="https://examples.libsdl.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">running in your web browser</a>!</li>
<li>More consistent API naming conventions. Everything is named consistently across the API now, instead of different subsystems taking different approaches. Also, we've tended toward more descriptive names for things in SDL3.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GPU API</a>: access to modern 3D rendering and GPU compute in a cross-platform way.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryDialog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dialog API</a>: access to system file dialogs (file and folder selection UI for opening/saving).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryFilesystem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Filesystem API</a>: simple directory management and globbing, access to topic-specific user folders.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryStorage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Storage API</a>: Abstract interface to platform-specific storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryCamera" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Camera API</a>: access to webcams.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryPen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pen API</a>: access to pens (like Wacom tablets and Apple Pencil, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_OpenAudioDevice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logical audio devices</a>: different parts of an app can get their own unique audio device to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Properties API</a>: fast, flexible dictionaries of name/value pairs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProcess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Process API</a>: Spawn child processes and communicate with them in various ways.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_Colorspace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Colorspace support</a>: Surfaces and the renderer, etc, can manage multiple colorspaces.</li>
<li>The Clipboard API <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetClipboardData" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can support any data type</a> (SDL2 only handled text), and apps can provide data in multiple formats upon request in <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_ClipboardDataCallback" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a provided callback</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/BestKeyboardPractices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Better keyboard input</a>, for all your keypress needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_StartTextInputWithProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Customizable virtual keyboards</a> on iOS and Android.</li>
<li>High DPI support is dramatically improved over SDL2.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetAppMetadata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">App metadata API</a> for letting SDL report things about your app correctly (like in the About dialog on macOS, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateRWLock" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read/write thread locks</a>, to let multiple threads access rarely-changing data in parallel.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_InitState" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Init State</a> to help with multiple threads that might need to initialize something on-demand without racing.</li>

      <title>Block Factory is basically a LEGO factory automation game with diorama building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen and likely played Factorio, Satisfactory and no doubt seen the chilled-out shapez 2 but there's a newcomer ready to suck your time away in Block Factory. This one is basically a LEGO block factory and automation sim, they just obviously can't use the LEGO name.</p>
<p><em>I've been played the demo on Kubuntu Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9</a> and it works beautifully.</em></p>
<p>Coming from OverPowered Team and publisher Shiro Unlimited there's a few things that will set this one apart from the likes of shapez 2, which is what it's most similar to for the much more relaxed atmosphere — just you and the factory and your many conveyor belts.</p>
<p>Here, not only are you extracting blocks but you also need to put them together <em>manually</em> in a little mini-building game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To make it clearer: you will set down piece dispensers to pull up blocks from resource nodes, and send them across the map on conveyors into various stacking machines. It's inside here, that you manually drag blocks around to arrange them. It can get complicated, since you will end up needing to do this across multiple stackers to end up with the exact shape needed at the end. So you'll stack certain blocks together, to then stack multiple of those together later into another shape.</p>
<p>Quite a brilliantly clever use of game mechanics here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then you have more like gluing blocks together on their sides, you may also need to cut certain blocks into different shapes to then combine or stick together later on. There's a <em>lot</em> of possibilities here, and based on the demo they're really doing some great stuff with the ideas.</p>
<p>Eventually on each map you build up a diorama too, so it gives you a fun little something to progress towards.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A6yGmc7HOsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e26522d317ff624d4c543203b1d418f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A6yGmc7HOsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think this one, if done right with enough content in the full game, it will end up being a big hit. Really enjoyed trying out the demo.</p>
<p>Worth a go check it out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827680/Block_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare come to PC on October 29</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally huh? They sure kept us waiting. Red Dead Redemption from Rockstar Games is now set for a PC launch on October 29.</p>
<p>Working together with Double Eleven the PC release will come enhanced with native 4K resolution at up to 144hz on compatible hardware, monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9), HDR10 support, and full keyboard and mouse functionality. It will also feature NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings and more.</p>
<p>It will also include Undead Nightmare plus bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition.</p>

<p>One still annoying thing about this release is that according to the Steam page it "Requires 3rd-Party Account: Rockstar Games". For a single-player game that's always a nuisance since there's no multiplayer content in this release.</p>
<p>It will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available from Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be buying it? Hopefully it will run well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>ZOOM Platform store announces new tool to run Windows games on Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news here. <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a>, a games store that offers DRM-free games both new and old (as well as helping update some older games) now offers a special tool for Linux gamers to run Windows games with Proton.</p>
<p>This new tool called <a href="https://zoom-platform.sh/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">zoom-platform.sh</a> was built to include "safety checks, handling updates, installing DLCs, creating desktop entries, a simple uninstaller" and more. It's based on top of the new Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-umu-gets-a-first-official-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a first release</a>, along with protonfixes to ensure everything works as well as possible.</p>
<p>How many games from ZOOM Platform will work with this new tool? They said "We tested our most popular games, and we submitted our own fixes for many of them; some work out of the box, and some may not work at all." - so pretty normal stuff for running Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>ZOOM Platform do offer actual Native Linux games too, but this gives you the best of both worlds. They also recently celebrated their 10th anniversary of the ZOOM Platform.</p>

      <title>Pairs &amp; Perils combines deck-building and dungeon-crawling with a card-matching memory game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've probably played card-matching memory games before, but have you played them in the setting of a dungeon-crawling deck-builder before? Pairs &amp; Perils has a fun idea.</p>
<p>Here you have to try and memorize all the cards on the table to match up weapons and characters to attack enemies, while avoiding damaging trap cards that will force you to skip a turn. There's enemies to battle who have a turn countdown until they attack, so you have to defeat them with card matching before you die.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18641006571728389691gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18641006571728389691gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After each turn you earn coins to go into the shop where you're able to buy up new special cards in the form of relics to have an effect all the time, plus cards you can consume for special effects during a battle. Thanks to this system there's plenty of ways to go through a run.</p>
<p>Various enemies you face have special abilities too and some of them can be quite annoying to get in the way of you matching your cards, or even destroying your prized relic that's been helping you push through a run. Overall a nice little twist on the deck-building dungeon-crawler idea that I'm keen to see more from as the demo is promising.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WWT3NXXbzSE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/029b85eb4eb87b283fa31f0279d1d5cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WWT3NXXbzSE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179860/Pairs__Perils/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> now with a Native Linux version. I played through it for a while today and it works great.</p>

      <title>Space Marine 2 fixes online for Steam Deck but may need launch option on desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Marine 2 recently broke online play on Linux / Steam Deck, but the latest update should solve it. Although it seems desktop Linux users will need a launch option.</p>
<p>The breakage came from the 3.0 patch which caused a AVF error to appear and stopping Linux / Steam Deck players from accessing any of the online features.</p>
<p>In the latest "Hotfix 3.1" there's these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4696782040358852369" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fixes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed heavy stutters on some CPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed launch issue on Linux and Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with dynamic resolution and ultrawide screens.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with upscalers using wrong resolution parameters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13977292441728386997gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>However, like we've seen from a few games over the last year, desktop Linux users have issues since the game appears to look for the Steam Deck specifically. To get around it you need to spoof your desktop Linux PC to appear as a Steam Deck with this Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>You can buy Space Marine 2 from:</p>

      <title>Gamescope gets improved ROG Ally support hinting at more progress for SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve previously confirmed</a> that they are indeed working towards a version of SteamOS (used on Steam Deck) for the ROG Ally / ROG Ally X, we're now seeing some of that get into <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>.</p>
<p>For those who don't know all the Linux lingo: Gamescope is micro-compositor, used by default on the Steam Deck (and can be used on desktop Linux) to manage the output of games in a way that's contained and then allow for many transformations on it like adjusting resolutions, FSR and NIS upscaling, fullscreen mode and more.</p>
<p>Just recently code was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/commit/b288a82a61005b91dd268b8ea4e8d124d4dd5267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merged</a> by a contributor (it's open source) into the project to allow for configuring the display on the ASUS ROG Ally and the newer ASUS ROG Ally X. From the notes on the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This introduces a display configuration for the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X handhelds. These devices feature the same 1920x1080p panel, which supports VRR and has a range limit of 48-120Hz in the EDID.</p>
<p>I tested this configuration on two separate units:<br/>
* ROG Ally - SteamOS Main 20240919.1002 with kernel 6.8.12-valve2-1<br/>
* ROG Ally X - SteamOS Main 20240919.1002 with kernel 6.11.2</p>
<p>Both function exactly the same throughout multiple games with the entire refresh rate slider within Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To set expectations: this doesn't mean a SteamOS build for the ROG Ally / X are due any time soon. It may still be a while away.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.2 released with improved Wayland colour management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team have today released the Plasma 6.2 desktop environment bringing with it a "friendlier, more accessible and smarter environment". <em>This is the same UI used on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode!</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from this release? Here's some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A whole lot of new features for users of drawing tablets.</li>
<li>More complete support for the Wayland colour management protocol enabled it by default.</li>
<li>Power management improvements like overriding applications that block sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17597198101728385360gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17597198101728385360gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - KDE Plasma 6.2</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overhauled accessibility options.</li>
<li>Various improvements to the look and feel of the UI.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes and various other smaller updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The once a year request for donations pop-up is also live as of this release.</em></p>
<p>I'm still currently on Plasma 5.27, so I'm really looking forward to the next Kubuntu release with 24.10 that will at least get me up to Plasma 6.1. One of the benefits of being just a bit behind is seeing all the new stuff get stable before moving over to it. I'm excited! The KDE team have been doing some stellar work.</p>
<p>What are you most happy to see in Plasma 6.2? Leave a comment and let me know!</p>

      <title>Creative Assembly confirm Alien: Isolation is getting a sequel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's truly hard to believe that Alien: Isolation is 10 years old now, and we're going to get a sequel to one of the scariest games ever made.</p>
<p>Alien: Isolation is a special one for me, since Aliens is one of my all-time favourite movies, and this perfectly expanded the universe while treating it with respect. Just…my heart didn't particularly like it. What an exceptional experience it was to play.</p>
<p>The day after its 10th anniversary (today), the official account on X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> a sequel is now in early development.

<p>It's hard to believe that it has been 10 years since we embarked on our journey with the release of ALIEN: ISOLATION™</p>
<p>When we started developing ALIEN: ISOLATION, we had one guiding principle: to create a truly authentic experience that went back to the roots of the ALIEN™ franchise - a new story capturing the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie masterpiece.</p>
<p>It's been nothing short of incredible to witness your passion for the game over the years and see it reach so many players around the world. Your boundless enthusiasm, excitement, screams (!) and steely courage in the face of cinema's greatest killer, have been profoundly rewarding.</p>
<p>Whether you're a nightmare mode veteran or stepping into Amanda Ripley's shoes for that thrilling first attempt (good luck!), we wanted to express our deep gratitude. It was a dream project brought to life by a brilliant team, and the reception you have given it over the years is extraordinary.</p>
<p>On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear.</p>
<p>Today, I'm delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to ALIEN: ISOLATION is in early development.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br/>
Al Hope, Creative Director - ALIEN: ISOLATION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original had Native Linux support from Feral Interactive, who no longer port games over to Linux, so it's likely you'll need Valve's Proton to play the sequel.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see what they come up with, and already terrified to think how it's going to feel to play through.</p>

      <title>Uncompromising wilderness survival game The Last Plague: Blight now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Original Studios just launched The Last Plague: Blight, an uncompromising wilderness survival game based on a more realistic set of game mechanics. It arrives with Native Linux support in Early Access. <em>Note: key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>For a game that's not finished, the initial impression I get from it is quite fantastic actually. Giving vibes of a mixture of Rust, Valheim and other similar games in a new and fresh setting that still somehow feels unique in a crowded genre.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YZXW5obTink"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a590df153c674dee3e32d22eac1a3b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YZXW5obTink" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One of the key points of this game is in the game, the dreaded Blight. It's a disease-ridden world, one where you will eventually try to find a cure. That's how the game sets you up too, you're not just randomly dropped into a world. You've escaped the Blight — for now, but you're on your own and you need to survive the wilderness with nothing but your bare hands to start with.</p>
<p>This is a game that, if you let it, will end up consuming you and your whole week. Everything in it takes time and it's surprisingly deep mechanically already. From smashing rocks together to make a bowl, to gathering and boiling water so it's safe and actually getting a roof over your head just surviving is a constant battle. Surprisingly a little bit on the scary side too, when you're wandering through the forest trying to reach water and a bunch of Coyotes run in the distance when all you've got a small hatched and a bowl to your name.</p>
<p>Thankfully there's a full tutorial to guide you through all the basics steps of getting stuff done, and even the tutorial will take you a good while to get through. The UI is also thankfully rather well thought-out too, all parts of it just seem to make sense to the point that I so far haven't been confused even a single time. Same can't be said for my sense of direction though, but that's also been thought about with you able to craft markers to help you. There's also a reasonable map system too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Even though there's plenty to it already the developer has big plans to keep expanding it including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Continuation of the story and tying in an actual long-term goal to the game.</li>
<li>Collaboration and trading with other NPC survivors to rebuild.</li>
<li>Fishing.</li>
<li>Character customization including gender.</li>
<li>Injury and wound system.</li>
<li>Controller support.</li>
<li>Taming animals.</li>
<li>More localized languages (French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, German, Italian and possibly more).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance is surprisingly great too. Testing it on my Kubuntu Linux desktop with an AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon RX 6800 XT on the Very High preset at 2560x1440 has been really smooth and always well above 60FPS.</p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access I'll be keeping a keen eye on this and keep checking back on it. If you're in need of a new game to get hooked on and get in deep this is a great choice right now. Great atmosphere, great game mechanics and really interesting to play. This has all the makings to be a huge hit and I'm already hooked on it.</p>
<p>Considering it's only £14.29 when not on sale, that's a fantastic price for what's there too - good value. It may go up in price once it leaves Early Access. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Nazi Zombies: Portable is a free and open source Call of Duty: Zombies demake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this one before! A few developers have been building Nazi Zombies: Portable, a Call of Duty: Zombies demake powered by various enhanced forks of the Quake engine. What's a demake? It's basically remaking another game in an older style.</p>
<p>The developer explains: "The game itself is feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented with minor parity differences. Most World at War maps and their unique features are not yet represented. Various small additions and changes from Call of Duty: Black Ops are present as a means of gameplay smoothing, but not on a wide scale. NZ:P is, first and foremost, a Call of Duty: World at War remake."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1380712591728300172gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1380712591728300172gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nazi Zombies: Portable on Linux</em></p>
<p>If you've not played Call of Duty Zombies and have no idea what is going on: in simple terms it's a Zombie survival wave-shooter mode. You start off with a simple handgun, and gradually gain money from taking down the walkers to buy up new weapons and access new areas. I tried it out for a bit today and it feels pretty good actually, they really nailed the vibe of it and the mechanics.</p>
<p>Fun to see such a project exist. And perhaps with a little GamingOnLinux shout-out it can find a new audience, and who knows maybe some development help. Would love to see this one keep expanding.</p>

      <title>Ridiculous physics platformer Mosa Lina added co-op, game rebuilt to be native</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mosa Lina is a really fantastic game. It's also completely insanely ridiculous, full of chaos and now you can bring a friend along for the ride. It has Native Linux support and is <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? The developers say it's a "Hostile Interpretaion of immersive sim design". Basically, it's a challenging platformer with a whole lot of ridiculous physics going on. It's super random in the design, the developer explained how it's a "response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EbverJLQy_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb46c10d085434f1bf429bf1bc7b636.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EbverJLQy_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an update launched in September that I missed called The Collaboration Update they basically re-built the game so it's no longer using web browser tech to run the game, with it being fully native now. The benefit is that it runs much faster, it's smaller and many other improvements.</p>
<p>Also there's now full 2 player co-op in the game with local and online support. This co-op mode works with all existing modes and custom levels, plus there's two new co-op exclusive gameplay modifiers.</p>
<p>However, their recording system was removed, as they believe Steam Recording will be better. See all the improvements in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477090/view/4607834045442857504" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>As of the latest update released September 30th it's been Steam Deck Verified, and the developers hooked up full controller support making it more accessible than ever. It also has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB so it's nicely playable with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Linux platforms.</p>

– The game now natively supports controller play on PC and Steam Deck.<br/>
– You may now use the mouse-wheel to scroll while mousing over menus and text fields.<br/>
– The game’s playability on Steam Deck has been vastly improved.<br/>
– You can now use the move-buttons / left joystick to deploy party members in the pre-combat party placement state (until now you’ve had to use the mouse).<br/>
– Pressing the “Swap Character” button (‘Q’ / RIGHT BUMPER) in combat, cycles through available targets.<br/>
– Character level cap is raised to 25.<br/>
– Certain enemies in the late game will now scale past level 20 making the end-game slightly more difficult.<br/>
– Added new Bard class. This includes a new school of spells..<br/>
– Added new Backgrounds: Entertainer, Laborer, Monastic, Nomad, Snake-Cultist.<br/>
– Fixed a bug where Horryn Guards roam around after you retake the city.</p>

      <title>Halo will now be built on Unreal Engine 5, 343 Industries rebrands to Halo Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of game industry news for you: in a pretty big win for Epic Games and their Unreal Engine, 343 Industries rebrands to Halo Studios and said the future of Halo will be built on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries. Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of how we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.” — Pierre Hintze, Studio Head</p>
<p>They confirmed that they're working on "multiple projects" so we can expect a whole lot more Halo to come. Hopefully they will work well enough on Linux platforms with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Part of this is building Project Foundry, which is a research project for the studio to see what's required to build a Halo game in Unreal Engine and makes it a training tool for them. You can see more from that in the video below.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For any of you who work with image editing on Linux for any reason, you've probably used the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) at some point, well it's getting really close to the long-awaited 3.0 release now. <em>It's a tool I use every day for GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Announced in a development <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/10/05/development-update/#non-destructive-editing-updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the team noted they're about 96% of the way there towards the first Release Candidate, after development slowed over the summer due to a few developers falling ill after the Libre Graphics Meeting conference.</p>

<em>Pictured - GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</em></p>
<p>Quite a lot to look forward to from this upcoming release including expanded non-destructive editing, upgrades to the API for plug-ins, work towards enabling letting you easily export an image into several different sizes leaving the original untouched, colour space work, darktable integration improvements for RAW images, upgrading the documentation, lots of bug fixes and so on.</p>

      <title>Grounded no longer needs a Microsoft Account for multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Sony are actively making their PC ports worse with forced PlayStation Network accounts even for single-player games, some companies choose to make them better and now Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios gets improved.</p>
<p>Grounded was updated at the end of September to remove the forced Microsoft Account sign-in to play multiplayer on PC, as it's now Steam Native. Nice to see! We saw a similar thing with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/it-takes-two-now-steam-deck-verified-ea-app-launcher-no-longer-required/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It Takes Two removing the EA app requirement</a>. Hope to see more like this, because it's thoroughly annoying to launch one game and end up with another sign-in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5922073391728292925gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/962130/view/4664130308822453256" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Native Support</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam players no longer require a Microsoft Account to play multiplayer
<ul>
<li>While not logged into a Microsoft Account, you can host and join standard world multiplayer sessions with players from your Steam friends list</li>
<li>Note: a Microsoft Account is still required for Crossplay, Shared Worlds and Playgrounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Crossplay Toggle in the Main Menu to quickly switch between a “Crossplay State” and a “Steam Native State”
<ul>
<li>Friends will need to be in the same “State” to see and join each other online</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players can now unlink their Microsoft Account from their Steam Account
<ul>
<li>Navigate by going to Options - Game Tab - At the bottom you will see “Unlink Microsoft Account”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Grounded is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

<p>If those interest you then <a href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/y2GbLb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Humble Bundle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Humble have this month <em>closed</em> their built-in partner program and moved over to the <em>much</em> less generous third-party service called Impact. So our links have changed, and we get <em>far</em> less now too. Remember that <a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a> is the best way to support GamingOnLinux (and now more than ever!).</p>
<p>Additionally, Humble seem to now be including Deck Verified status and info pulled from ProtonDB on the bundle. Although they're conflating ProtonDB status with how a game will run on Steam Deck, like for The Last Stand: Aftermath they say underneath it has "ProtonDB Platinum Deck Support" despite Valve listing it as Unsupported (since ProtonDB covers desktop Linux too). Nice to see they're trying though.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for SteamVR, Game Recording and Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Steam Client Beta release is live for October 4th that includes a bunch of quick bug fixes for desktop and Steam Deck. Since it's a normal Client (the Steam App) Beta update, it's the same for Steam Deck and desktop.</p>
<p>Here's all the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659627343423606990?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam not being able to connect to SteamVR with error "SteamVR Failed to initialize: VR API not loaded (101)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from October 2nd's beta client which was causing some recordings to incorrectly fall back to using the CPU to encode video while playing a game, resulting in an increase in CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing exporting a clip to file, clipboard or chat to fail or sometimes crash.</li>
<li>Fixes some cases where the clip export dialog did not appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from the October 2nd Beta Update which caused per-controller preferences to not get loaded in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing some games to be repeatedly restarted after launching.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We're probably not far off having the Game Recording feature roll out to the stable client now. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-families-has-officially-launched-with-a-big-steam-client-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Families was officially launched in September</a>, this is the next big one coming.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a particular bug lately you want to see solved?</p>

      <title>JRPG-inspired adventure Flowstone Saga with a puzzle-battle system is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Impact Gameworks who made the excellent Tangledeep, their next game Flowstone Saga is officially out now with Linux support. <em>Note: my key was provided by NOVY UNLIMITED PR.</em></p>
<p>Given how much I enjoyed Tangledeep, I was keen to see what Impact Gameworks had up their sleeve next. It started off life as Puzzle Explorers: A Tangledeep Story which had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/07/puzzle-explorers-a-tangledeep-story-announced-and-now-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed crowdfunding campaign</a>, then it came back <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/flowstone-saga-is-an-upcoming-jrpg-inspired-adventure-from-the-dev-of-tangledeep/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of a year later</a> renamed to Flowstone Saga and it was a success this time around. Nice to see that when you have a good idea, sometimes you just need a little more time to get everything right.</p>
<p>Fusing together the basic idea of Tetris and a JRPG-styled adventure, with an intriguing story and some nice pixel art Flowstone Saga really hits a lot of the right notes. It pulls you in right from the start, even the first 5 minutes has you battling away as it teaches you the basics of the falling-blocks battle system and you just want <em>more</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The battle system basics are: drop the blocks to get a full horizontal line, which then gets destroyed and you'll attack the enemy. You start off with basic shapes, with more types of shapes to unlock as you go. It throws in lots extras as well with different types of special blocks you can line up and destroy for more damage, that make it feel just that bit more frantic.</p>
<p>Like a true classic RPG, you can fight multiple people in one battle, and switch targets any time while dropping blocks. You will need to do this at times too, as enemies can charge up special attacks, so this again adds to the additional heart-pounding moments when you really need those damn blocks to line up nicely. On top of that, enemies can throw stuff onto the board you need to clear, as they have harmful effects and become a nuisance. The design of it is mechanically just <em>great</em>. I'm not even particularly a Tetris fan at all, but here it fits in so perfectly that it's just plain fun.</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P1ZIUS2DzEc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66c6968680fd0c66934fb896992aee9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P1ZIUS2DzEc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's even more to it, since it's an RPG, you have a level system. Here, you can earn special perks which can directly affect the block-dropping board. You could select to have some blocks pre-filled for example, with more filled at higher levels or put your unlocks into power perks when you hit enemies harder. There's multiple ways to play.</p>
<p>As you explore there's various places that need re-building, and here you do little puzzles instead of battles with the falling blocks. They're optional, but a nice way to help towards upgrades and just a fun little break from the rest of the game. Just a nice little extra added in for explorers and completionists.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to the story, it's thoroughly intriguing too and will keep you guessing for a while. You do learn early on <em>how</em> you do the block-dropping, and <em>where</em> the power specifically for you comes from but it's still quite mysterious on where it originallyy came from to keep you wanting to progress further and explore more of the carefully designed world. Nice bit of town-building outside all the battling too, giving you more of a sense of purpose. And, in true retro-RPG fashion, you can run into everyone's house and open their chest for some extras - has no one ever heard of a lock?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous pixel art with painstakingly handcrafted areas sprawling across multiple biomes.</li>
<li>An epic story grand in scope, but with plenty of heart and charm.</li>
<li>Designed with accessibility in mind – including multiple difficulty options and a turn-based “Hold” mode.</li>
<li>Improve, expand, and decorate the hub town of New Riverstone – helping its citizens and making it your own.</li>
<li>Mini-games with unique and quirky ways to play … and profit!</li>
<li>In co-op assist mode, join the fight with a friend in battle.</li>
<li>Lots of ways to create unique battle strategies and express yourself: equipment customization, perk trees, job system, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One nice touch is that before you even get to the main menu, you're given screen display settings so you can get it how you want it first. More games should do that.</p>
<p>There were a few issues with it at release across Linux / Steam Deck, but the developer has solved them before publishing this so you're good to go with the Native Linux version. Works really nicely.</p>
<p>If you long for the days of sweet-looking 16-bit styled JRPGs, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one. Everything from the art style, to the design of the music and sound effects really reminded me of the golden age of such games years ago. The battle mechanic really adds to the experience too. Absolutely worth grabbing without a second thought needed. Flowstone Saga made me, <em>surprisingly</em>, finally truly appreciate dropping-blocks.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372000/Flowstone_Saga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. And at some point on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/flowstone_saga" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a wonderful reinvention of what Pinball can be</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a few attempts to update Pinball into something new, and Pinball Spire is the latest that's out now. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. <em>Note: my key was sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>It's being called a pinballvania, because it takes some ideas from metroidvanias to provide a rather different experience for pinball fans and turns it into much more of an adventure. Developed by Apparition Games, a tiny indie game studio in Canada. What you get here is a rather unique blend of pinball, platforming and puzzles to make something quirky and different to spend your time with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16792888961728051836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16792888961728051836gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Pinball Spire on Linux</em></p>
<p>What makes it quite different is that each main level in the game acts as a self-contained puzzle for you to solve, with the power of pinball. I'll be honest, pinball is a game I never really got. Like many others though, I did play plenty of Space Cadet in the early Windows days but other than that it never really appealed to me. However, Pinball Spire thankfully understands me and shows me there's another way to do it, one that's just far more exciting and mysterious.</p>
<p>Here you go into each new room not really knowing what to expect from it, and there's quite a lot of surprising variety in how you'll be dealing with each section. Thankfully, you've got a special scouter that you can hit a button to pause the movement at any time to look around and hover over objects to learn more, and hopefully get an idea on how to beat the room.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o4eVLrlq634"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de5a19e810f264c9cc632e385d6cc6e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o4eVLrlq634" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's definitely a little frustration that can be found though. Some parts of it seemed to take me forever, because I just couldn't hit a very specific spot. Other times you're left just waiting for the ball to drop, which can take a while in some cases. Basically, it has all the annoying bits of Pinball too, as well as all the exciting new additions to make it (to me) actually worth a go.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you're not just any old pinball, you have special abilities! Like being able to slow down time to line up a perfect shot (still not easy), but it gives you an actual shot line when you use the slow ability if the ball is over a flipper so you know exactly where it will fire. Seriously though, there's a few times I got worried I was smashing the keys on my keyboard a little <em>too</em> hard when desperately wanting to make a shot. Using these abilities takes up mana too, so you can't just use them all the time, which adds to the challenge of it all.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to the world of Pinballvania! A fusion of arcade pinball mechanics with platforming, puzzles, and exploration—drawing inspiration from retro action-adventure games</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Fun accessories to collect and equip to customize Pip’s appearance!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the launch of Pinball Spire, solo developer Tom Voros said: "I hope players enjoy the atmospheric art and music as they journey through the Pinball Spire in this unconventional take on pinball action!".</p>
<p>It's a really unique experience not to be missed. Fantastic design and great audio to go with it make it a really fun game overall.</p>

      <title>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) gets a first official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) from Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider version 1.1.1 is out now as the first official release to help improve Linux desktop and Steam Deck gaming.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: despite the name, it's not a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run outside of Steam.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First official release of UMU launcher!</p>
<ul>
<li>Should work inside both flatpak and snap</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have official builds for flatpak or snap yet, but instructions are provided on building and using for both:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak</a><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does it actually mean? It means that any app can run games using Proton just like they would from inside Steam so you can get a good experience with Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck from Epic Games, GOG, Amazon and various other stores via apps like Heroic, Lutris and others (when they add in full support for UMU).</p>
<p>This is all part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, and so all apps will end up using the same online database of game-specific fixes that some games need to run properly via protonfixes. In short: better compatibility overall for gaming — eventually.</p>

      <title>6 years after Kickstarter, Orphan Age dev Studio Black Flag shuts without a release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game development is a complicated beast, a constant challenge to get funding and for Studio Black Flag who were building the promising looking Orphan Age it's all over. A game I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/dystopian-life-sim-orphan-age-should-be-on-linux-currently-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2018</a> with their Kickstarter, when the developer was confident on it having Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/767660/view/4679893541742798755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer put it very bluntly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dropping the nautical jargon for clarity, the last few months we’ve been going through bankruptcy procedures in France. This started when communication broke down between us and our publisher, leading to payments not continuing. Alas, with our publisher not continuing funding and no other sources of continued funding to finalize the game, the French government has elected to shut down the studio effective immediately. (Like at the end of the work day today we cannot legally continue working.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the date, they shut as of October 2nd.</p>
<p>To make matters worse when going through the Kickstarter they originally stressed how they "tried to work with publishers, but we never found a compromise that respected Orphan Age's DNA". Clearly they found one, but this is where it gets messier. In the FAQ at the bottom of the announcement it seems their publishing agreement handed over all of the rights of the game noting "I’m not able to get into the specifics of our contract with our publisher, but we simply do not have ownership over Orphan Age in a way that would allow us to shop it to another publisher.".</p>
<p>It might not be the complete end for the game since the publisher <em>could</em> continue it but it's now entirely out of the hands of Studio Black Flag.</p>
<p>Brutal, but a reminder that there's a lot of <em>bad</em> publisher contracts out there, where like this you hand over all your rights just to get the money. The developer has not named the publisher involved.</p>
<p>It's <em>also</em> a reminder that a lot of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding campaigns aren't nearly enough for a developer to fund a full game. Which is why a lot of them also end up with a publisher.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud gets a tutorial Beta and the price goes up soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud is easily (and I keep saying this) one of the best roguelikes ever made, and with the latest Beta it's a lot easier to get into. You might also want to buy it soon before the price rises.</p>
<p>They're making the final preparations for the 1.0 release to leave Early Access later this year and on October 29th the price will be jumping up to $29.99 USD (it's currently $19.99). So now really is a good time to buy it, especially with the latest Beta release.</p>
<p>Writing in an update on Steam they said: "We just released the Caves of Qud tutorial on our beta branch. It’s designed to teach the very basics of Caves of Qud and ends with your character arriving in Joppa, just like in a standard game. If you’re already a seasoned Qud player, you’ll likely be familiar with most of what gets taught (though there may be some useful nuggets for you); if you have a friend who’s been itching to try the game, this is a great opportunity to get them going!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2c6burNvtsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd58887074390f4c94399bd41f6b179.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2c6burNvtsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tutorial Beta is opt-in on Steam and a separate download on itch.io. Unclear if the Beta is on GOG.</p>
<p>The tutorial along with the last segment of the main story will come into the main branch when 1.0 releases. Which there's no date for just yet. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.17 Beta released with another quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bigger Steam Beta Client recently</a> that had some nice improvements for Game Recording, and various Linux fixes along with another SteamOS Beta - we have yet another tiny SteamOS update.</p>
<p>Valve are really pushing towards the stable release of SteamOS 3.6 for Steam Deck now!</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.6.17 "End of the End of the Line" Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4674264042203547171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wireless</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem where Steam Deck would be unable to connect to certain Wi-Fi 7 access points</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the Beta naming, Valve were likely hoping the <em>previous</em> Beta was the final one. Hopefully this one then. Who knows, maybe they'll treat us to SteamOS 3.6 stable later today, since Valve do have a habit of releasing things on Friday.</p>
<p>To access the current Beta you need to be in the Beta or Preview channel via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII gets Windows system requirements with Linux and macOS details later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games and 2K have released the system requirements for Sid Meier's Civilization VII on Windows, but the Linux and macOS requirements will be coming later.</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention, Sid Meier's Civilization VII coming to Linux officially shouldn't be news since I've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered it</a> now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-february-11-2025-gameplay-reveal-trailer-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple times</a>. But it's a nice reminder for people who missed that.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed</a> off the requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What's this? Only 20GB? You mean big new games don't have to be 100s of GBs? I am shocked.</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841885325528043648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> Firaxis additionally said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also releasing Civilization VII for MacOS and Linux / SteamOS. However, we don't have specs to share for those platforms at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did email them previously to try and find out who is doing the Linux version, but they did not reply. Usually it's Aspyr Media, but they're not listed anywhere this time around so it might be done directly by Firaxis.</p>
<p>The Windows version will have Denuvo Anti-tamper, which doesn't actually have Linux support, so it's likely again the Linux version will not have Denuvo. Additionally, there's no launcher this time around but the game does require a 2K Account for online interactions (but not for offline play).</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV to get an Expansion Pass, plus Gotterdammerung DLC releases November 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that Hearts of Iron IV is getting a big new expansion in Götterdämmerung on November 14th, and they're bringing the whole Expansion Pass idea from other games to Hearts of Iron IV as well.</p>
<p>For the new Expansion Pass you get a 20% overall discount versus buying individually and the first pass will give you all of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant unlock of three new 3d tank models and a music track.</li>
<li>The Götterdämmerung expansion (Nov 14th 2024).</li>
<li>The Graveyard of Empires country pack (Q1 2025).</li>
<li>Prototype Vehicles unit pack (Q3 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for Götterdämmerung itself it's very much focused on Germany, which Paradox said is "something many of you have been clamouring for for many years". Sounds like a great addition to the game with a super-weapons feature and so this expansion is also giving you some new special tools. As Paradox developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>War drives all sorts of technological innovation in an attempt to out-do opponents and although many projects ultimately never saw the battlefield, Götterdämmerung aims to tie together existing research systems with a new experimental research mechanic that allows for both historical and less historical but plausible super-projects to be pursued. The research process will become an important part of gameplay, with scientists, map-located experimental facilities, and supporting infrastructure all combining to produce a wide variety of outcomes that can augment your forces or change the very nature of the war you are fighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Based on regular player numbers, this seems to be the currently most popular grand strategy game from Paradox.</p>

      <title>Monty Pythonesque humour fused with Renaissance art comes in Death of the Reprobate on November 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer Joe Richardson is bringing on another brilliantly funny fusion of Monty Pythonesque humour with artwork styled like moving Renaissance paintings in Death of the Reprobate. This is their third game in this style following on from Four Last Things in 2017 and The Procession to Calvary from 2020.</p>
<p>It's a standalone game, technically, so you don't need to have played or know anything from the previous games but it does continue the overall story of Immortal John.</p>
<p>More about it: "In stark defiance of his name, Immortal John is dying. His heir, 'Malcolm the Shit', graciously takes a break from ordering cruel and unusual executions to visit the dying man and seek his inheritance - I mean, fulfill his final wishes. Unfortunately for Malcolm, the promised title and riches will only be awarded if he completes seven good deeds before sundown. Guided by the Lord God Almighty (quite literally - if you’re stuck, He’s the one holding a big arrow), the player must set forth into a surreal world of real Renaissance paintings and help a host of preposterous characters in order to earn Malcolm his inheritance."</p>
<p>Announced today it's going to release with Linux support on November 7th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3ql6wnJwT8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7876ae2529ab7acb293fc2ccfdf72ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3ql6wnJwT8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork – Renaissance, Rococo and even a hint of Romanticism, to be a little more precise. Hundreds of paintings, spanning hundreds of years, are all brought together into one consistent world.</li>
<li>Classical Music – Music by Eduardo Antonello. Period appropriate music that adapts as the story progresses, recorded using real medieval/renaissance instruments.</li>
<li>Standalone Story – Death of the Reprobate is set in the same world as Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary, and features some recurring characters/themes, but it can be played independently.</li>
<li>Highbrow Buffoonery – Lofty subject matter is treated with gleeful flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about it, the developer Joe Richardson said: "I burnt myself the fuck out six months ago but the game wasn't done so I kept going and now I feel genuinely unwell lol I HOPE YOU LIKE IT!"</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739900/Death_of_the_Reprobate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>More info on the Valve (Steam) collab with Arch Linux and potential future hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the big news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-steam-begin-a-direct-collaboration-with-arch-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve (Steam) began a collaboration with Arch Linux</a>, to help fund two very specific parts of the Linux distribution. Now, we have a bit more info on what it means.</p>
<p>After an interview recently from the A1RM4X YouTube channel with an Arch Linux developer, Antiz, they took to Reddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lpne5p0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explain</a> things a little bit further to help people understand what's happening. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, the way packages are currently built / managed still requires a few manual interventions from Package Maintainers (e.g. triggering the build itself and signing the built packages afterwards). As of now, supporting multiple architectures would mean multiplying those manual steps by the number of supported / targeted architectures. With the current number of packages compared to the current number of (volunteers) Package Maintainers maintaining them, Arch is not able to handle the extra amount of effort that it would imply.</p>
<p>A central build service and a central secure signing enclave (the two projects concerned by that Valve "sponsoring") would streamline the overall process by allowing automated build and signing for packages without requiring any manual steps / interventions from Package Maintainers anymore (and it will also allow to increase the security of the process as a side benefit). Only such a streamlined / automated workflow would allow us to start working on supporting multiple architectures without implying to multiply the current amount of required effort.</p>
<p>In other words, those projects are prerequisites to start working on multiple architectures support in a clean &amp; sane way, which is a end goal shared by both Arch and Valve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically, a lot of it is towards supporting multiple architectures. And with the news that Valve are seemingly working on supporting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some form of Arm and Android support</a> (likely for a future VR headset), this definitely makes sense. Especially when Valve already use Arch Linux for SteamOS on the Steam Deck, it seems increasingly likely that Valve will use an Arch Linux base for what comes next.</p>
<p>Antiz has also been replying to other comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lps1xud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, in one post noting that it is very much their "end goal" for Arch Linux to support multiple architectures.</p>
<p>Check out the full interview on the A1RM4X YouTube channel with the Arch Linux developer Antiz:</p>

      <title>XR glasses on Linux / Steam Deck get vastly better with the XR Gaming Plugin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Wayne Heaney has been working to make XR glasses on Linux / Steam Deck a much better experience, and their latest release of the XR Gaming Plugin sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Heaney has been working on the <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/XRLinuxDriver" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XR Linux Driver</a> for Linux devices (including the Steam Deck) to automatically recognize supported XR glasses, <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breezy Desktop</a> a collection of tools to enable virtual desktop environments for gaming and productivity (desktop Linux) and the Decky Loader <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XR Gaming Plugin</a> to bring easy controls <em>directly</em> in Steam Deck's Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>This includes support for popular XR glasses from VITURE, TCL/RayNeo, Rokid and XREAL.</p>
<p>As they said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fq0rt3/xr_on_steam_deck_just_got_way_better/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> the new 1.0 XR Gaming Plugin brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Display</strong> mode - "pin" your game so it doesn't follow your head movements. Enable <strong>Side-by-side</strong> so the display can be pulled in closer (like a real monitor) or moved further away to reduce eye strain or play games that support 3D side-by-side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VR-Lite</strong> mode - head tracking in first and third-person games creates a VR-like experience for non-VR games (doesn't require SteamVR, etc...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow</strong> mode - Resize and reposition the display, put it in the corner of your display or just make it smaller so it's easier to see the edges. Enable <strong>Smooth follow</strong> so the screen glides to follow you and smoothes out bumps and jerks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual display and smooth follow modes give you the ability to <strong>zoom-in</strong> for a more IMAX-like experience (this crops the display, but you can use head movements to look to the edges) or enable a <strong>curved display</strong> that wraps around you for easier viewing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've used the plugin before, the biggest improvement is that the Virtual Display and Follow effects apply across <strong>everything in Game Mode</strong>: Steam OS views like Home and Library, all games, streaming apps like Chiaki and Moonlight, even apps like Firefox</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it requires the latest SteamOS 3.6 Beta.</p>
<p>See their video talking about the update below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z8ROMQagjgE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11f97beb4e7f619dd1e3c5ae52c6ad96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z8ROMQagjgE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of their future plans include native KDE support for Breezy Desktop, Multi-monitor support for Breezy Desktop for productivity on GNOME, Monado integration and more.</p>

      <title>DOOM ported to run almost entirely on AMD GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whatever will they do with DOOM next? A developer at AMD decided to port over classic DOOM to run almost entirely on the GPU. Why? In their own words "Because I can".</p>
<p>From the doomgpu <a href="https://github.com/jhuber6/doomgeneric/tree/master" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a port of DOOM that runs (almost) entirely on the GPU using the <a href="https://libc.llvm.org/gpu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LLVM C library for GPUs</a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doomgeneric</a> interface.</p>
<p>To try it you will need a WAD file (game data). If you don't own the game, shareware version is freely available (doom1.wad).</p>
<p>This implementation works on NVIDIA as well as AMDGPU. To use the NVIDIA implementation perform the same steps but with the <code class="inline-code">nvptx</code> loader and make target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6070146121727947637gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6070146121727947637gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We've seen DOOM run on basically everything, so why not just a GPU? According to the GitHub page it currently requires a Linux system, an AMDGPU with ROCm support, SDL2 libraries, a ROCm or ROCR-Runtime installation and an LLVM build off of the main branch (LLVM20 as of writing).</p>
<p>How they did it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code class="inline-code">clang</code> compiler can target GPUs directly. We emit a single kernel that calls the 'main' function. Functions that require the operating system are handled through the RPC interface. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLGc48GYHc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my LLVM talk</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This implementation defines the <code class="inline-code">amdgpu-loader</code> utility, which handles launching the <code class="inline-code">main</code> kernel, setting up the SDL2 window interface, and provides functions to get the input keys and write the output framebuffer. Okay, it's not <em>entirely</em> on the GPU, but all the logic and rendering runs on the GPU.</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 update The Armory released with weapon charms</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest major update to Counter-Strike 2 that brings with it more than 100 new items including weapon charms. These charms are quite popular in other shooters, so it's not a big surprise to see Valve add them in. Plus, it's yet another cosmetic item for Valve to basically print money with.</p>
<p>This brings with it a new battle pass system, which Valve call an Armory Pass. Although they work more a like a ticket, and you can have up to five of them active at a time. Each Armory Pass costs £12.79 so they're certainly not cheap and they each give a total of 40 credits. All the new stuff is gated behind this system too, so you have to buy a pass (or five) and then actually play to earn Armory Credits to then redeem for the items.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20818164661727946423gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20818164661727946423gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new weapon charms look quite nice, and you can place them anywhere on your weapons too.</p>
<p>In true Valve style, it's all random too. You can select a specific category of items to spend your credits, and then pay up to receive a random item from the collection. Obviously this is to get you to pay <em>and</em> play more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11104623031727946626gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11104623031727946626gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also made some changes to inventory items, placing a 7 day re-trade and re-market restriction on everything no matter how you got them. That includes the in-game store (including the Armory), Trade Offers and Steam Community Market.</p>
<p>There's also some network improvements, animation improvements and various bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets big Game Recording improvements, plus Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.16 Beta out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh Steam Client Beta for all platforms with some big Game Recording improvements, plus there's also another small Steam Deck SteamOS Beta update.</p>
<p>First up the Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.16 "End of the Line" Beta has this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4674264042200389436?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one note</a> "Fixed a system crash when hotplugging a second display in Desktop mode".</p>
<p>A Steam Client Beta was also released, with these <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4674263407967028563?snr=2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> specific to the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games stored on an external drive still showing as available when the drive is removed.</li>
<li>Make the enter action on the login password entry attempt to login rather than requiring navigation to the "submit" button.</li>
<li>Improve compatibility for native titles that have not been reviewed yet by launching them in the same runtime environment as reviewed titles.</li>
<li>Added a setting to record microphone input alongside gameplay audio.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the main Steam Client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659626709189608599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 126.0.6478.183</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for recording with the H.265 (HEVC) video codec when supported by the machine's GPU. This is enabled by default on Windows and should provide improved recording video quality over H.264 at the same file size. Coming soon to Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for recording up to 4k video resolution when using H.265 (HEVC).</li>
<li>Added a new "auto" quality setting that will set the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution. This will raise the bit rate when recording games running in 4k, to keep the recorded video sharp, and lower the resolution when running a game at 1080p to save disk space. This setting is on by default for all users.</li>
<li>Added support for recording ultrawide monitors up to 32:9 aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Added a setting to limit the width &amp; height of recorded video.</li>
<li>Exporting a recording (to file, clipboard or chat) will now use the machine's GPU to perform encoding and decoding when available.</li>
<li>Generating screenshots from recordings will now use the machine's GPU when available.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where exporting a recording could fail.</li>
<li>Added export settings dialog to allow custom file size or other settings when exporting a clip.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the media manager when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>Added video previews to the Background Recording items in the app details page's screenshot section when hovering them with a mouse or focusing them in BPM.</li>
<li>In per-game settings, add the ability to record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit.</li>
<li>Integrated the list of games where recording is disabled into the per-game settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash occurring when querying community controller configurations in the configurator.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for AV1 video streaming on high end systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash in some games using D3D9.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This version of the Steam client will no longer run on Windows 7 or Windows 8. Users on these OS versions will automatically be opted out of the beta. See <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</li>
<li>Improved detection of other computers for streaming and peer downloading when using a secondary wireless interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This version of the Steam client will no longer run on macOS 10.13 or 10.14. Users on these OS versions will automatically be opted out of the beta. See <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/743F-2E0E-C9A5-C375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed some parts of the in-game overlay ignoring clicks when the Game Recording timeline is visible.</li>
<li>Fixed slow startup on systems where the reverse hostname lookup for the loopback interface is not localhost.</li>
<li>Detecting and passing commands to an already running Steam client is significantly faster.</li>
<li>Added a -disable-screensaver-inhibit command line option to prevent Steam from inhibiting the screen saver when activity is detected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully it won't take Valve too long to hook up H.265 (HEVC) on Linux, sounds great. Nice to see continued Linux improvements overall too!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update October 4th:</strong> the Steam Client Beta was updated and re-released with this fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:</p>

      <title>From November 15, all Steam games sold in Germany will need an Age Rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/all-older-games-being-sold-in-germany-on-steam-now-require-a-content-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earlier in 2024</a>, Valve announced that games being sold in Germany were going to require an Age Rating to continue to be sold, and now there's a deadline.</p>
<p>An update was posted to Valve's official Steamworks <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey/germany" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentation</a> (thanks <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@SteamDB/113236564734679281" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>), that now makes it clear that game developers have a deadline of November 15th 2024 to ensure an Age Rating is provided. If one is missing, from that date the games simply won't be displayed to Steam customers in Germany.</p>
<p>Developers will need to "truthfully complete Steam's built-in content questionnaire and publish the results". Thankfully Valve has a built-in system for this, so it shouldn't take long for developers to do.</p>
<p>From Valve's FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q. When do I need to complete this questionnaire by?</strong><br/>
A. You can complete the questionnaire at any time. Games without a German age rating will be hidden from customers in Germany starting November 15, 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q. If I fill out the questionnaire, is my game guaranteed to remain available in Germany?</strong><br/>
A. No. There are certain kinds of content that are not allowed for sale to customers in Germany. If present in your game, this content must be disclosed in the content questionnaire. Please complete the questionnaire completely and truthfully. Steam will automatically generate an appropriate rating for your game in Germany. If the generated rating allows, your game will automatically become visible to customers in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q. What if my game has a USK rating?</strong><br/>
A. If your game has been issued an age rating by going through the rating process directly with USK, you may also enter that information within the store page editor for your game. This is rare. If you do not have an agreement directly with USK, do not enter a USK rating.</p>

      <title>China continues rising on the Steam Survey with Linux now at 1.87%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pretty much as expected, the Linux user share overall on Steam has dropped off a bit with the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for September 2024.</p>
<p>We almost always see the Linux user share drop, when Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam rises due to the popularity of Windows in China and just the massive amount of people there that cause the spikes to happen. Especially so with continued popularity of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall user share per operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.84% +0.06%</li>
<li>Linux 1.87% -0.05%</li>
<li>macOS 1.29% -0.01%</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a>, it's well within the expected trend still overall:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18493693261727854811gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifically on the Linux side here's the most-used distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64bit (Steam Deck) 39.20% -1.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64bit 8.66% +0.44%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64bit 6.03% -0.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 64bit 4.03% +4.03%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22 64bit 3.73% +0.75%</li>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx gets shut down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with yuzu</a>, many wondered if it would happen, and now it has. Nintendo has shut down the Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx.</p>
<p>Earlier today the <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page vanished into a 404 not found error, with some confusion amongst contributors. But it has now been confirmed on the official Discord and on social media that it's not an error. As stated in <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the post</a> the original creator was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement if they stopped working on it and removed everything related to Ryujinx.</p>
<p>It should be noted, this announcement comes from another contributor riperiperi, <em>not</em> the original Ryujinx creator gdkchan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953926441727817061gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of. While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.</p>
<p>These words are my own. I don't want to speak for anyone else here, so just remember that while reading.</p>
<p>Thank you to @everyone who has contributed code, documentation or issue reports to the project. Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special. I'm extending my own massive thanks to our moderation team, who have been here through some rough circumstances and always found ways to make light of it.</p>

<p>In related news Nintendo recently filed a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nintendo has continued their crackdown on YouTube videos showing their games being emulated, with Retro Game Corps recently being hit as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explained</a> in a post. Even though it was for the Wii U, a console no longer supported by Nintendo.</p>

      <title>Epic Games reduce their cut for Unreal Engine games for same-day Epic Store launches </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games are once again trying to entice more game developers to not only ship same-day on the Epic Games Store, but to use Unreal Engine too.</p>
<p>Announced during Unreal Fest Seattle 2024 is the new "Launch Everywhere with Epic" program. A deal for game developers and publishers that use Unreal Engine, to get a reduced royalty cut from 5% to 3.5%. This reduced cut will apply to all platforms and all stores (including Steam and consoles), as long as they ship their games at least same-day on the Epic Games Store. This new royalty model will begin January 1st, 2025.</p>
<p>This is on top of previous exclusive deals like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/epic-games-launch-first-run-and-now-on-epic-with-100-revenue-for-devs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic First Run</a>, that can give developers 100% of the revenue for 6 months before going back to their standard 88%/12% split.</p>
<p>No doubt something that will entice more developers to get their games shipped on the Epic Store, and likely Unreal Engine too since the royalty fee is quite low. It's also another way for them to get more developers to release on their new mobile stores too, since developers also get 100% of net revenue if they use their own in-app payment solution (or 88% using Epic's).</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store still has no official Linux desktop or Steam Deck support, so you'll need community-built software like Heroic Games and Lutris to work with it.</p>

      <title>Devolver launch Big Fan Games a label for indie devs to work on licensed games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Devolver Digital have just announced the proper launch of Big Fan Games, a new label that will work with indie developers to work on licensed content to make games from their favorite movies, comics, TV shows, and cult heroes and more.</p>
<p>They've already done collaborations in the past like John Wick Hex and Reigns: Game of Thrones. Although some are thanks to Good Shepherd Entertainment, which Devolver acquired back in 2021.</p>
<p>From the press release they note their team including people that have experience "working with games and entertainment properties like Dune, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead, Blair Witch, The Power Rangers and more".</p>
<p>Years and years ago, licensed games were a huge thing, they were everywhere. Movie tie-ins were often a given, but over time that was lost. So, it will be interesting to see what Big Fan Games along with indie developers can keep cooking up. However, the press release does stress that their goal is not for marketing tie-ins but for "fun and inventive games that stand on their own".</p>
<p>There's no doubt an endless list of movies and TV shows that would be prime settings for standalone games.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/news/introducing-big-fan-games-a-new-publisher-dedicated-to-creative-adaptations-of-iconic-entertainment-brands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launch announcement</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Jump and climb through huge structures in the creepy and atmospheric Lorn&#39;s Lure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lorn's Lure is a thoroughly odd game. It's all about jumping and climbing your way through these huge structures, with a creepy and lonely atmosphere it's certainly a unique experience not found elsewhere. <em>Note: Key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I've followed this with great interest since the first early preview versions, intrigued by the idea of the game. With an intro that instantly makes you sit back and just take it all in, you know you're in for something different. Lost and alone for 100s of years, you assume the role of an Android trying to find their way out of this…place.</p>
<p>You've by now seen all the complaints across social media about yellow paint, and various other forms of in-your-face sign-posting in games to show you the exact places to climb right? Well, Lorn's Lure strips all that away and basically says "good luck finding your way". A challenge, since it's pretty easy to get a bit turned around, but the exploration and wonder you get from it is quite something. That said, there's a few hints like a waypoint marker you can toggle but it's not forced on you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vAa2JQM7GRM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4ff78a00c24a153f791266cda7b7de06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vAa2JQM7GRM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, you're not <em>entirely</em> alone. The intro gives you a first glimpse at some kind of owl, that looks like a visual glitch that entices you to go deeper into the world. The mystery surrounding the world and what happened to everyone was really causing an itch in my brain that needed to be scratched, I had to find out more and go deeper. The atmospheric sounds are wonderfully done too, and really demand you turn the volume up and put on some good headphones to fully take in the feeling of it, and once I realised that it truly lured me in.</p>
<p>You get a lot of hints as to what happened, most of it through environmental story-telling, which is how it rewards the exploration and not always just blindly jumping around to keep progressing. A game that will truly leave a lot of burning questions in your mind. You will find some lore too, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p>Speedrunners will probably like what it provides as much as those who like to explore and take their time, and I would genuinely love to see some attempt it in this one because the control system along with various in-game challenges make it worth watching as much as playing.</p>
<p>No parkour here though, this is not a run and jump sort of game. With the help of your tools, you can climb practically every vertical wall. It's very much your choice on how you approach the game, although some parts are more enclosed and linear than others, it does a good job at spacing it all out throughout the game. It is a tough one, but the game mechanics are simple enough to get to grips with.</p>
<p>While it's a thorough challenge, it's not in any way punishing. The restart system from your last jump off a ledge makes experimenting with your positioning and choices on how you tackle all the platforming and climbing a fun thing. That doesn't in any way make it easy though. You're still going to fall to your doom countless times.</p>
<p>Really interesting. Check it out.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new racing game? #DRIVE Rally from Pixel Perfect Dude is officially out now in Early Access. <em>Note: my key was provided by Evolve PR.</em></p>
<p>I've not actually played many rally styled games recently, so this has been a bit of a treat. And, it's nice to see another with proper Linux support too, especially when we see games like EA SPORTS WRC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being completely broken</a>. Not quite the same of course, but #DRIVE Rally is a worthy addition to your racing game library even this early on. I generally prefer the more arcade-styled racers to the serious stuff anyway, and this is actually a pretty great blend between serious driving but with a more arcade look and feel overall and it works well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wyXsRMdI5O0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/557589aad648f3942564231482b7e2ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wyXsRMdI5O0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The more I played of it, the more I kept thinking it reminded me of something. Then it hit me! I adored <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/art-of-rally-strips-down-the-furious-sport-into-a-serene-top-down-experience/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">art of rally</a>, and this basically feels like a new blend of it that's slightly more like a traditional arcade rally game. For anyone who has played art of rally, that really is the best description I can give because of how it feels. Here though, it's a fair bit more extensive and in-depth so if you want something a little more it's already a good choice and it's not even done yet with more to come.</p>
<p>Something I did quite appreciate is the cinematic camera, allowing you to remove the HUD to just get you to appreciate the view and the race a lot more. And gosh, I genuinely <em>love</em> the visual style Pixel Perfect Dude has gone for here. While other bigger developers continue to chase realism (which lets face it, gets boring - where the <em>style</em>?!), this feels like the perfect middle-ground on visuals.</p>
<p>One change I would like to see is the ability to move the co-driver announcements to the top of the screen, they feel a bit buried as subtitled at the bottom right now. Would feel more natural to have the navigator text at the top where your focus generally is. And if they could add direction icons instead of just text like other rally games that would be a big improvement too. Another change I would also really like to see is more camera options, as they're quite limited. It's either right up close behind the vehicle, or inside it, with nothing else. Once those two requests are done, I truly think it would be a whole lot more special. Simple things, but essential for me.</p>
<p>While it is a brilliant start for the game it does have one problem — it's <em>far</em> too easy. I came first in everything, and I am truly a horrifically bad driver. There needs to be some difficulty options where you can customize the challenge to actually make it more fun. The driving feels great with handling that is exactly what I would expect from it on an Xbox Controller, it looks great, sounds pretty good too but it's simply too easy.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over 400 km of Rally Tracks</strong>: Tackle diverse environments inspired by real-world rally locations. From sun-scorched deserts to icy mountain roads, every track offers a different challenge.</li>
<li><strong>36 Customizable Cars Across 3 Unique Classes</strong>: Fine-tune your car to match your racing style. Each class modifies your vehicle's base stats, pushing you to adapt your driving to extract every bit of performance out of your car.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Co-Drivers</strong>: Your co-drivers will react in real-time to your performance, guiding you to victory or throwing in some sharp-tongued criticism. <em>Constructive</em> criticism, of course!</li>
<li><strong>Championship Mode</strong>: Choose a constructor and conquer all their stages. Rise to the top of the leaderboards and unlock customizable vehicle parts on your way there.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Mode</strong>: Capture your favorite moments with a state-of-the-art photo mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currently the Early Access edition has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 unique rally locations with up to 48 stages each (24 normal and 24 reverse).</li>
<li>Championship mode with 4 fully voiced co-drivers to guide or taunt you.</li>
<li>12 cars with unique performance stats, each with 3 different classes, providing a total of 36 variations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's in Early Access it's not finished, with plenty more content planned in regular updates.</p>
<p>Definitely enjoyed my time with it so far and once my issues above are solved, it will be then a must-buy. For now, though, I still think it's good but it's a few steps away from being truly great. I'll be keeping tabs on this one, giving it more thoughts as it adds in more features because I truly like what I'm seeing.</p>
<p>Available to buy with Native Linux support on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2494780/DRIVE_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/drive_rally" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>. There's no Steam Deck rating for it yet but the developer explained it has been "fully optimized for the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>Silence of the Siren is a new HoMM-like from the dev of Project Hospital</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a genre change for Project Hospital developer Oxymoron Games, as they've just put their Heroes of Might and Magic-like game Silence of the Siren into Early Access. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>A very promising one if you like the blend of exploration and turn-based strategy, although this is in a fun sci-fi setting where you're fighting for control over a distant star system. You get to explore what's left of various planets, secure resources, upgrade your bases and hire big armies. From what I've seen and tried of it, if you enjoyed Heroes of Might and Magic III then you're pretty much guaranteed to love this I think. For everyone else: it's a fantastic start for this mixtures of strategy, exploration and RPG mechanics that I'm excited to see now available.</p>
<p>Check out the Early Access trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-wUXy2DJ5QU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c62a618d6245fbb14d2bec23b975b46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-wUXy2DJ5QU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Current Features as of the EA release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 completed playable factions - <strong><em>Fossorians</em>, <em>Children of the Source</em>, <em>Sovereign Fleet</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
<li>Story campaign for the Fossorian faction with 4 levels (<em>average playtime &gt;12 hours</em>) + 9 playable skirmish maps.</li>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases and hire the strongest units.</li>
<li>Encounter a wide range of enemies in turn-based combat, use your tactical thinking to gain advantage on the battlefield.</li>
<li>Learn unique moves of your units, deploy your commander's special abilities and outsmart even much stronger opponents.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your enemies in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Available in: English, French, German, Spanish, Polish, Simplified Chinese, Hungarian.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers expect it to be in Early Access for around a year while they implement new features, bug fixes, general improvements and two more factions. There's already multiple tens of hours of content to play through right now.</p>
<p>Linux version seemed to work really nicely too. I'm somewhat in love with the style of the artwork as well. I'm a real sucker for sci-fi and the way this blends everything together looks fantastic in motion. Fun faction designs too. Absolutely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Available from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>. It has Native Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>Unique time-stopping horde-survival game Moon Watch now has a Steam demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't play this demo if you value having any free time at all. Seriously. Moon Watch is delightfully great and properly brings some unique additions to the now very popular horde-survival genre. From the creators of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a>, you know it's gonna be good!</p>
<p>Here you're taking on vampires — in space. That's right. You're smashing into their ship above your planet to hopefully take them down for good. Armed with a deck of weapons, and a unique watch fuelled by "high tech nonsense" and vampire blood, time will stop when you stop moving.</p>
<p>It has the frantic feeling of other survivor likes (hi Vampire Survivors), but gives you more room to think and breathe. Your abilities are from your deck of cards, which all cost energy that you build up while moving. So while stopped, you can flick through them and decide what ability to fire. It feels like a glorious fusion of Slay the Spire and Vampire Survivors in the way you progress.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tf90YqbOxDw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/238d7048b732fb200a47b763bf209b9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tf90YqbOxDw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really interesting mixture of gameplay mechanics in this one, that has thoroughly sucked in my attention something fierce. The demo isn't just a static build either, they're calling it a "Living Demo" as they're going to keep on upgrading it while building upon their unique gameplay.</p>
<p>For anyone who played the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/moon-watch-is-a-time-stopping-horde-survival-deck-builder-from-the-devs-of-backpack-hero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous web demo a highlighted</a> the good news is that there's a lot more to it now with the first two acts, two boss battles, new run rewards, randomised runs and just a whole lot more of everything.</p>
<p>Give it a try <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from the Steam page</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>In Thyria you enter dreams to combat demons in this unique party-based RPG </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I need of a new party-based RPG with dynamic exploration, turn-based combat and a fun gameplay loop? Thyria looks like a good one to pick up.</p>
<p>Thyria blends together exploring a colourful dynamic 2D isometric map, with turn-based battles where you enter the minds of cursed villagers to attempt to purge their demons with your summoned guardians. There's a lot of freedom in how you approach this one with each play-through being different, and with you able to customize your team of guardians throughout the game.</p>
<p>Not just that, but there's a whole time-management part to this too with a day and night cycle where you mix between battling living creatures in the overworld and entering dreams.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ODxW2dxsGpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e0e0e5a1243c4c5a0540a5c45f183a6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ODxW2dxsGpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summon your Guardians and get into the minds of the cursed villagers.</strong> Explore the dreams to collect Soul Dusts, Inks and knowledge. Treat your patient to increase the rewards but also the many risks... Each Guardian will offer a range of spells, and unique abilities. Redouble your strategy and perseverance to overcome the living nightmares, which creep in the heart of the most obscure dreams.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration.</strong> Steer Thyria on a procedurally generated 2D isometric map with varied landscapes. Various places offer exchanges, gifts… but also deception and fights! Maintain an inventory of relics that can optimize (or reduce…) the end of quest rewards. Face the living nightmares on the map using Thyria's arsenal, which will expand as the adventure unfolds. Always keep an eye on the clock to best manage the day / night cycles, the visibility and behavior of nightmares being greatly impacted!</li>
<li><strong>The fights.</strong> Defy the demons of every dream by deploying your Guardians, learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and use strategy to defeat the toughest monsters. The management of time, resources and individual resources will be the key to success!</li>
<li><strong>The laboratory.</strong> Learn how to merge two Soul Jewels and summon new Guardians! Each adventure will be different depending on your team, and each fight can be approached differently. Customize each Guardian: choose and combine spells before assigning them to the Guardian. Choose your spells before assigning them to the Guardian. Skill combinations increase the strategic aspect of each fight, it's up to you to find the right balance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608590/Thyria/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux support on Steam</a>. It's 40% off until October 14th.</p>

      <title>Evolve and fuse monsters in inventory management battler NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters is out today from DiceHit Games, Rogue Duck Interactive and it's another quality one in the inventory management auto-battler genre. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say and this is <em>very</em> similar in style to Backpack Hero, and then Backpack Battles even more so. The idea is to build up a backpack of creatures and items, moving them all around into the best possible position to have the highest possible battle power to take down opponents in automatic battles. It's a pretty cute entry with all the creature designs and is plenty of fun to play through.</p>
<p>As you progress you get monies to expand your backpack with additional slots, which you can place anywhere as long as one slot connects to another. And then you can buy and sell various items and creatures to fill it all up again.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RA9KfkjK5r8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16005ad92ef3d8fc2cabf801dfa6cb2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RA9KfkjK5r8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you <em>haven't</em> played auto-battlers or inventory management games before, I would consider NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters to be a really nice entry to it with the wonderfully sweet creature design and fun fusions. Some creatures have multiple types of fusions to transform, giving you many ways to tweak your inventory as you go depending on what items you can grab from the shop to give them different abilities. It's a pretty relaxed game to play through, with you able to go at your own pace too which is nice for people who don't like to rush.</p>
<p>Having little creatures instead of weapons is an interesting mix-up for the genre, but it really is <em>very</em> much like Backpack Battles. Here though the upgrade mechanic is an additional nice touch, allowing you to experiment quite a lot with your overall build. So even if you went for the same creatures, you can still try out different ways to progress through the battles each time.</p>
<p>The main issue I observed was specific to the Linux version, with some of the little overlay videos being blank. A common problem with the Unity game engine, with its limited support of video codecs on Linux. Trivial bug to solve, so I've let the developer know and they're working on it.</p>
<p>From the developer: "We’re so excited to finally release NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters. This game has been a labour of love from our small team, and we can’t wait to see how players experiment with Cosmions, fusions, and different builds. A big thank you to our devoted community of Duelists for all the support and feedback during development. We couldn’t have done without you." — Bahadır, Lead Developer at DiceHit Games.</p>

      <title>Merge spells to make new crazy combos in An Amazing Wizard: Prologue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An Amazing Wizard: Prologue just launched on Steam giving you a taste of a bigger game to come and if you like Dead Cells combat, along with the idea of fusing spells together to make unique combos this is for you.</p>
<p>While Valve are trying to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/valve-gives-developers-some-big-reasons-to-add-a-demo-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more devs to use demos</a>, we're still getting a few of these Prologue games and this is one you for sure need to be checking out. I still think the name is a bit too <em>generic</em>, but thankfully after now playing it, I can safely say the gameplay is great fun.</p>
<p>Similar in style to the likes of Dead Cells, Wizard of Legend, Skul the Hero Slayer and Noita it sort of blends a lot of their ideas together and if you like any of those you'll feel pretty at home with this one. Here you kill enemies and build up a list of spell scrolls, which you can swap around any time. However, the really fun part is at any time you can speak to the old wise guy and get him to merge two together. The result is that you're given a new spell with a combination of abilities and it means you can make some really cool stuff in it.</p>
<p>In the Prologue there's 60 unique spells, 100 permanent upgrades across 5 elemental play-styles, 100 enchantments and 2 worlds to battle through. The full game will have a <strong>lot</strong> more with 120+ spells across 7 elements, various playable characters, more worlds, more enemies, more bosses and the list goes on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4WTLblT2KY4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05e790366982a5ed171f70e98aba3207.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4WTLblT2KY4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely one not to miss. The action is really fun in this one with how much you can customize your play-through.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920980/An_Amazing_Wizard_Prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out now on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372660/An_Amazing_Wizard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full game</a> is due out early next year.</p>

      <title>Get cooking with tasty ingredients to make creatures in turn-based battler GladiEATers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of points for originality here. GladiEATers has a really fun idea that combines cooking and turn-based battles into something a little quirky. It's announced for a Steam (Windows) release but likely will run great with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Here you cook up a team of food-based monsters to command in turn-based battles and become champion of the CALosseum. With every battle starting off in the kitchen you get your basic ingredients and cook them up against the clock to turn them into powerful creatures. Each mini-game lets you change your GladiEATers’ form and boost its stats, but it’s up to you to choose how to spend your time. So you could create a really powerful strange creature, or send in a whole lot of boiled eggs to overwhelm an opponent.</p>
<p>With both a single-player mode, an endless roguelike mode and even online ranked versus battles this looks delicious. I want it.</p>

<p>More about the developer, MilkBubblesGames: an independent game studio working entirely remotely. Their team, made up of creatives from around the world, shares a love for pixel art. The group includes a designer, two programmers, a sound designer, two composers, and five artists. They came together to create GladiEATers, their first game, which has been in development for nearly three years.</p>

      <title>Swing around with a water gun while cleaning high-rise buildings in Aerial Cleaner</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you like your simpler games that have a fun unique idea then check out Aerial Cleaner, a 2D game about swinging around while cleaning high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Quite an amusing idea actually. Equipped with a water-jet gun, you jump off the roof attached by a rope and swing side to side as you attempt to clean everything up. The water gun recoil will push you towards what you need by firing backwards and swinging, and it's more challenging than it looks. Oh, there's also various weird creepy-crawly creatures that will try to get in your way.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_LQeggNGtRk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c3b127acb8972179cd7d849bf31271b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_LQeggNGtRk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Purpose Water Gun: The water jet gun serves multiple functions: it cleans dirt, propels the player by swinging from the recoil, and acts as a weapon against monsters.</li>
<li>High-Altitude Adventure: Scale skyscrapers with different themes, challenge your high-altitude cleaning skills, and experience the thrill of extreme cleaning missions.</li>
<li>Level Design: Explore diverse level designs, each with unique challenges and obstacles, testing players' reflexes and tactical skills.</li>
<li>Level Challenges: Completing each level's water and time limit challenges earns star rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam. It will release sometime in Q4 2024 with Linux support.</p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2989500/Aerial_Cleaner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>My favourite auto-battler Mechabellum is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing together the explosive destruction from real-time strategy games to the auto-battler genre, Mechabellum is a thoroughly good time and it's out now. <em>Disclosure: my key was originally sent by TriplePoint PR.</em></p>
<p>After being in Early Access for over a year the 1.0 release brings with it a new seasonal system, a new ranking system, new commander specialists to pick before the battle starts, optimizations and more. The game works great on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>While auto-battlers seemed like at one point they would be all the rage with Dota Underlords, Auto Chess and many other attempts they reasonably quickly died off like a bit of a fad. Mechabellum is different though, at least to me, because of just how exciting and ridiculously explosive the action is once it gets going. It feels a lot more strategic than other games in the genre and it's just damn fun to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TcJoUc7NaTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4cbd3c797f43d5bd6da207d20c541e34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TcJoUc7NaTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it being an auto-battler, you don't do anything while the fight is actually happening except sit back and watch the fireworks. Games are based on short rounds, and once you destroy all the enemy units what units <em>you</em> have left are counted up and their power is then used to take down the enemy's total health until one side hits zero. The strategy here is in what units you place down, where you place them and what upgrades and bonuses you pick as the rounds progress. It gets really engrossing and constantly gives me that need of just having one more game before I've ended up spending a good 2-3 hours round after round.</p>
<p>I just love seeing the big units stomp all over the little ones, or seeing big units get absolutely swarmed by lots of little ones. There's so many combinations you can use.</p>
<p>Battles are quick to get into and don't take much time at all to complete, so you can happily play it when you have time to spare and when you're in somewhat of a hurry during a coffee break. It's a great in-between game for people who love strategy games, but don't have hours to spend.</p>
<p>I've put a good bunch of hours into it and there's simply never a boring moment. Worth grabbing for sure.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Minecraft is getting a real creepy new biome and mob, plus item bundles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Live 2024 has been and gone and with it we've been given details on the next new biome and mob coming.</p>
<p>Releasing at some-point in a few months we'll see the Pale Garden biome, along with the new mob the Creaking. The developers said that they wanted to lean more into the scarier side of the game for this one. The Creaking is a mob that only moves when you look away from it, and it looks quite a lot like a tree making it more difficult to see in the dark. Quite a different mob too, since it has a connection to the trees, and you'll need to take down a special creaking heart block to actually destroy them. There's also new special audio for this biome too.</p>
<p>Watch the video reveal of the new biome and mob:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eHEQY3ua_uY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bd7771e8a76b722d03e863d5eefc944.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eHEQY3ua_uY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really love the whole vibe of that biome, good to see Mojang do more like this.</p>
<p>Another nice new feature coming soon is the introduction of Bundles, which were scrapped once before but they're finally becoming a real official thing. It's basically a bag inside your inventory, for you to dump stuff into it to reclaim some inventory slots. Enabling you to go exploring and mining for longer without having to constantly dump items.</p>
<p>See more about that in the below clip, which also goes over the Hardcore mode being added to Bedrock (already in Java):</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-15 released with an important fix for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have an NVIDIA GPU? Use GE-Proton? You should probably make sure you're on GE-Proton 9-15 which was just released. This is a "hotfix" build to clear up some problems from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/ge-proton-9-14-brings-fixes-for-star-citizen-god-of-war-ragnarok/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous recent release</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge -- fixes regression in video playback from 9-14.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git -- fixes regression which causes black textures and stuttering on NVIDIA cards.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git.</li>
<li>import upstream changes for lsteamclient.</li>
<li>update xalia to 0.4.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove deprecated workaround for Total War Rome 2.</li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured - Mortal Kombat 11</em></p>
<p>What's GE-Proton? A special community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris.

      <title>Valve (Steam) begin a direct collaboration with Arch Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is some pretty exciting news! The Arch Linux team have announced a new direct collaboration with Valve (Steam). Something that's not too surprising, since Valve do fund a lot of open source work, and SteamOS for Steam Deck is built directly on Arch Linux so working more closely together makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Posted to the Arch developer <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/RIZSKIBDSLY4S5J2E2STNP5DH4XZGJMR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mailing list</a> by Levente Polyak, the Arch Linux leader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are excited to announce that Arch Linux is entering into a direct collaboration with Valve. Valve is generously providing backing for two critical projects that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting work on a freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on them without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers.</p>
<p>This opportunity allows us to address some of the biggest outstanding challenges we have been facing for a while. The collaboration will speed-up the progress that would otherwise take much longer for us to achieve, and will ultimately unblock us from finally pursuing some of our planned endeavors. We are incredibly grateful for Valve to make this possible and for their explicit commitment to help and support Arch Linux.</p>
<p>These projects will follow our usual development and consensus-building workflows. [RFCs] will be created for any wide-ranging changes. Discussions on this mailing list as well as issue, milestone and epic planning in our GitLab will provide transparency and insight into the work. We believe this collaboration will greatly benefit Arch Linux, and are looking forward to share further development on this mailing list as work progresses.</p>
<p>[RFCs]: https://rfc.archlinux.page/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The secure signing enclave could certainly be an interesting one. What do you think Valve and the Arch team will be cooking up with that? <s>This is something that <em>could</em> perhaps be a useful change for anti-cheat to have a more secure platform on Arch and so SteamOS / Steam Deck, and potentially get more games to enable it for us.</s></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 28/09/24 - 14:13 UTC</strong>: Arch Linux packager and Valve collaborator Campbell Jones, mentioned to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enclave is essentially intended to be a way for us to PGP-sign packages with a single signing key instead of how we do it right now, which is with one personal key per packager. It will not benefit Proton or the anti-cheat situation in any way and is completely unrelated.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve has an amusing new anti-cheat system turning cheaters into frogs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are continuing to build up Deadlock, their fancy new third-person MOBA, with the introduction of a new anti-cheat system that's quite hilarious.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> launched yesterday noted an "initial Anti-Cheat detection system". It comes with a fun feature that allows players to either ban the detected cheater instantly and end the match, or turn the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then ban them after.</p>
<p>Valve devs say this new system is "set to conservative detection levels" while they work on an improved version 2 anti-cheat system that will be "more extensive". You also now have a cheat report option both in-game and post-game, with the main anti-cheat system to go live "in a couple of days".</p>
<p>Apart from that, this update was a reasonably big one too. This update has added in a new hero, Mirage:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6418278801727455129gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6418278801727455129gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19882739971727455727gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19882739971727455727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus there's also now a Custom Match mode and private lobbies got expanded with new options like enabling cheats, selecting the server, make the match public or private, supports post-game and replays and allows for picking a lane.</p>
<p>There's also performance improvements, expanded servers into South Africa, an Italian localization, voice indicators for speaking players, various bug fixes and numerous tweaks to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Deadlock is free to play, and runs on Linux via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. You still need to be invited to play.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper hits 1 million players - multiplayer and modding support to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper is a real gem with a simple yet highly satisfying gameplay loop, and it seems it's done well for Bippinbits. Even though they're working on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-has-you-manually-control-a-massive-planetary-defence-cannon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the incredible looking PVKK</a>, they're not done with Dome Keeper just yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1637320/view/4673137508062083950" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam for the two year release anniversary, a huge milestone has been hit as they said they "just hit 1.000.000 players". For any smaller developer, that really is an incredible thing. Dome Keeper has a Very Positive user rating on Steam with nearly 12,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>Some other fun facts were shared with 12,256,935 hours spent by players in the game, with 28,249 playing for over 50 hours and 81,867 managed to dig out the whole map while playing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UgbaE75yYPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bded6a20882d9d52ebe6d2eebdd70e03.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UgbaE75yYPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's been a lot of content updates to the game but there's also more to come. A balancing update with fixes ins due in October and after that in 2025 — multiplayer and modding. The developer said local multiplayer was easy enough, but still needs work, but online support has been much harder but they "still want to take a stab at it and see if we can get it done".</p>
<p>As they said it also means " it will get quiet on the development side at least for the rest of this year" as they have work to do but it's "also a big reason we want to fully enable and foster mods" with more info to come on that.</p>
<p>Dome Keeper has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can buy Dome Keeper from:</p>

      <title>Voidwrought looks like another great one for Hollow Knight fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a hand-drawn world of cosmic horrors, the upcoming 2D action-platformer metroidvania, Voidwrought looks like a real gem. Especially so if you're a Hollow Knight fan waiting on Hollow Knight: Silksong. Announced for release on October 24th, this one should work nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You may get tired of "hey this game looks like this game!" but…this is really <em>clearly</em> inspired by Hollow Knight, and we've seen a few more like it recently too. And that's a <em>good</em> thing! Voidwrought looks great in its own right. The visuals are fab, the setting sounds good and the combat looks delicious.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Pp2nZimBqTM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/864252854b825d8cc9bfec3a885eb99c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pp2nZimBqTM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience smooth, satisfying movement and tight controls.</li>
<li>Explore atmospheric, hand-drawn biomes, from the star-scorched Surface to the biomechanical Abandoned Expedition.</li>
<li>Fight over 70 enemies and 10 formidable bosses.</li>
<li>Customize your playstyle with over 30 active Relics and passive Souls.</li>
<li>Expand your shrine to discover new treasures, abilities, and secrets.</li>
<li>Enjoy a rich, foreboding score by Anima: Song of the Abyss and Vigil: The Longest Night composer Jouni Valjakka.</li>
</ul>

They've worked on titles ranging from adventure games, city-builders, and 3D platformers to horse riding games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2014550/Voidwrought/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. There's also a demo now available.</p>

      <title>Warside looks great for turn-based tactics Advance Wars fans, set for launch in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With inspiration (clearly) from Advance Wars and other wargames of the past, Warside is looking really good and they now have a real date, new trailer and demo available. Another one made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Take charge as one of twelve powerful Commanders, each touting distinct passive skills and Battle Powers. Wield these boons to change the tide of war and ensure victory through 30+ missions in a robust single-player Story Campaign. Additionally there will be a Skirmish mode, local and online co-op and local and online PvP too. Plus a built-in mission editor for anyone to make extras.</p>
<p>The developer has now confirmed the plan is to release on 28th January, 2025 and there's the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H0mJkTpe7ZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37c694cacca930f0089e54f6bc35bc5f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H0mJkTpe7ZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Warside began as a distraction to channel my energy into after an accident left me immobile for 18 months. My love for pixelated Wargames of the past helped it blossom into something special.” said Andy Savage, founder of LAVABIRD. "We hope you like our brand-new demo available now, and enjoy our modern take on the genre. We're excited to be part of the recent tactics resurgence and can't wait to show you Warside in full when it launches in January!"</p>
<p>At time of writing on Linux the demo is an empty download, so you'll need to force Proton on it until they fix that.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 gets a new Classes Overview Trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My most anticipated title for this year is looking awesome. Streets of Rogue 2 has a brand new Classes Overview Trailer for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>Not all classes will be available at the Early Access release though, as the developer will continue building up the game. Unlike some Early Access releases, this will not be a nearly-finished game, it will still be in constant development.</p>
<p>The new trailer shows off the freedom of choice you get highlighting a whole bunch of characters, each of them with their own abilities and unique way of dealing with various situations. There's the standard city-wrecking Soldier, a Cultist that allows you to pull in lots of followers, the crazed Gorilla that can topple buildings, you'll be able to go on heists as a Thief, or just settle down casually as a Farmer. Plus many more.</p>

<p>This game really seems like it's going to fill every need I have. It's like the craziness of the original, blended with classic-styled Grand Theft Auto on steroids. I am so excited for this it's unreal. <em>I need it right now.</em></p>
<p>Streets of Rogue 2 comes to Early Access on October 22nd. As far as we know it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>System76 release COSMIC Alpha 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 are continuing to expand and improve their new Linux desktop environment, COSMIC, with a second Alpha release now available for testing. Their goal with it, they said, is to "create the best, most consistent and flexible experience for users".</p>

Some of the differences they've highlighted are the comprehensive theming system with shareable themes, an option for either vertical or horizontal workspaces, integrated and easily accessible tiling system and highly customizable panels (dock and top bar).</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is a huge success selling over 270,000 in the first month, future plans detailed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>tobspr Games have a big hit on their hands here with the chilled-out factory-building automation sim shapez 2 managed to do really well in the first month. Currently in Early Access it has full Native Linux support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/4612337645064181837" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer mentioned they originally project it to sell about 90,000 in the first month but it's sold now over 273,000! For a smaller developer that's really impressive and it's life on Steam has only just begun. They said they "were completely overwhelmed and surprised by the response and success of the game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SFoml48FR2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be3417b8476aac2e78935fe3a3aa1d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SFoml48FR2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how many sales were across different platforms. Only 1.9% were on Linux and 2.9% of macOS. The developer also noted Linux has been a bit problematic as "it seems that Linux players had by far the most issues on launch, with sound problems and some crashes" but a lot of those should already be solved with an updated Unity game engine version.</p>
<p>Now that it's properly secure, they've also detailed some of their plans to keep expanding the game by bringing in more developers, along with adjusting their content plans. They're brainstorming new content, some of which may possibly need a new saved game but they will share more on that later.</p>
<p>They're working on multi-threading to improve performance to spread the load across more CPU cores. One example given was how on a i7-10700 CPU simulating 1.3 million buildings went from 0.8 FPS to 43.7 FPS! They're aiming to have this in the next major update.</p>

      <title>Steam Subscriber Agreement updated for disputes removing the need for individual arbitration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a change to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, which has been updated to remove the need for individual arbitration during disputes.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4696781406111167991" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve eliminated the requirement that disputes be resolved by individual arbitration. As always, we encourage you to contact Steam Support when you have any issues, as that will nearly always be the best way to reach a solution. But if that doesn’t work, the updated SSA now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration. We’ve also removed the class action waiver, as well as the cost and fee-shifting provisions, that were in prior versions of the SSA.<br/>
<br/>
For many of our customers (including the ones living in the EU and UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Quebec), these updates have limited impact as the arbitration rules did not apply to them even before the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the section of the Subscriber Agreement now says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10. APPLICABLE LAW/JURISDICTION</p>
<p>Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener" target="_new">https://support.steampowered.com/</a>. If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.</p>
<p>For All Subscribers Outside the European Union and United Kingdom:</p>
<p>You and Valve agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and Washington law, excluding conflict of laws principles and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governs all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this Agreement; or (iii) your use of Steam, your Account or the Content and Services. You and Valve agree that all disputes and claims between you and Valve (including any dispute or claim that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement) shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction. You and Valve hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or venue in such courts.</p>
<p>If the laws where you live mandate alternative dispute resolution options, you may seek a remedy under those options. If you are a consumer who lives in Russia, you may also seek a remedy with local Russian state courts.</p>
<p>For EU and UK Subscribers:</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the law of the country where you have your habitual residence.</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, the performance or the validity of the Subscriber Agreement, an amicable solution may be sought before any legal action. You can file your complaint at <a href="http://help.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://help.steampowered.com</a>. The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution website for EU consumers at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>. Participation in this website is not available to US companies, which is why Valve is not registered there. However, insofar as your complaint concerns the behavior of Valve’s data protection representative Valve GmbH you can file your complaint there.</p>
<p>In the event that an Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure fails, or if either Valve or you prefer not to resort to Alternative Dispute Resolution, you may bring proceedings in the courts of the place where you are domiciled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can view the original details on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240925000911/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#11" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wayback Machine Archive</a>.</p>
<p>From my admittedly limited legal knowledge, this seems like a <em>good</em> change for anyone who has a dispute with Valve, since individual arbitration often gives a lot of the power to companies and not consumers.</p>

      <title>Major flaw found in CUPS - time to run Linux system updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yesterday details went public about a major security issue that was found in CUPS, the open source printing system.</p>
<p>If you wish to read all the details you can do so in the <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Simone Margaritelli who found the problems. It's pretty technical stuff that most normal users likely won't understand, but the main point is that if you're on a desktop Linux system especially there's a high chance your system is vulnerable to it (especially if you use printers).</p>
<p>The issues are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-47176 | <strong>cups-browsed</strong> &lt;= 2.0.1 binds on UDP INADDR_ANY:631 trusting any packet from any source to trigger a <code class="inline-code">Get-Printer-Attributes</code> IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-47076 | <strong>libcupsfilters</strong> &lt;= 2.1b1 <code class="inline-code">cfGetPrinterAttributes5</code> does not validate or sanitize the IPP attributes returned from an IPP server, providing attacker controlled data to the rest of the CUPS system.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-47175 | <strong>libppd</strong> &lt;= 2.1b1 <code class="inline-code">ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2</code> does not validate or sanitize the IPP attributes when writing them to a temporary PPD file, allowing the injection of attacker controlled data in the resulting PPD.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-47177 | <strong>cups-filters</strong> &lt;= 2.0.1 <code class="inline-code">foomatic-rip</code> allows arbitrary command execution via the <code class="inline-code">FoomaticRIPCommandLine</code> PPD parameter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Summed up by Margaritelli they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A remote unauthenticated attacker can silently replace existing printers’ (or install new ones) IPP urls with a malicious one, resulting in arbitrary command execution (on the computer) when a print job is started (from that computer).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaritelli also suggests actually removing and disabling any services for cups-browsed, especially if you don't need it and then running updates. Regularly checking for updates is just sound advice anyway, make sure you're up to date often for security fixes.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck 2.3 out now with a fresh UI design, 3DS emulators return</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/emudeck-23-beta-brings-a-new-unified-ui-and-multi-language-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta period I covered previously</a>, the EmuDeck team have released EmuDeck 2.3 that comes with the big user interface overhaul. Not only that but Nintendo 3DS emulators have made a return.</p>
<p>Hold up, what's EmuDeck again? It's a system to make emulation easy across Steam Deck / SteamOS, desktop Linux, Windows and Android. It sets everything up for you and with this release, it should be easier than ever to use thanks to the fancy new interface.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main <a href="https://emudeck.github.io/blog/2026/09/25/emudeck-update-09-26-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> as noted in v2.3 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New unified UI.</li>
<li>Button to remove SRM entries in manage emulators.</li>
<li>Partial Multilanguage support.</li>
<li>Auto setup emulators on your device's language.</li>
<li>Lime3DS, a Citra fork has been added.</li>
<li>Citra is back! We've added PabloMK7 Citra's fork.</li>
<li>EmuDecky - Now you can update emulators from gaming mode (install from EmuDeck, not the Decky Store).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how the new UI looks:</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power major expansion released, plus a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power along with the free 1.13.0 "Basileus" update have launched, and it seems like it's actually really good news for Paradox.</p>
<p>Lately, Paradox have had quite a lot of issues with their releases. From cancelling games completely, to DLC for various games that have reviewed pretty poorly overall. So it's nice to see that Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power, at least from Steam user reviews, is showing up really well with a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>What's new in the DLC the main points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative Government:</strong> Experience medieval rule outside of the feudal system with a new style of empire management. A web of Governors jockeys for position in the empire with intrigue and power, sometimes rewarding merit and sometimes rewarding perfidy. Only a truly skilled Emperor can keep these squabbling forces in line.</li>
<li><strong>The Family Estate:</strong> Run and manage a powerful Family Estate, the seat of your House’s power, even when you hold no other land. Construct new buildings and improvements to further your power and influence within an administrative empire.</li>
<li><strong>Influence System:</strong> Build up a character’s influence within an administrative empire to climb the rungs of bureaucracy. Raise your status in the realm and gather more power for yourself. Start as a landless noble on an estate, and compete for valuable provinces to govern before making your bid for the Purple.</li>
<li><strong>A Life of Adventure:</strong> Freely roam the map, untied to any realm or holding, going wherever the winds of fortune blow you. Fulfill contracts as a landless adventurer, even through the generations, building up a reputation of your own. Earn gold, prestige and fame traveling the globe until you decide to settle down and claim land you have earned through merit.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Successor or Caesar:</strong> Spend the influence you have gathered to determine the course of the Empire and get the successor you want, whether a royal family member, a powerful noble, a martial hero, or any other candidate you can rally the people behind. The Emperor can even opt to co-rule if the burden of the throne is too much for one person.</li>
<li><strong>New Byzantine Flavor Content:</strong> New events, monuments and activities built around the Byzantine theme, including chariot racing.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetic Additions:</strong> A Byzantine-themed UI skin and new court fashions for your characters, new 2D event art, new on-map monuments of the Byzantine world, new on-map holding designs, and a Byzantine throne room for Royal Court sessions, among other aesthetic improvements. New music inspired by Orthodox holy chants is also included.</li>
</ul>

<p>Full details on all the changes available on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/now-available-roads-to-power-free-1-13-0-basileus-update.1705102/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paradox forum</a>. As usual for Paradox strategy games, it's lengthy and wordy and full of adjustments everywhere. The free patch that was released with it is also, surprisingly, pretty darn feature-filled as well containing a bunch of new game rules you can use, they added Court View and Court Artifacts to base game, historical characters can now appear across the map, a new starting year option, new events and so on.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting new free features for all players though is the "Choose a New Destiny" feature, so that you get to pick what happens to your game after you die - as long as you have a valid heir that is. The new options sound quite fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When you die, you now get the opportunity to switch to another character of your Dynasty that is not necessarily your direct Heir. Our game is a dynastic simulator, and we want to unlock playing through more branches of your Dynasty!</li>
<li>Players will be offered up to three categories of Destiny characters: An Interesting Destiny, a Challenging Destiny, and an Adventurous Destiny. Each category aims to offer a different flavor. The last category specifically will allow you to go Adventuring, if you own Roads to Power!</li>
<li>You can also select a Favorite Child (direct child or grand-child), who will then always appear as a New Destiny character. They will not get any extra titles or gold - in fact their siblings might get a bit jealous of their ‘favorite’ status.</li>
<li>For those who like to roll the Die of Fate - we have a special “Random Destiny” option with several random variants, to continue as any Dynasty character. It might still be your Heir, if that is what Fate determines.</li>
<li>You only get to Choose a New Destiny if you have a valid heir when you die. Securing your succession is an important part of CK3, and we want everyone to keep respecting that goal.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Din&#39;s Champion is dynamic rogue-lite RPG styled like Terraria from Soldak Entertainment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soldak Entertainment make some pretty quirky RPGs with a good few die-hard fans, and now they're trying something a bit different with Din's Champion.</p>
<p>Blending the basic theme of Terraria with 2D side-scrolling where you mine and gather resources, craft items and explore the world but with Soldak's dynamic RPG systems to give you a really unique game. The graphical style of it is a bit…<em>odd</em>, it looks like a Terraria "HD" mod almost but it seems to make up for it in all the gameplay systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9055945611727360653gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You have to build up a town, which can end up with 100s of NPCs that you can equip to help you out. Which you'll probably need, since the monsters can "form uprisings, start wars, set up ambushes, and attack your town". Heck, even without monsters there's a lot going on. Your NPCs can get plagues and curses, you have sneaky assassins to worry about too and then there's the physics system with various terrain that will collapse around you, gases can build up, liquids will be flowing and much more.</p>
<p>Character creation and upgrades sound interesting too, with the developer noting there's "over 50,000 combinations". Each run through should be unique with different bosses, biomes, monsters, items, traps, objects, and quests with is where the whole rogue-lite thing comes in.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a dynamic, evolving, living world where your choices truly impact the game.</li>
<li>Build your character as you see fit (attributes, specialties/classes, skills, and items).</li>
<li>Explore a unique area of Aleria in every game, with different bosses, biomes, monsters, items, and quests, giving the player a new experience every time.</li>
<li>Craft armor, weapons, tools, potions, materials, and town objects.</li>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress to get Lua support for modding, plus there&#39;s now babies and children</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Dwarf Fortress update has been released bringing with it some needed fixes, along with babies and some fun news about modding.</p>
<p>This is a Fortress Mode update, separate from the opt-in Adventure Mode Beta which still isn't ready for a main release just yet. The devs gave a word of warning though that it might nukes saves until a Steam issue is solved. Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4657374909372690154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux trainer crash fixed (again).</li>
<li>Added crash guard for bad civilian alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics additions/changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Dwarves/humans/elves/goblins/kobolds have child and baby images, new equipment, and palette support.</li>
<li>Garden and crop plants have more images.</li>
<li>Mandible portrait fixed for experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other bug fixes/tweaks</p>
<ul>
<li>Good/bad thoughts about tombs work.</li>
<li>Poisonous forgotten beasts work more reliably.</li>
<li>Various minor tweaks to input/layout.</li>
<li>Fixed drinks being destroyed on unretire.</li>
<li>Fixed a few broken sorts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The extra fun bit though — Lua modding is coming. They said it will allow you to "literally change the code to make custom behaviours and adapt the systems more expansively than ever" and it will also be the foundation for "the upcoming procedural magic system which will be added to all modes". Check out the video on it:</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.4.1 brings improvements for launchers, more robust D3D8, lots of game fixes for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11 for Linux used in Wine / Proton, DXVK version 2.4.1 is out today. This is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> able to run so many Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of improvements in this release!</p>
<h4>General improvements</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The size for memory chunks is now determined dynamically based on the amount of memory the application has already allocated.<br/>
This should improve the out-of-the-box behaviour in various game launchers; the <code class="inline-code">dxvk.maxChunkSize</code> option was removed accordingly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Vulkan swap chain would not always be recreated appropriately in a native Wayland environment. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4252" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4252</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with descriptor pools growing too large on Nvidia cards in some situations. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4166" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4166</a>)</li>
<li>Changed default shader code generation for DXBC <code class="inline-code">mad</code> instructions to work around flickering issues in games that use different vertex shaders to render the same geometry in multiple render passes. The <code class="inline-code">d3d11.longMad</code> and <code class="inline-code">d3d9.longMad</code> options were removed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4></h4>
<h4>D3D8 / D3D9</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall robustness of the D3D8 implementation with error handling and fixed various memory leaks.</li>
<li>Slightly improved performance by optimizing vertex buffer uploads. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4275" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4275</a>)</li>
<li>Significantly improved performance in some games using Software Vertex Processing. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4274</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed full-screen presentation issues in some Game Maker games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4245" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4245</a>)</li>
<li>Removed <code class="inline-code">VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT</code> from textures that don't need it. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4176" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4176</a>)</li>
<li>Enabled strict float emulation by default on AMDVLK now that this driver optimizes the pattern emitted by DXVK. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4203" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4203</a>). Do note that this was already the case on RADV.</li>
<li><strong>Chrome: Gold Edition</strong>: Enabled 60 FPS limit to work around game issues at higher frame rates. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#4260</a>)</li>

<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you don't actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the wild side, you can upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut is a big free upgrade coming in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slay the Princess is probably one of the best horror visual novels around, with absolutely glowing reviews everywhere and it's about to get bigger, for free. The developers have announced Slay the Princess - The Pristine Cut, a free upgrade that's going to release on October 24th.</p>
<p>In short it's going to add in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expands the game by roughly 35%. This means thousands of new voice lines, over a thousand new illustrations, and 17 tracks of brand new music.</li>
<li>Adds significant glow-ups for The Fury, The Den, and the Apotheosis, each of which has over three times as much stuff to see as they had in the base game.</li>
<li>Introduces three brand new Princesses that branch off of The Damsel, the Prisoner, and the Spectre.</li>
<li>Adds an entirely new ending to the game.</li>
<li>Adds a deep, interactive gallery to help you chart your progress across over 420 unlocks and that brings back your best (and worst) memories with the Princess.</li>
<li>Provides subtitle support for: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, European Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, German, Polish, French, Russian, and Italian.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It will also be coming to traditional consoles.</em></p>
