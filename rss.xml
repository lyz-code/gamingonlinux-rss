The rest of it is pulling in code from all the projects it uses like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for translating DirectX to Vulkan.</p>

      <title>Sony say their PSN account requirement on PC is so you can enjoy their games &#39;safely&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony forcing you to have a PlayStation Network account for all their recent PC releases hasn't been well liked, and they of course have no plans to back down on it.</p>
<p>During the latest Sony Group Corporation <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20241108/f5KHiS63/202503_2q_02_en/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">investors call</a> in their Q&amp;A session at about 45:40, a question came up about what lessons they will take away from Concord (which Sony shut down and then closed the game studio).</p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki (President, COO and CFO) replied with an English translation from a live interpreter, so the translation is a bit loose and <em>rough</em>, but this is what was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding that matter we have learned a lot. The way to face the issues regarding PC for instance, the PlayStation accounts that we have offered, by offering them for instance, sometimes that tends to invite push-back. But for the live service games, so in order to maintain order of the gaming, so that anybody can enjoy the game safely, we need to create environment conducive to that, of course enjoying the game freely. </p>
<p>Having some restrictions, may not call it rule, but to ask the users and gamers to follow the manner, and those balances are very important and we have to continue to seek the best way to achieve this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly the PSN requirement isn't going anywhere, and will be in all their future games, even though it's unpopular and locks out a whole lot of regions from buying their games. Sony want that extra control over their games, especially when they're now releasing outside of their own PlayStation console.</p>
<p>In <em>some</em> ways, it makes sense for their online live-service games, and you do have to remember the context of the question was for Concord that was <em>supposed</em> to be live-service. </p>
<p>However, it really makes very little sense for their single-player games where it's also now forced like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, Until Dawn, God of War Ragnar√∂k and more to come. Forcing online accounts for single-player games is never going to go down well but it's here to stay for Sony's PC releases.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for WiFi on Steam Deck, plus AMD GPU startup crash on Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big release of Steam Game Recording</a> in the stable Steam Client, there's a new smaller Beta available for Steam Deck and Desktop.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck side there's this fix that's specific to the Deck: "Fixed a case where WiFi power management settings could fail to be applied at startup.". I did notice quite a few people recently noting WiFi issues since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-36-officially-out-with-improved-performance-mura-compensation-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6 stable update</a> so perhaps this will help.</p>
<p>And the rest of the changes from the Desktop changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a potential startup crash on systems with an AMD GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the layout of the recording player in Big Picture.</li>
<li>Updated the Game Properties Game Recording tab to more accurately reflect the current state of the Game Recording feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where a controller could not show up in the UI the very first time it was connected for an account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with certain keys on the keyboard causing unexpected behavior.</li>
<li>Restores single-click Exit VR functionality</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Linux VR interface would show the incorrect UI</li>
</ul>

      <title>AYANEO 3 now officially announced with AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and HDR OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The AYANEO 3 has now had more of a proper announcement with more details and a clear picture of what it actually looks like.</p>
<p>Announced today it will come in two models with either the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 or the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U. You also get two different screen options between a 7" high-refresh LCD horizontal display and a 7" high-refresh high-brightness HDR OLED. AYANEO didn't say, but I <em>presume</em> the older AMD Ryzen chip will be paired up with the plain LCD screen to make their manufacturing simpler and cheaper.</p>
<p>AYANEO also said it will have new rear buttons and trigger lock keys, an "impressive leap in audio quality" along with "several proprietary key components" with more info to be revealed later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12367834241731089312gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - AYANEO 3, credit: AYANEO.</em></p>
<p>And of course, there's some fancy lighting around the thumbsticks too because everything <em>gamer</em> related has to has some form of RGB lighting.</p>
<p>They also put up a video for the announcement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GWObbquf1l4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/242ab6a7e87a1b7d87197c0fa2ff7c01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GWObbquf1l4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have not yet revealed a price. So while yes, it's an announcement, it's still pretty lacking in many details.</p>
<p>As a big fan of gaming handhelds as a regular Steam Deck gamer, I'm keen to see this hardware category continue to evolve, especially with a bit more power to run more of the latest games at acceptable performance.</p>
<p>For this though, since it will ship with Windows, we'll be waiting on the likes of Bazzite and ChimeraOS to get support for it hooked up for running Linux on it. Hopefully they won't have too much trouble with whatever these "proprietary key components" turn out to be, which does cause some concern.</p>
<p>So far then, it seems very much like their usual refresh of their handhelds, certainly <em>nothing</em> they've said comes even close to the "revolution" they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ayaneo-tease-the-ayaneo-3-as-a-revolution-and-a-completely-new-concept/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initially announced it as</a>.</p>
<p>More info when I have it.</p>

<p>Valve announced something that I'm sure a lot of game developers and players will appreciate: new APIs to allow developers to have version switching directly in their games!</p>
<p>Steam has long a way for players to <em>manually</em> opt into a Beta individually per-game, if one is available. This can be used for testing new features or for accessing previous versions. However the current system is somewhat obscure, and relies on you looking around various Steam news posts or forum posts for each game to know if there's a new feature Beta available, or if they provide an older version of the game you can switch over to via the Beta system.</p>
<p>Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547039255696769967" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> makes it clear that the idea of this new set of APIs is to allow game developers to present this to gamers <em>directly</em> in-game. Valve give some examples on why developers may want to use this like preserving game saves when making major changes to your game, something Paradox Interactive do with their various strategy games. Like this for Stellaris:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4109455851731088033gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So with the new system, developers could just put this in-game directly.</p>
<p>As part of this, a recent Steam client update also shows you on the game page in your Library when you have a Beta picked:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412717731731088693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really seems like a nice addition that I'm surprised hasn't been a thing until now. Hopefully more developers will think about keeping older versions available now, especially with Valve suggesting it as a good idea in some cases.</p>

      <title>Strategy game ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios who made Warhammer 40,000: Gladius have just released their brand new 4x strategy game ZEPHON. It comes with Native Linux support. It's <em>similar</em> to Gladius in a lot of ways, but set in their own universe that they can continue to expand on.</p>
<p>"Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>On the planet Earth, that was once a cradle of life, the extinction of humanity is at hand."</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zZXl5I73vys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c875cc338647d066581db592ab19351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zZXl5I73vys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer previously said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>Looks like a good one! The developer did send me a pre-release key but I haven't had time to write up any extended thoughts on it just yet, but from what I played it was really interesting and worked well on a technical level.</p>

      <title>Fedora KDE gets approval to be upgraded to sit alongside Fedora Workstation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Workstation with GNOME is the main edition of the Fedora Linux distribution, but their Fedora KDE Desktop Spin just got approval to become a lot more important.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> on their issue tracker, a proposal titled "Request to upgrade Fedora KDE Desktop Spin to Edition status under the Personal Systems WG" has now been approved! From the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As discussed at Flock, the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/KDE" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora KDE SIG</a> and the newly forming <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-personalsystems/wg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora Personal Systems Working Group</a> that will oversee the SIG are requesting that the Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop spin be upgraded to Edition status for Fedora Linux 42.</p>
<p>This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop Edition at the same level as Fedora Workstation Edition on fedoraproject.org</li>
<li>Production of a flagship site page for Fedora KDE similar to Fedora Workstation on fedoraproject.org</li>
<li>Marketing support in a similar vein to Workstation at events</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fedora KDE SIG will withdraw <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FedoraPlasmaWorkstation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">its Change for Fedora Linux 42 to replace GNOME with KDE Plasma on Workstation</a> with the acceptance of this request."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was opened 2 months ago, and was formally approved about 16 hours ago.</p>
<p>Now the work begins for the KDE maintainers at Fedora to get it all ready, and sometime soon hopefully it will then be prominently listed on the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20185156231731071134gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora KDE</em></p>
<p>As someone who mains KDE Plasma as their desktop environment, because I think it's fantastic, I'm really happy to see this happen.</p>

      <title>Comedy renaissance artwork styled adventure Death of the Reprobate is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now with Linux support is Death of the Reprobate, a comedy point and click adventure game styled like renaissance artwork from Joe Richardson.</p>
<p>This is the third and final instalment of the Immortal John Triptych, spiritual successor to Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary. You don't need to have played previous games though, it's thoroughly funny and weird to play through entirely by itself. If you love classic British comedy like Monty Python, you're going to love this.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G_OoKQ1E15c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30124f7cce6513c5fc637ba282666d5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G_OoKQ1E15c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pointing and Clicking ‚Äì A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork ‚Äì Renaissance, Rococo and even a hint of Romanticism, to be a little more precise. Hundreds of paintings, spanning hundreds of years, are all brought together into one consistent world.</li>
<li>Classical Music ‚Äì Music by Eduardo Antonello. Period appropriate music that adapts as the story progresses, recorded using real medieval/renaissance instruments.</li>
<li>Standalone Story ‚Äì Death of the Reprobate is set in the same world as Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary, and features some recurring characters/themes, but it can be played independently.</li>
<li>Highbrow Buffoonery ‚Äì Lofty subject matter is treated with gleeful flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cross-platform Nexus Mods app expands Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 support plus further UI improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't tell you how excited I am for the future of modding, with Nexus building their cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app. Another new build is out now with v0.6.3. Still very experimental overall though, with each update needing you to purge all previous files, so play with it at your own risk for now until they decide it's ready to support upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5772133201731069357gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5772133201731069357gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The app currently supports Stardew Valley, Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3. More will be added as they work on the various features needed. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nexus-mods-new-cross-platform-app-adds-support-for-heroic-games-launcher-and-baldurs-gate-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous update</a> even added support for games from the Heroic Games Launcher!</p>
<p>Everything that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Baldur's Gate 3 Improvements</strong></p>
<p>We are continuing to add features to support modding Baldur's Gate 3. In this update, we've focused on improving the Health Check diagnostics presented to the user and begun the back-end work to provide load ordering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Health Check diagnostic for outdated dependencies.</li>
<li>Added a Health Check diagnostic for invalid PAK files.</li>
<li>Improved the missing dependencies diagnostic message.</li>
<li>Additional metadata is being parsed from the PAK files.</li>
<li>Added support for serialising and deserialising modsettings.lsx to support load ordering in a future update.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collections requiring non-Nexus Mods files that can be directly downloaded are now supported.</li>
<li>Added the framework for a new Collection Download page which will show which mods are installed or missing from the library.</li>
<li>Standardised all "Button" components used across the app.</li>
<li>Added a new "Alerts" component to the app for dismiss-able notices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Migrated several backend functions from Nexus Mods API v1 to v2.</li>
<li>Cleared out lots of unused code related to earlier prototypes of the My Mods and Library pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting Baldur's Gate 3 on GOG (Windows) will now open the Larian Launcher rather than defaulting to the Vulkan version of the game.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Stardew Valley mods that used BOM characters in the manifest.json could not be read properly.</li>
<li>Selecting multiple mods to delete with Shift + Click will now delete all selected mods.</li>
<li>The badge next the the Library in the left menu will now properly decrease when items are deleted.</li>
<li>Mods in a collection can now be correctly downloaded from hidden mod pages.</li>
<li>Added missing tooltips to several buttons in the UI.</li>
<li>Fixed the "Running..." text getting stuck on the Play button.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the list-games CLI verb showing all games instead of the detected installations.</li>
<li>The main window will now pop into focus when the user successfully logs in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Installing a collection which includes mods where the user must browse an external website to obtain the file(s) will fail with no error message. This is not supported in the current build.</li>
<li>Trying to install a collection as a non-Premium user will fail with no error message. This is not supported in the current build.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>Once a collection is added to the app, it cannot be removed from the left menu.</li>
<li>Collections allow users to modify the included mods but do not allow you to reset them to the original state.</li>
<li>The first row of the My Mods or Library tables will sometimes be misaligned with the headers. Scrolling or adjusting any column width will correct this.</li>
<li>The "Switch View" option does not persist in the Library/Installed Mods view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy modding has been an issue on Linux for so long, and with the rise of devices like the Steam Deck, tools like this will be essential to get more people gaming.</p>
<p>You can download from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.6.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release page</a>. It includes an AppImage for Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s Deadlock adds proper Steam Input support with Steam Deck improvements and a new hero</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we still have no idea when Deadlock from Valve will get a properly public launch, since it's still invite-only, they do keep expanding the game in some major ways. Another big update just rolled out to this third-person MOBA.</p>
<p>Another new hero has entered the Hero Labs testing ground with Trapper:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14970522781731066293gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14970522781731066293gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also expanded the Hero Labs availability into Private Lobbies, Private Bot Games and Sandbox modes.</p>
<p>Making levelling up a bit simpler and quicker, there's now a Quickbuy system in the game. You can right-click items in the shop to add them to a queue, then you just need to pop to the shop to have them get automatically purchased.</p>
<p>On top of that Deadlock also now has full support of the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Game Recording</a> Timeline API so it will show markers for kills, deaths and more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the new and improved Steam Input support here's what the developers did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added all missing Steam Input Actions from the Key Bindings screen (including Fly Up/Fly Down)‚Äã</li>
<li>Added a "Replay Controls" action set‚Äã</li>
<li>Allow Steam Deck to see the Key Bindings Screen‚Äã</li>
<li>Improved Glyph Swapping behavior when mixing controller and keyboard inputs‚Äã</li>
<li>Added Controller tab to house Controller specific options.‚Äã</li>
<li>Added a Steam Input Configurator launch button.‚Äã</li>
<li>Added Glyph Locking options: { Automatic | Keyboard &amp; Mouse Only | Game Pad Only }‚Äã</li>
<li>Fixed crash in spectator mode when querying controller button state‚Äã</li>
<li>Fixed Controller not working until loading a level‚Äã</li>
<li>Official Steam Input configs for SteamDeck and DualSense have been updated‚Äã</li>
<li>Note: Legacy Analog Modes have been removed/replaced in favor of new Camera specific Steam Input modes. Some users may need to re-bind their joysticks/gyros.‚Äã</li>
</ul>
<p>There's lots more - see all in the <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/11-07-2024-update.44786/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update notes</a>.</p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. It's not clear if Valve will add a Native Linux version or not and it's not likely until much closer to the main release.</p>

      <title>Palworld dev details the patents Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing for</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in September</a> Nintendo and The Pokemon Company filed a lawsuit in Japan against Palworld developer Pocketpair, and now we actually know why.</p>
<p>It's a messy situation and obviously given that it's Nintendo, a lot of media have wanted to know more specifics. So Pocketpair have put up a news post to do exactly that. Now remember this is about patents, not copyright, so it's not about any creatures included in Palworld.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, as Pocketpair make clear, that Palworld was released on January 19, 2024 here below are the patents that Pocketpair say Nintendo are using against them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patent No. 7545191<br/>
[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br/>
[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]<br/>
<br/>
Patent No. 7493117<br/>
[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br/>
[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]<br/>
<br/>
Patent No. 7528390<br/>
[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br/>
[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those individual patents were <em>all</em> applied for <em>after</em> Palworld was released. Looking through them it seems the focus of the patents covers game mechanics like catching creatures and riding creatures.</p>
<p>You might look at the dates Pocketpair gave there (which are correct) and think ‚Äî well, they were filed after, so how can Nintendo sue using those? The answer is complicated. What Pocketpair <em>don't</em> say, is that these patents are from a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7349486B2/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">parent patent</a> which was registered in 2021 and approved in 2023, meaning it very much does end up applying here to Palworld.</p>
<p>What are Nintendo after then? An injunction against Palworld, a payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pok√©mon Company and a payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>So if Nintendo / The Pok√©mon Company win, and it's entirely possible based on the patent situation that they might, we will likely see Palworld no longer for sale.</p>
<p>See more in the Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The situation goes well beyond Palworld though. These patents for such specific game mechanics could stifle creativity in other games, and allow Nintendo to go after other game developers if they choose to do so. There's a growing amount of monster catching games, and this could end up causing future developers to reconsider making one. What a mess.</p>

      <title>The latest from Prime Gaming - November 7 edition - still great for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

<p>New since last covering include: Disney‚Ä¢Pixar Cars, Dishonored: Definitive Edition, Snakebird Complete, Close to the Sun, Bang Bang Racing.</p>
<p>There's lots more games coming throughout November including the likes of Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Blade of Darkness, Overcooked: Gourmet Edition, Chasm: The Rift, Elite Dangerous and more to come later.</p>
<p>The only one I'm <em>still</em> not including in this list is DOOM Eternal, as that's via the Microsoft Store (until Nov 13), which of course doesn't work at all on Steam Deck / Linux since it's a Windows-only thing. All the games in the list above you get to keep as Prime Gaming gives you a code to redeem!</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>
<p>See them all and claim from <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a>. You can also follow our new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Prime_Gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prime Gaming tag</a>!</p>
<p>Do you like seeing me keep this list up to date and want me to keep doing it? Let me know in the comments. I genuinely wasn't aware of how much stuff you can get until watching it more closely lately.</p>

      <title>The Spell Brigade is an online co-op survivor-like bullet-hell friendly-fire chaos festival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Spell Brigade from Bolt Blaster Games looks like a fun mixture of online co-op action and survivor-like mayhem and it appears to have sold rather well. Somehow I <em>entirely</em> missed it as well, even though it has Native Linux support and looks genuinely fun.</p>
<p>Especially interesting that it has friendly fire, so no one in the arena is safe. Oh my. There's also special team-based objectives, so they're really turning the idea of what survivor-likes can be into something unique here. Have a little look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aWuqQ25JsAU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/860c6f2383e1957bad38450a8c1b25e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aWuqQ25JsAU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how it's doing ‚Äì they just announced it's sold over 125,000 in less than two months. Very impressive. That would put them somewhere near 1 million GBP¬£ (before deductions from Valve, taxes and so on). Goes to show clearly there's a <em>lot</em> of hunger for these quick survivor-like action games right now and so no surprise why so many developers are doing their own spin on the genre.</p>
<p>From the developer: "We had high hopes for our game, but this has exceeded all our expectations, and it's only the beginning."‚Äã ‚Äã- Hans Jacobs, Game Director, Bolt Blaster Games</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survivors-like Gameplay with Multiplayer Madness</strong>: Enjoy the thrill of fighting thousands of weird monsters together. Complete missions and upgrade spells as a team. Survive together!</li>
<li><strong>Team-Based Combat:</strong> Assemble your Brigade and traverse the mystical warpath together. Experience the benefits of fighting as a team, even if it means occasionally stepping on each other‚Äôs toes. Fear not, as even the most unfortunate deaths can be remedied through the power of sorcery &amp; friendship.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Spell System:</strong> Find, upgrade, and combine your spells with powerful elements. The game ensures that no two builds are ever the same, and with multiple wizards in your squad, the potential for pure, unhinged chaos is endless!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Spell Brigade is also Steam Deck Verified. I have a key request in for this one today, so hopefully sometime soon I can have a proper look at it.</p>

<p>In a press release shared today, Kojima Productions announced they now have full control over the DEATH STRANDING IP. The game has also landed on Amazon Luna.</p>
<p>A good time to try it, with a sequel on the way, and honestly it's just an amazing experience. I completed it across a mixture of Steam Deck and desktop Linux playtime and really thoroughly enjoyed it. There's truly nothing else like it with the strange blend of game mechanics.</p>
<p>Kojima Productions mentioned they "will continue its focus on bringing their award-winning IP, "DEATH STRANDING" to more platforms and audiences" and simply that they also "today confirmed that the studio now has full ownership of the DEATH STRANDING IP".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19435577761730992601gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>If you have an Amazon Prime subscription, you'll also be able to play it free on Amazon Luna from December 1st for a limited time, after you'll need to subscribe to Luna+ to continue (where it's also available right now). Surprisingly, it even released on Xbox today too.</p>
<p>Really hoping that Death Stranding 2 isn't exclusive to PlayStation for too long, it deserves to be played on PC. And thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> I expect it to work quite well on Linux at release.</p>
<p>Also 50% off on Steam until November 11 if you want to grab it cheaps right now.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA GeForce NOW will soon limit your hours per month but some memberships get upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have announced some changes for the NVIDIA GeForce NOW game streaming service, so here's what you need to know. The service does work on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-make-it-easier-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA even released a Steam Deck install script</a>, although last I checked NVIDIA were artificially limiting streams to 1080p on all Linux systems.</p>
<p>Firstly for people on the Priority plan (the first paid plan after Free): they're renaming it to Performance and giving it a bump up to 1440p from 1080p, with Ultrawide and support for saving graphics settings in certain games.</p>
<p>As for people on the Free plan NVIDIA say you will now "see they‚Äôre streaming from basic rigs, with varying specs that offer entry-level cloud gaming and are optimized for capacity".</p>
<p>Secondly, the big bit: they're going to cap subscribers to 100 hours of play time per month starting next year. They say this accounts for about "94% of their total members. 15 hours of unused playtime will automatically roll over to the next month, and you'll be able to buy 15 hours extra if you want ($2.99 Performance / $5.99 Ultimate).</p>
<p><em>Across a month with 30 days that would work out to a bit over 3 hours a day, every day.</em></p>
<p>If you're an existing <em>active</em> subscriber they will enable you to continue having unlimited playtime until January 2026, so you have until December 31st, 2024 to sign up and <em>stay</em> active to get that deal.</p>

      <title>Unrailed 2: Back on Track arrives in Early Access for more co-op chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unrailed is a thoroughly entertaining and truly chaotic co-op game once it gets going, and now its bigger sequel has entered Early Access with Unrailed 2: Back on Track.</p>
<p>Just like the first game the idea is to clear a path and keep building a track for a train that will move between stations. This new edition to the series expands on it with a 4v4 versus mode (the previous game only had 2v2). If you liked the first game, it's an easy bet that you'll enjoy this one too. Seems like a careful evolution over the first game with new rewards and permanent upgrades with gameplay-modifying abilities, as well as new train engines, wagons and extensions to unlock. There's also the new custom map creation system included.</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zNiFLdgPxl8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6569728187ab7b2ad5aa9a88a93473eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zNiFLdgPxl8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The first game did have Native Linux support but this sequel currently does not. The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2211170/discussions/0/4040354495827695993/#c4846526298375535907" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> in the Steam forum to note they may add it in a later update like they did with the first game. However, they also said for now "the Proton version works very well on the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>Crazy vehicle combat rogue-lite REDLINE CROOKS is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REDLINE CROOKS is a vehicle combat pixel-art rogue-lite from developer Alexander Golke that's officially out now. I played the heck out of the demo on this one, so it's an easy suggestion to go and grab. Worked great too and was a lot of fun just smashing cars around, especially when the boss vehicles appear.</p>
<p>More: "REDLINE CROOKS is a unique, fast-paced combat-racer combining roguelite elements and breakneck speeds to make for a one-of-a-kind, high-octane experience. Charge through walls, cops and more using anything ranging from a tuned-up sports car to a forklift lacking certification. Why outrun the long arm of the law when you can slam it into a wall instead?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VldPVeBuVXw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af982d462e3218c1a11dbc41b9c8f57a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VldPVeBuVXw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pick one out of 9 playable convicts, each with distinct playstyles and character-specific upgrades.</li>
<li>Use the Boost to reach dangerously high speeds and blast through walls and enemies alike at the cost of your health.</li>
<li>Slam, blow up, launch, ram or otherwise destroy anyone looking to get you back behind bars, and be rewarded with cash and health.</li>
<li>Build an arsenal of powerful upgrades purchasable from the ever-trustworthy shopkeeper - there are over 100 items for you to mix and match, making every run unique.</li>
<li>Maneuver through randomly generated and fully destructible tracks, requiring constant improvisation.</li>
<li>Perform well to rank up, ramping up both the difficulty and the rewards you get using a God Hand-inspired difficulty scaling system.</li>
<li>Master the intricate mechanics and make it to the top of the online leaderboard, or just have a good time in this easy to play, hard to master experience.</li>
<li>Test your skills by completing jobs, earning stamps which can be exchanged for customization options and more.</li>
<li>Jam out to an awesome, original digital-fusion soundtrack by Adam Carey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Another easy pick up and play game that has a Native Linux version available.</p>

      <title>Vampire Hunters turns Vampire Survivors into an FPS where you stack 14 weapons together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There seems to be no end to games that will suck away all of my free time and now that Vampire Hunters is out now, it's also going into my regular rotation to blow off some steam. <em>Note: key originally provided for me.</em></p>
<p>I actually took a look at this originally in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fv7ujr9YOA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> for the Steam Deck well over a year ago. Back then though, it was a corridor-shooter where you just ran forwards blasting everything in your path. A good basic idea, but the gameplay just wasn't quite there. It was just too flat with it being a constant forwards runner. Now though? It's much more like Vampire Survivors in 3D as an FPS, with proper open levels to run around in ‚Äî and that's great.</p>
<p>Here you run around shooting everything that comes you way, pick up experience orbs and when you level up you can pick up to 14 weapons to stack together to turn yourself into a one-person annihilation machine. There's various character buffs to choose, weapon upgrades as well and it just becomes pure and total chaos.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FJKtBTJj3N0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/823b73f8581b829b5b2ef28658bdbb1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FJKtBTJj3N0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For players who like customization and progression there's plenty of that too. With multiple characters to choose from each with strengths and weaknesses, plus you can change starting equipment for each of them too. Outside of that as you progress more through the game, you will end up unlocking more and more to use during your next run. Then there's also character skill trees and permanent upgrades as well. Lots to keep you interested in playing more of it.</p>
<p>Since it's pretty over the top in both enemy numbers, and your screen filling up with weapons, it's nice to see there's a few accessibility options to help. You can play it like a proper FPS for starters, but by default weapons will auto-fire, so all you have to do is aim. You can also change the enemy outline that shows behind walls and objects to help you see them between a few different styles and colours - nice.</p>
<p>Plus, since you get a lot of weapons, you can also choose to have them combined down to one side, or both sides, to give you more room to focus. Which you'll probably need, because it's actually quite challenging once it gets going and you've got tons of enemies lining up from all directions.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stack Your Arsenal: </strong>Create mind-blowing builds by combining firearms, relics, artifacts, and character abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Slay Thousands: </strong>Battle against waves of vampires, demons, and other supernatural creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Fire At Will: </strong>Experience true control by switching between automatic and manual firing modes, giving you precise command over your arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Character Abilities: </strong>Each hunter has distinct playstyles and skill trees to customize your approach.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Mayhem: </strong>Enjoy an engaging mix of old-school FPS action and roguelite gameplay, with an average playtime of around 20 hours and infinite replayability.</li>
<li><strong>Absurd, Cheesy, and Fun:</strong> Experience a lighthearted tone with exciting electronic disco vibes that make every session a blast!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love the basic idea of Vampire Survivors to repeat runs, and create some utterly ridiculous character builds but prefer first-person shooters then this is absolutely for you. The shooting and destruction feels quite satisfying when you've got a nice stacked build of weapons.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, I would suggest you drop it down to the Medium preset, otherwise later in the runs it may chug a little. But on medium it seemed to hold 45FPS quite nicely. Valve gave it the green Steam Deck Verified tick too. Naturally on desktop with even a slightly more powerful system it runs as well as you would expect it to.</p>

      <title>Disney-styled classic horror game Bye Sweet Carole looks great in the recent trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bye Sweet Carole is an upcoming chilling narrative-horror game inspired by classic animation movies like Disney along with the works of Chris Darril. Late last month a new trailer arrived and it looks good. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bye-sweet-carole-blends-horror-with-what-looks-like-classic-disney-movies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A game I pointed out back in May</a> after somehow missing it before. I'm cautiously excited about this one, because the style really does look incredible, I just hope the gameplay is there too.</p>
<p>The new trailer shows off new gameplay and the awful owl, Velenia. Set in the early 1900s, in an age where the phenomenon of the feminist political movement begins to shake the British nation, Bye Sweet Carole takes players on a mysterious investigation of the eerie Bunny Hall orphanage where Lana Benton is the only one to suspect that her best friend Carole didn‚Äôt just run away.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>

<p>It's pretty high up on my own wishlist. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to play it on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is getting a free online co-op update soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth developer Edmund McMillen has announced that The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is soon to get a free online co-up update.</p>
<p>McMillen <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> the update will come on November 18th and have "a full online co-op mode ( with completion markers ) along side a considerable balance update that heavily focuses on buffing items you guys believe are lackluster/bad".</p>
<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has a Native Linux build, but at this point it's unsupported, as the latest DLC The Binding of Isaac: Repentance doesn't even work with it. You should just use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy rogue-lite elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac‚Äôs form giving him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets and fight his way to safety.</p>

<p>To celebrate the date and the tenth anniversary the developer has put the game and DLC on sale until November 11.</p>

      <title>HORI Steam Controller releases in the USA in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're after a tightly integrated Steam Controller, maybe the new Wireless HORIPAD for Steam might be for you. And good news, it's finally releasing in the USA.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hori-announced-a-special-gamepad-for-steam-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in June</a> it was previously only available in Japan. At least now it's coming to the USA on December 16, many more people will be able to order it. This makes it significantly easier for everyone else too, since importing will be simpler.</p>
<p>Quite a feature-filled controller with 4 extra buttons (2 on the front at the bottom, 2 on the back) to program to do whatever you want. Unlike a lot of other controllers (I'm talking about you 8bitdo), you can actually change the extra buttons via Steam Input too. It also has Capacitive Touch thumbsticks, gyro, and dedicated Steam function buttons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5804901501730886645gol1.png"/></p>
<p>HORI say it will give you about 12 hours of battery via Bluetooth, and can be used while plugged in and charging too. They claim full support of the Steam Deck, but curiously only say the wired mode via Xinput is for Windows 11/10 - likely they just haven't done any testing on desktop Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There are some downsides however, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>No rumble.</li>
<li>A built-in battery.</li>
<li>No headset jack.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLLKRFG8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. Priced at $59.99. More on their <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/hpc-055U" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a little torn. I don't need another controller, but I love tech, and it's a nice idea to have all the dedicated Steam buttons making it a great fit for my Steam Deck gaming when docked. Being able to actually have full support though of all the buttons directly via Steam is a big selling point for me. I've never really cared about rumble personally.</p>

      <title>Steam Game Recording has officially launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No longer should you need external software just to record a fun clip of gameplay on Steam desktop and Steam Deck, with Steam Game Recording now officially live for everyone. Arriving as part of a big update to the Steam Client there's a lot of changes, which also has Valve drop support for Windows 7 and 8.</p>
<p>This system enables you to have continuous recording of gameplay, or you can set it to record manually on a hotkey. From there you can then clip it easily directly in the Steam client to share anywhere. It works for any game, even non-Steam games you've added to your library.</p>
<p>It comes with a new SDK and API developers can hook into as well. If a game adds direct support they can add various special markers to the recording timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20073396591730884932gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Shipped as part of this update are some Steam Deck specific changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games stored on an external drive still showing as available when the drive is removed.</li>
<li>Changed the enter action on the login password entry to attempt login rather than requiring navigation to the "submit" button.</li>
<li>Improve compatibility for native titles that have not been reviewed yet by launching them in the same runtime environment as reviewed titles.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the Bluetooth settings tab would disappear if the system was in sleep mode for an extended period of time and resumed without an internet connection.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where controllers were unresponsive if a malfunctioning third party compatibility tool was installed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And also various Linux improvements too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed slow startup on systems where the reverse hostname lookup for the loopback interface is not localhost.</li>
<li>Detecting and passing commands to an already running Steam client is significantly faster.</li>
<li>Added a -disable-screensaver-inhibit command line option to prevent Steam from inhibiting the screen saver when activity is detected.</li>
<li>Fixed Linux crash launching steamwebhelper occurring with some system configurations.</li>
<li>Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.</li>
<li>Native titles will execute in 'Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)' by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment.<br/>
	This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions.<br/>
	Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with "-compat-force-slr off" on the Steam client command line.</li>
<li>Always allow the Steam client to fallback to X11 when SDL_VIDEODRIVER/SDL_VIDERO_DRIVER is set to wayland.</li>
<li>Removed the UI toggle to disable Steam Play globally, correctly reflecting that Steam Play is always enabled on Linux. Steam Play was always partially active even when set to off in the UI as it is a requirement for Steam client operation.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the wrong DPI scaling factor would be used for systems using a non-gnome based session with an active gnome-desktop-portal service.</li>
<li>Extended recent Steam Play fixes to third party compatibility tools.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck comes to Australia on November 19</title>

      <title>Lucky Tower Ultimate is an absurdly funny dungeon crawler you need to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lucky Tower Ultimate from Studio Seufz is probably one of the funniest real-time dungeon crawlers I've ever played and I can't wait to play more. Developed by Studio Seufz, who some might recognise from their previous game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/the-longing-is-out-today-so-you-can-begin-your-own-400-day-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Longing</a> (which I also really liked).<em> Note: key provided by Evolve PR.</em></p>
<p>Older readers might recognise the name Lucky Tower too, since it was a series of Flash games from quite a few years ago. Lucky Tower Ultimate is the third in the series, updated for new audiences and given a modern rogue-lite taste, you don't need to know anything about it to play this though it's completely standalone.</p>
<p>Here's the thing ‚Äî some dungeon crawlers can be thoroughly frustrating to play. I end up getting annoyed, cursing at the screen and not in a fun way and so just stop playing and give up on them. Not the case here though thanks to the totally ridiculous slapstick comedy of Lucky Tower Ultimate. Each death was either a belly laugh or a rather silly surprise. It captured my attention instantly, and I haven't wanted to put it down and I still don't want to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13530955131730828395gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13530955131730828395gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea here is that one night while having a drink at the local tavern, you go to use the <em>facilities</em> and you're suddenly teleported into a strange tower with nothing but your underwear. The <em>top</em> of the tower too, not the bottom, so you have to work your way down as you go through various doors. With some truly comical moments, backed up by some nice voice acting, it's certainly an experience you won't forget. Part of what makes it funny, is that you can pick up pretty much all items to use as weapons ‚Äî including creatures and people.</p>
<p><em>I'm just going to give you a small slice of what to expect from it‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p>In my first run, I came across an old lady wandering around. After a little chat, I accidentally picked her up and shook her about for some loot. Obviously she was unhappy about this and slapped me dead. Well, that was a short run for my first go. On my second run I opened a door and walked into a room that was entirely full of barrels of dynamite with lit fuses, and then the entire tower blew up. Taking a second look inside "just to be sure" wasn't my best idea. You can see where this is going right? This game is the story of how you will die a thousand different ways.</p>
<p>At times a creepy wizard will appear and offer you items for free. Like potions! Who doesn't love a fancy potion! I decided to drink it, for science, and ‚Äî dead again. The very next run they promptly appeared in front of me again, and dropped a hammer for me, so perhaps I can trust them? That is a helpful item indeed to smash some goblins with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19582950261730826955gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19582950261730826955gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Run number‚Ä¶oh I don't know I've lost count, I found the old lady again. This time she was trapped in a cage, so I freed her and it turns out her name is Alva and she can give you potions. Hooray! Off we go into another room where a creature was sat at a table with three pots. They offered me a bet: pick the right pot that has a tooth under it after they spin them around and win a prize, lose and forfeit a wager. I clearly wasn‚Äôt paying attention as my wager was supposed to be placed on a button behind me‚Ä¶right where Alva was stood. I lost and Alva got turned into food. Stupid creature <em>cheated</em> though! I picked right at least once and they said they weren‚Äôt paying attention so spun the pots again. Annoyed, I hit them with a hammer and they punched the life out of me. <em>That's another run over.</em></p>
<p>One run lasted all of about 30 seconds. As I walked into a room that <em>seemed</em> safe, so I took a hand off my controller for a few seconds to grab a drink next to me and the floor opened up and goodbye hero ‚Äî dammit!</p>
<p>Every time I think I'm doing well, and that I'm safe, the tower has other ideas. Hear some screaming getting louder? Well, standing around to find out wasn't my brightest idea as this thing below smashed through the wall and promptly smashed <em>me</em> with a rather large hammer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14516132261730826763gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14516132261730826763gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Okay. Next time I will beat it for sure, I say to myself.</p>
<p>I walk into a room and there's a creature asleep on a chair. Near the creature is a horn on the floor, obviously I didn't see it so I stepped on it creating a <em>honk</em> and the creature cheekily opens one eye to take a little look. So I back off, wait for them to sleep again and try to creep past‚Ä¶but they wake up and quickly scoop me up into their mouth. I became lunch. Run over. Ouch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929342951730826651gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929342951730826651gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What makes it great is that it really is mechanically simple. From movement to combat, it's all very basic. It's the silliness of it, and all the different encounters and traps that make it worth playing through. The design is just fantastic.</p>
<p>I could go on for quite some time about how stupidly I died, and how each death made me want to just play more. But I'll leave you with that small slice for now. Lucky Tower Ultimate is all about expecting the unexpected, and then probably dying in some really silly way. Truly fun.</p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access these are just my initial thoughts on it, and I'll be playing a whole lot more right up until release where I'll be covering it again no doubt. The developer has announced a big content update is due out <em>today</em> (Nov 5th) too, so that's my late evening and probably into the early hours entirely written-off to play and discover more.</p>
<p>It plays <em>beautifully</em> with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>, with my time playing it on Steam Deck across a mixture of docking it up to a TV and playing it handheld. Not a single problem encountered, which is why it's a surprise to see it only rated Steam Deck Playable as everything appears to work out of the box.</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest recommendations I've ever done. Go buy it.</p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster to release in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the news that the classic Croc Legend of the Gobbos was getting a remaster, and then we learned it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-will-be-a-gog-exclusive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would be a GOG exclusive</a>. Now we at least know it will release in December, although they're not giving us an exact date as to when just yet.</p>
<p>More about it: Croc Legend of the Gobbos follows the heartwarming journey of an endearing, humble little crocodile equipped with only his iconic backpack and a wiggly butt as he sets off on his quest to rescue the Gobbos from the clutches of the nefarious Baron Dante and his hordes of Dantinis. Croc must platform his way across a series of unique worlds by running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail spinning to save the Gobbos from captivity.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T2SZtxMF2Jg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fede7814905cacae43f7a28050fd3b36.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T2SZtxMF2Jg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: ‚ÄúFrom the outset, our vision has been to release Croc only when we‚Äôre happy with it. We are speed-running towards a December 2024 release and are very close to being complete. However, if we need to add a little more polish, we won‚Äôt hesitate to do so. After waiting 27 years, we trust that our dedicated fans can wait a few weeks longer,‚Äù said Jez San, Founder of Argonaut Games.</p>
<p>San continued: "The Croc remaster aims to reignite the imaginations of players with its enhanced HD graphics, updated modern controls, and an authentic gameplay experience that will transport players back to the golden age of gaming."</p>
<p>At release it will be $29.99.</p>

      <title>Playing with special beans in Bean To Me! is messing with my brain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't judge me on this one, but I've been playing with beans for a while in the new release of Bean To Me! from Melonleaf Industries / Very Evil Demons. Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, beans. Inspired by the ancient game of Mancala, it's all about two players trying to move beans around a simple board with little cups. It's strangely captivating and takes a while to learn properly but the basic idea is simple enough. You're just moving beans from one side of the board to the other, eventually getting them into your big pot to score and it's a race of minds in turn-based strategy to get as many beans as possible before one player runs out and the game is over.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2744000521730808630gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On the surface it may <em>seem</em> quite simple however it's anything but. And I don't think I've quite gotten the hang of it properly yet, but I'm really enjoying the idea as I've not actually played a game like this before. Mechanically simple at least, you just click a pot that has beans and your hand will gather them all up, moving to the right depositing one bean over each pot as it goes. It doesn't stop on your side though, if you click a pot with many beans your hand will keep going over to your opponent to deposit beans as well.</p>
<p>The key is in the bean placement, as there's ways to steal a whole big lot of beans from your opponent. You can also get an extra go if you plan right, by dropping your last bean in your hand into your big pot to add to your score with no beans going to your opponent's side. Then there's all the special kinds of beans you can unlock to take into battle with you, some might even explode destroying other beans that can really mess with things.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot to think about during each run. And I actually needed to play the tutorial twice to properly get the mechanics. After that, it's a lot of trial and error with all the different types of special beans and before you know it a few hours have vanished like a runner bean.</p>
<p>Playable in single-player, local multiplayer and online too so you can challenge friends. It has Native Linux support and works great.</p>
<p>Really great. A wonderful idea that's simple to get into but surprisingly hard to master and will keep you thinking for hours. Cheap too at ¬£4.29 when not on sale.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6.9 released with a new friend to help you find lost items</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like Terraria, work never seems to be finished on Stardew Valley, with a brand new update out now with a few new features and surprises. Stardew Valley is probably one of the best casual games out there, really nice to chill with. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> here's the main new content and features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you lost an item that can‚Äôt be found again, a <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods#Lost_Items_Shop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new friend appears in the secret woods</a> who can get it back (for a price).</li>
<li>You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. These are limited to one per pond and produce legendary fish roe. Each fish has a unique water color.</li>
<li>You can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture.</li>
<li>Items dropped in water now float for a short time, so you can collect them if you‚Äôre quick or have a magnet ring.</li>
<li>Sam and Shane now have work portraits while working at JojaMart.</li>
<li>Slightly tweaked some dialogues.</li>
<li>Added new Easter eggs.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Multiplayer#Cheat_commands" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hidden cheat commands</a>. (Only on platforms where a save edit is possible)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20852832921730806162gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's plenty more balance changes, quality of life improvements and bug fixes too. The developer also updated SDL from 2.0.x to 2.30.4 that should keep it running nicely, and they also swapped from FAudio to OpenAL which they said should "improve performance when playing audio".</p>
<p>Players using a controller / Steam Deck will also be glad to know there's also some gamepad improvements too like various crashes being fixed and some UI issues.</p>

      <title>Manjaro Linux want your system info with their new data collection tool</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Manjaro Linux team are asking for testers for their new data collection tool called "Manjaro Data Donor", which they plan to have as opt-out and not opt-in.</p>
<p>As expected, they are catching some comments from users not particularly happy about their plan to have it hooked up as something you have to opt out of due to privacy concerns. Telemetry is often a bad word to a lot of people, but the reality is that when done correctly it can be truly essential for projects to know where to focus. </p>
<p>Manjaro developer Roman Gilg said in the <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/testers-needed-manjaro-data-donor/170163" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> that currently they use <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Matomo</a>, which is pinged via the Network Manager but it's unreliable for various reasons. So they created Manjaro Data Donor (MDD) which gives more information and should be more reliable overall, and they actually have full control over it.</p>
<p>Currently they just want Manjaro users to test it and give feedback, but eventually it will be hooked up as a systemd service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next few days we‚Äôll do some more testing and if results are positive, I plan on installing it on all Manjaro systems and adding a systemd service to submit the data automatically.</p>
<p>As a reminder: Right now you have to install MDD manually and there is no systemd service yet.</p>
<p>With this systemd service later in place, sending the hardware data with MDD will be opt-out because I believe, if you do opt-in, the data you gather will be so heavily skewed you can just leave it be.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. I know telemetry is a contentious subject, but we need at least some data about how Manjaro is being used by so many people around the world in order to show that the project has a future and also to plan for that future.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.20 update released for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are acting quickly to clean up some Steam Deck problems from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-36-officially-out-with-improved-performance-mura-compensation-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the huge SteamOS 3.6 update</a> with a new SteamOS 3.6.20 update released for everyone.</p>
<p>This time it's just a few bits but all pretty nice to see:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the updater could repeatedly revert you to the previous OS version if certain configuration files were user-modified.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with taking multiple screenshots if Game Recording is on.</li>
<li>Improved performance in Metaphor: ReFantazio by up to 20%.</li>

<p>Are you currently having issues you want to see solved? What are your biggest problems right now?</p>
<p>Mine is a small one but still annoying: when docking to my main 4K TV, the performance overlay is absolutely tiny and unreadable. It's a really odd issue, but I would like to see it solved with some proper scaling of the performance overlay. It happens with every dock I've tried including Valve's official dock, multiple from JSAUX to the recently tested <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-benq-becreatus-gr10-usb4-steam-deck-dock-is-simply-great/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BenQ beCreatus GR10</a>.</p>

      <title>The BenQ beCreatus GR10 USB4 Steam Deck Dock is simply great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While a little on the pricey side, the BenQ beCreatus GR10 USB4 Steam Deck Dock is a worthy addition to your arsenal for both at home and while you're on the go. <em>Disclosure: BenQ sent over the device for review, I did not need to send it back.</em></p>
<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of docks out there now including the official one from Valve, multiple from JSAUX, UGREEN and the list of companies doing them goes on for a while. Valve basically created another little accessory industry here. Most of them are quite similar but BenQ are at least doing something a little <em>different</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4452880041730740182gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It has some nice specifications to begin with including:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB4 Type-C cable for device connection. This comes with a removable 90 degree USB-C adaptor already attached.</li>
<li>USB-C PD charger (input max 100W).</li>
<li>USB-A Connector (10 Gbps, 4.5W charging) x 2.</li>
<li>USB-C Connector (10 Gbps, 7.5W charging) x 1.</li>
<li>2.5 Gigabit Ethernet RJ-45.</li>
<li>HDMI 2.1 (4K 120Hz/8K 60Hz).</li>
</ul>
<p>So with it you get a reasonable amount of ports, that all work great and have a good fit with various connectors. The fun part though? The stand for your devices folds out from it. Making it easy to fold back and pack away for any travels you're doing. A bit of a novelty perhaps, but for anyone who does travel a fair bit, this will make it quite a nice space-saver for docking it wherever you go. The device connection cable also folds away into the device as well keeping it all safe and secure.</p>
<p>Having the device connector with a removable 90 degree USB-C adaptor is a nice touch too, if you're planning to hook it up to other devices when the stand is folded away, doubling it up as a decent USB HUB for other devices too. BenQ say the beCreatus GR10 will be plug and play across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux devices.</p>
<p>BenQ certainly aren't the first to have a stand that you pull out, I believe JSAUX got there first with their RGB Docking Station, but that's a little flimsy feeling and wobbly as it does not sit flat as there's a gap under it. Not a problem at here, as the designers at BenQ made sure the foldable stand actually folds out flat onto the surface. So it feels a lot sturdier than the competition. The build quality overall is fantastic too. Feels solid and looks nice while staying out of your way ‚Äî not much more is needed than that.</p>
<p>Other docks I've looked at before had ports that were a bit overly snug when connecting / disconnecting wires, which I'm pleased to say is not a problem here at all. The cuts for the ports are as snug as they should be, but not where it may cause issues.</p>
<p>I've been testing this constantly for about a week and a half now, and I haven't had a single problem with it. While I only have a Steam Deck to test with it, BenQ note it will fit and work well with other handhelds too including the ROG Ally, MSI Claw and the Legion Go thanks to the spacious 21.5mm size of the foldable stand.</p>
<p>You can see their own video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mlcIJgcMIyE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e7010d6b59efe8c5c66dedf6785de78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mlcIJgcMIyE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only downsides really are the <em>price</em> and <em>shipping</em>. At $109 it's a bit more than most other docks, and it seems they're only shipping in the USA right now. For the price though you get rather nice specifications and the useful foldable stand that sits nicely. I'll also say personally I think it's a bit <em>silly</em> that BenQ so prominently list 120Hz and 4K for it, despite the Steam Deck not performing well at 4K for really anything. But hey, that's great for other uses!</p>
<p>Overall this is easily one of the nicest docks I've had for review and I've been through quite a few now. For me personally it's going to be my own go-to for when travelling between places, which I actually do a fair bit of recently, so it came at a good time. And it actually works <em>better</em> than Valve's official dock, which I still at times have issues with displaying on my main TV whereas this as it should ‚Äî just works. You don't get a better recommendation than that right?</p>
<p>This is a premium dock with the price, build quality and ease of use to match with the added bonus of being good for travel. If you have yet to get a dock for your handheld, or you're looking for a <em>better</em> one, the BenQ beCreatus GR10 would be a great purchase that I'll happily recommend.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 3 fan game Project Borealis: Prologue gets a Steam page - due out soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Borealis is finally coming to Steam, to give you a taste of what Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2: Episode 3 could have been. A good time to do so, since we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>Created by a bunch of passionate fans they aim to give you a proper conclusion to Valve's popular FPS series. Built with Unreal Engine 5 they aim to create a faithful recreation of iconic Half-Life 2, although with plenty of upgrades. This is only a Prologue though, which is basically a demo.</p>
<p>I missed it but they did release a teaser trailer back in September:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dwdjgE74-98"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59783061bf438aa945bb6652c9d53f88.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dwdjgE74-98" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Legacy Continues</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the epic cliffhanger from Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Project Borealis represents a fan-made effort to realize a cohesive story conclusion to the episodic series. This prologue chapter invites players back into the HEV suit of Gordon Freeman, offering a glimpse into the next chapter of his journey.</p>
<p><strong>A Familiar Yet Different World</strong></p>
<p>Step into a Ravenholm transformed by time and the elements. The once-familiar town now lies buried under a blanket of snow, hiding the past and new present dangers beneath its pristine surface. As you navigate through this hauntingly beautiful landscape, you'll encounter some classic enemies reimagined and completely new secrets hidden within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers say it will be a "condensed, standalone game experience showcasing an early look and feel of the upcoming full Project Borealis game" with an original score to accompany it.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires Transport Tycoon from Chris Sawyer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari have announced they've now acquired Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon, as Atari continue building themselves back up.</p>
<p>This follows on from other acquisitions from Atari including the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/infogrames-atari-have-acquired-the-surgeon-simulator-franchise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Surgeon Simulator franchise under Infogrames</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intellivision brand and over 200 games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Night Dive Studios</a>.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We are honored that Chris has entrusted us with Transport Tycoon and our team is committed to both honoring and advancing his groundbreaking creation." said Atari Chairman and CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14930145311730737698gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Transport Tycoon, taken by me.</em></p>
<p>They said they plan to "expand digital and physical distribution, potentially develop new titles or content, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations as part of a long-term plan to preserve and expand this classic sim".</p>
<p>Makes sense for Atari to grab it since they were the publisher for Chris Sawyer's Locomotion too. On top of that Atari also currently control the licensing for RollerCoaster Tycoon as well, although they don't own it as Sawyer still does.</p>
<p>A bit of a colourful history between Sawyer and Atari though, as Sawyer actually sued Atari back in 2005 for unpaid royalties. Atari then counter-sued for damages in 2007, and later it was settled out of court in 2008 with an undisclosed sum paid to Sawyer.</p>
<p>Worth nothing that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/openttd-140-brings-a-scalable-font-a-new-ship-pathfinder-social-platform-integration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenTTD</a> exists, it's an open source simulation game based upon Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and it's pretty darn popular.</p>

      <title>New release of Raspberry Pi OS brings Wayland to all models with a new compositor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Raspberry Pi team have released a brand new version of the Raspberry Pi OS that brings with it Wayland support to all models.</p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-release-of-raspberry-pi-os/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've dropped their Wayland compositor called wayfire, and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/labwc/labwc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">labwc</a>, which is based on a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wlroots</a>. They say this project was a "much better fit for the Raspberry Pi graphics hardware" and when speaking to the developers they found "their future direction very much aligned with our own".</p>
<p>They've been working on it for most of this year in collaboration with the developers of both labwc and wlroots, and now it's reached the point where it runs just as fast as Xorg on older Raspberry Pi models and so the latest released Raspberry Pi OS runs Wayland by default across all models.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other improvements in this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improved support for using the Desktop with a touch screen.</li>
<li>Better Raspberry Pi Connect integration.</li>
<li>A better and rewritten panel application for the taskbar at the top of the screen.</li>
<li>A new Screen Configuration tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems 2025 will truly be the year of Wayland on Linux with most distributions and desktops now being in pretty good shape with it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3 will show when apps are killed due to out of memory (OOM)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues as always on the next version of the popular KDE Plasma desktop environment. My favourite desktop, and the one used for the Steam Deck Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>Developer Nate Graham also recently announced that the This Week in Plasma blog posts have moved to a new home. They're no longer going to be on their personal blog, instead actually on the official KDE blog system as noted in <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2024/11/02/this-week-in-plasma-spoooooky-ooooooooom-notifications/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the latest post</a>.</p>
<p>One new feature coming for Plasma 6.3 is that you will get nice clear notifications in the case of your system experiencing out of memory (OOM) where the Linux kernel terminated an app. Graham noted there's "now a little service to detect this and show you a system notification explaining what happened, plus suggestions for what you can do about it in the future". This sounds great to have.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5832418511730718961gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some other improvements noted to be coming include improvements to the Emoji Selector app to have "sub-string matching from the middle of words too, so you can find emojis more easily" due for Plasma 6.2.3. Additionally the grouping indicator for apps on the task manager bar will no longer always be green, and will instead follow your selected accent colour, this is due in Plasma 6.3.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4737823901730719070gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Plus as usual plenty of bug fixes are coming like XWayland-using apps acting weird when resizing them.</p>

      <title>Check out Proton-Sarek if you have an older GPU for Windows games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's work with Proton to run Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck is amazing, but they do require you have newer GPUs so some have been a bit left behind. Proton-Sarek aims to fix that.</p>
<p>What is it? A community built version of Proton (like GE-Proton) designed specifically for those of you who have a GPU that doesn't support newer Vulkan, or with no Vulkan support at all but still want all the latest updated from Proton to keep gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>As the developer explains on the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because there are still users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, as well as others with non-Vulkan support. Those who can use DXVK often rely on older Proton versions, which suffer from lower compatibility and performance compared to newer builds. Meanwhile, users dependent on WineD3D frequently face poor gaming experiences. This repository provides patched versions of Proton and/or Proton-GE, offering better performance with DXVK v1.10.3 and WineD3D mainly trough the custom parameter <code class="inline-code">PROTON_TWEAKS</code>, along with other enhancements, ensuring a smoother experience for both Vulkan and non-Vulkan setups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a nice idea for older systems. And much like GE-Proton, there's no support from Valve for this, but it's useful if you need it.</p>
<p>The developer recently released Sarek 9-18 and 9-17 with the base of the project updated to GE-Proton 9-17. On top of that it includes two new options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">PROTON_VK_SOFTWARE</code>: Uses Lavapipe to enable CPU-based rendering for Vulkan, supporting API version 1.3.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">PROTON_OGL_SOFTWARE</code>: Uses LLVMpipe to enable CPU-based rendering for OpenGL, supporting API version 4.6.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Linux Mint partners up with Framework, also working on Night Light for Cinnamon desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun Linux distro news for you this morning as the Linux Mint team have a fresh <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4762" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> up on what they've been doing and it's quite exciting to see.</p>
<p>The first thing is that for the Cinnamon desktop environment they're working on a Night Light feature. Previously they shipped Redshift but now they're working on one that's properly integrated, and plan for it to work with both Wayland and Xorg. On top of that they're also continuing the work to port key Cinnamon dialogs to Clutter.</p>
<p>A fun announcement in the post is that they've begun working with <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Framework</a>, who make the popular modular laptops. According to Mint lead Clement Lefebvre, Framework want "to achieve full compatibility with Linux Mint and the Cinnamon desktop" and their laptops are "packed with components we don‚Äôt have or technologies which we hadn‚Äôt really focused on yet" so it will "boost new areas of development for us". Lefebvre now has a Framework Laptop and seems to like it quite a lot.</p>

      <title>ASYLUM from Senscape finally has a release date - March 6, 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the successful crowdfunding for ASYLUM back in 2013, Senscape have been working away on the supernatural horror adventure and the spiritual successor to cult classic Scratches. Now it finally has a release date, so we're going to visit the ASYLUM on March 6th, 2025.</p>
<p>More about it: "ASYLUM is an ambitious and intricate first-person horror adventure casting you into the hallucinatory setting of the Hanwell Mental Institute. Interact with its curious denizens, gather clues, unravel the mystery, and march towards a shocking conclusion."</p>
<p>They even have a fresh trailer to celebrate the release date being announced:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A mind-bending original storyline that we somehow managed to keep secret during 15 years of production.</li>
<li>Between 10 and 15 hours of gameplay ‚Äî and that's without learning all the dark secrets!</li>
<li>An atmosphere so engrossing you will almost smell the stench of decrepitude and putrefaction around you.</li>
<li>Exciting challenges rewarding your wit and observation.</li>
<li>Memorable soundtrack inspired by 80s horror films and quite a bit of John Carpenter.</li>
<li>No jump scares! OK, maybe just a frightening handful that will hit you when you least expect them.</li>
<li>Diegetic interface and other buzz words.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Terraria hits over 60 million sales with Terraria 1.4.5 shaping up to be another big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest State of the Game developer <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-october-2024.139253/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> for Terraria gives out some big new sales numbers, and announces a new use for Life Fruit.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the subject of sales, Terraria has now crossed over 60 million (60.7m) with 33 million of those just on PC. Simply amazing, and it continues to be one of the most popular games on Steam as it's pretty much always in the top 100 most played games. It's in the top 100 over the last month and year specifically for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14487642851730545971gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for some announced changes the team revealed the new Jungle Juice, an upgraded healing potion for 180 points of health that can be crafted using Life Fruits in Hardmode. Good for those of you towards the end-game to keep you stocked up during some big battles.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot more coming in Terraria 1.4.5 that's being tracked in a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Upcoming_features" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wiki</a> including a Dead Cells crossover, new whips, new furniture sets, music blocks, transformation mounts, new accessories, a new film noir styled shader and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>No date is being given for Terraria 1.4.5 as they're continuing their mantra of "it's ready when it's ready".</p>
<p>Terraria has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Windows to Linux compatibility layer Wine 10.0 planned for mid-January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lead developer Alexandre Julliard <a href="https://list.winehq.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/wine-devel@winehq.org/thread/FVV5ZB7263Q5OIV5U4BUX6XPHF6WOGVT/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that Wine 10.0 is going to be releasing in mid-January 2025.</p>
<p>There's been a delay to the latest development build though, due to low activity and Julliard is travelling. So Wine 9.21 is instead coming out November 8th (instead of yesterday).</p>
<p>Two weeks after that, Wine 9.22 will be out and then another two weeks later on December 6, the first Release Candidate for Wine 10.0 will be available and mark the annual code freeze where the focus is purely on bugs and not new features.</p>
<p>That freeze will last until the final 10.0 release due "sometime around mid-January".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Wine 10.0 will have a lot of additions compared to Wine 9.0 like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Unicode.</li>
<li>Improved Wayland support.</li>
<li>Lots of DirectPlay support upgrades.</li>
<li>A new Media Foundation backend using FFMpeg.</li>
<li>ARM64 support upgrades.</li>
<li>An initial Driver Store implementation.</li>
<li>Expanded support for ODBC Windows drivers.</li>
<li>Support for elevating process privileges.</li>
<li>Better Dvorak keyboard detection.</li>
<li>And much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually then we will see a new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> version too based on Wine 10 to continue improving Windows gaming on Steam Deck / Linux from Steam.</p>

      <title>Linux hits exactly 2% user share on the October 2024 Steam Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out for October 2024, and the Linux user share has gone back up again to exactly 2%.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: 96.61% -0.23%</li>
<li>Linux 2.00% +0.13%</li>
<li>macOS: 1.39% +0.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite likely we're seeing the drop of Windows because the English language share overall went up by 8.09%, with Simplified Chinese dropping by 1%. We generally see the Linux share drop when Simplified Chinese on Steam rises, which it had done for two months in a row. So this seems like things going back to a more normal position.</p>

      <title>Stuck for what to play this weekend? DayZ works really nicely on Linux now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of something to game on Linux this weekend, why not try out the open-world survival game DayZ. The game is also going through a player surge thanks to a new expansion release.</p>
<p>The DayZ Frostline expansion launched October 15, and Bohemia Interactive announced it sold over 300,000 copies of the DLC in the first week. Along with that on October 20th they marked the best day ever with "501,522 total daily active users" and an all-time high on concurrent players "with 79,000 on Steam, 33,000 on PlayStation, and 36,000 on Xbox".</p>
<p>The thing is, I've been trying to play DayZ on and off for a while but always had issues with the launcher. Valve even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/more-battleye-titles-for-proton-on-linux-including-dayz-arma-3-now-supported/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in late 2021</a> that DayZ was one of the titles that enabled BattlEye anti-cheat support, ahead of the Steam Deck release. As of the latest DayZ update though? No problems at all getting into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1354828141730491948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1354828141730491948gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15530831761730492841gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15530831761730492841gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - DayZ on Linux, click pics to enlarge</em></p>
<p>Nice to see that some developers appear to have no problem with keeping their anti-cheat enabled for Linux unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online for GTA V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>The only issue I've encountered is that if you leave the game launcher open, you get a weird outline of it on top of the game window. Simply closing the launcher once you're in the game gets rid of it. Other than that on the latest Proton 9.0-3 it seems to work <em>really</em> nicely.</p>
<p>Pretty reasonable performance too on the Extreme graphics preset on 2560x1440 I've been seeing it run swimmingly over 60FPS all of the time in the open-world, and higher when in various buildings. Depends on the area though, some areas give much better performance.</p>
<p>DayZ is also 50% off until November 4th.</p>

      <title>Selaco gets a Special Campaign mode Beta adding a huge New Game+</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finished what's available so far for the excellent retro-inspired FPS Selaco? You may want to jump back in to test the Special Campaign mode Beta.</p>
<p>This new mode is their answer to what other games would call New Game+ giving you the option to replay the campaign with "unique endgame content and randomization, including new enemy types, a weapon rarity and trait system, random encounter mechanics, and more" which sounds pretty awesome.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-17 and 9-18 out now with various upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's two new versions of GE-Proton that have been released in the last day, although it's mostly just updating components from upstream to continue to improve Windows games on Linux platforms including Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For GE-Proton 9-17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:<br/>
-wine updated to latest bleeding edge<br/>
-dxvk updated to latest git<br/>
-vkd3d-proton updated to latest git<br/>
-dxvk-nvapi updated to latest git<br/>
-ICU building + linking imported from upstream<br/>
-misc proton script fixes imported from upstream</p>
<p>Protonfixes:<br/>

-Fix typo'd mod support for ES: Oblivion (thanks MaxBosse)<br/>
-Disable esync/fsync in Disgaea 4 to prevent crash (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing)</p>
<p>Nothing major here, just a refresh of various parts that need updates from git, mostly to add new video playback fixes from upstream proton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4763709421730481762gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em></p>
<p>And then GE-Proton 9-18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add missing proton script python uuid import (which broke prefix creation)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Taken from the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> releases page.</em></p>
<p>A lot of their work right now is going into Open Wine Components like UMU, the unified launcher for Windows games on Linux, which allows the likes of GE-Proton to run properly outside of Steam for use in tools like Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and other launchers. The creator, Thomas Crider, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ubuntu-summit-2024-highlights-linux-gaming-talks-on-umu-and-heroic-launcher/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently did a talk at the Ubuntu Summit</a> you should check out.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered may need a workaround on desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is out now and like other recent Sony PlayStation releases on PC, it forces a PlayStation Network Account which is causing issues for some desktop Linux players.</p>
<p>You can run it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, but you might have issues actually logging into the PSN account system to play it. Not particularly surprising, since with<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> God of War Ragnar√∂k</a> you needed to pretend your desktop Linux system was a Steam Deck but in this case you <em>don't</em> want to do that.</p>
<p>Writing on the Steam forum, a developer at Nixxes Software <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/0/4634860082274840611/#c4634860082274843235" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said to do this</a> instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SteamDeck parameter includes other changes specifically designed for the Steam Deck.<br/>
If you are experiencing issues with the login flow on Linux, please use the following workaround:<br/>
<br/>
On Steam, right click the game in your Library, choose Properties, go to General.<br/>
Add <strong>-showlinkingqr</strong> in the field for Launch Options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see this sort of thing has been thought about, and to have a developer directly reply with a solution.</p>

      <title>Black Mesa has a new Beta with &#39;WAY better&#39; support for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective have a fresh Beta available for Black Mesa, their fan-made reimagining of Valve Software's Half-Life. This brings with it some nice improvements all across the game, especially for Linux platforms like Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/362890/view/4486241294570487809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned "Welcome to Fall, and a Black Mesa beta patch post! We have pushed a build to public-beta that includes a bunch of fixes to some lingering issues, and WAY better Linux/Steam Deck support" with these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved game start up for a smother first time launch and improved stability.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the game to crash to the menu when changing video settings during gameplay.</li>
<li>Fixed performance issue with moving wires (Thanks to npc_pigeon, narkvic, and the community).</li>
<li>Re-added DXVK for Windows as a launch option.</li>
<li>Significantly better native Linux implementation and Steam Deck support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12565454981730400051gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They go into quite a lot more detail on all the changes too, which is nice to see. We often see developers note improvements, but not many go deep into the individual details. Specifically for Linux here's everything they listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ToGL/Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated ToGL/Linux shaders with the latest GBuffer changes to ensure the application of up-to-date rendering techniques.</li>
<li>Cleaned up the shadow filter state in ToGL/Linux, resulting in more accurate and stable shadow rendering.</li>
<li>Migrated ToGL/Linux to use the OpenGL 3.3 Compatibility Profile, enhancing compatibility with a broader range of hardware and driver configurations while maintaining access to modern OpenGL features.</li>
<li>Introduced an optional experimental Binary Shader Cache for ToGL/Linux, accessible via the -glusebinarycache command line option on Linux and native Steam Deck builds, which improves shader load times on supported platforms.</li>
<li>Resolved a half-pixel halo issue in the ToGL/Linux rendering pipeline, improving visual accuracy in rendered scenes.</li>
<li>Added per-triangle and optional per-vertex validation for studio models to resolve issues in ToGL/Linux related to static and dynamically lit models. A second pass for per-vertex validation can be enabled via the +r_studio_validate_vertices 1 command line argument.</li>
<li>Improved lighting buffer quality on ToGL/Linux to resolve a red hue in specular highlights, ensuring consistent visual output across platforms.</li>
<li>Added a missing window icon on ToGL/Linux to address a minor visual issue.</li>
<li>Configured default arguments for the Linux launcher to optimize display settings on Steam Deck, ensuring a better out-of-the-box experience for AMD/Intel GPU users.</li>
<li>Fixed debug assertions in Havok that leaked into the release build on Linux, preventing potential crashes during runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proton/Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced the shipped DXVK configuration on Proton if no overrides are provided, enhancing compatibility with Proton 9.x and newer versions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For some background: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/ToGL" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ToGL</a> is the original translation layer Valve used in their earlier Linux ports, that translated Direct3D to OpenGL. Later Valve games have native Vulkan support, and they also nowadays of course have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> with DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for translating Direct3D to Vulkan.</p>
<p>That's a rather surprising amount of effort that's been put into the Native Linux version of the game.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania is out now and it&#39;s a huge expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC is out now and it's a rather large addition to an already great game. <em>Note: DLC key provided by Future Friends Games, the base game I purchased myself originally.</em></p>
<p>Taking an already fantastic content-filled game and just giving you a whole lot more of it, what's not to love about Vampire Survivors? Accessible action that you can hop into for a run whenever you want, and now there's a healthy dose of Castlevania too? Yes please.</p>
<p>It probably needs no real introduction right? Vampire Survivors spawned a whole genre with its simple mechanics of building up a crazy character with auto-firing attacks. Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania adds in over 20 new characters, 40 new weapons, over 30 new music tracks and a huge new castle map to battle through. That's only really scratching the surface of this monstrous expansion though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RnzmiDonN2E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8843e1edff4652e79b2f3644e4ae6bfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RnzmiDonN2E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The themed map is a nice addition to the game and quite different from most of the maps. With a mixture of closed and open areas, with plenty of extras in it to find and unlock. Unlike other maps, it also has dedicated spots to spawn various Castlevania themed bosses so you can take them on when you feel you're powered up enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594656041730398248gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594656041730398248gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While the map is nice the real weight of the DLC comes down to all the characters and weapons, but it will take you a good while to get through it all. We're talking tens of hours of gameplay here on the normal speed to battle through the bosses, and deal with the challenges to unlock all the new characters.</p>
<p>I won't spoil it, but lets just say that they're <em>massively</em> underselling this DLC thanks to a big secret. There's a <strong>lot</strong> more to it than what they're telling you. No doubt you'll be able to find what easily somewhere else, but I'm not a fan of ruining a very nice surprise that really was awesome to see. I have no doubt this will bump the game back up the most played lists on Steam and for good reason.</p>
<p>All the usual jank of Vampire Survivors with enemies walking on top of all the walls, while in other sections they all get stuck on them. It's the game you know and love, just more of everything.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC is a brilliant addition to the game, and one that is really a no-brainer on recommending you pick up. The price ($3.99 / EUR 3.99 / ¬£2.99) for the content is just absurd, poncle really did some great stuff here.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified, and has Native Linux support (although not advertised).</p>

      <title>EA / Respawn now block Apex Legends from running on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of Apex Legends have announced that they're going to be blocking the game completely on Linux platforms including Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1852019667315102151" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X / Twitter I'll copy it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Legends,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we‚Äôre battling cheaters‚Äîthis is one to add to the list. We remain committed to more regular updates on topics like this and appreciate your continued reports.</p>
<p>Read on to hear from our Anti-Cheat Team.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What‚Äôs happening?</p>
<p>In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game.</p>
<p>Linux is used by default on the Steam Deck. There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux).</p>
<p>Decision making process</p>
<p>The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers. Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it‚Äôs on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention.</p>
<p>We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players‚Äô games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>To eliminate this cheat vector, we have made the decision to prevent access to the game for Linux users. This means that Apex Legends will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system. Playing on handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows.</p>
<p>To clarify, this will not impact users who play Apex via Steam on Windows (or other supported platforms).</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone‚Äôs continual support and we look forward to sharing future anti-cheat updates!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is only a part of our ongoing efforts towards Apex‚Äôs anti-cheat. We are continually expanding and refining our detection and banning capabilities globally. Keep an eye out for more news to come in the future. Please continue to report cheaters using <a href="https://help.ea.com/no/help/apex-legends/apex-legends/report-player-apex-legends/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the designated tools and channels</a>. Your reports are helpful and matter to us and anti-cheat continues to be a top priority for us.</p>
<p>For future updates and the latest info, continue to follow us here or check out the <a href="https://trello.com/b/ZVrHV38P/apex-tracker" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Apex Tracker Trello</a> for bugs or concerns we‚Äôre investigating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve are really going to need to do something more about the anti-cheat situation on Linux. We only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had GTA Online in GTA V blocked</a> (single-player still works). EA also broke the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-anti-cheat-arrives-for-battlefield-1-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 1</a> and various other multiplayer games as well on Linux / Steam Deck, and I did say it was likely only a matter of time until EA messed with Apex. The list of blocked titles just keeps going like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox</a> too ‚Äî it's just a repeating problem that seems to have no end in sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3288417851730392752gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Soon then the official Steam Deck rating from Valve will drop from Playable to Unsupported. <em><strong>Update 18:16 UTC</strong> - Valve have now marked it as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>When you try to play on a Linux platform now, you're just given an anti-cheat message. So this is the end of Apex Legends on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10408696591730393051gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How much of a loss is it? Well, for Apex fans on Linux platforms it will of course be a <em>big</em> one. However, looking at Valve's own stats, Apex isn't actually in the Top 100 for the last month of most played games on Steam Deck. The past year though? It's number #48 overall.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you suddenly go "but‚Ä¶but Microsoft are banning kernel-level anti-cheat!" ‚Äî no they're not. Various YouTube videos and other media made headlines about it, but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they're wrong which I wrote about before</a>. Even <em>if</em> in some far-away future Microsoft managed to do so, companies will still block Linux directly if they wanted to (and they already do like Roblox!).</p>
<p>In related news, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only announced yesterday</a> that Steam store pages will need to properly note what kernel-level anti-cheat they use.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck the &#39;perfect platform&#39; for their game say Escape From Castle Matsumoto devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape From Castle Matsumoto looks like quite a unique one, and the developers give the Steam Deck some rather high praise. It's releasing with Native Linux support on December 5th.</p>
<p>In the game two shinobis race against each other to recover stolen items and escape a Japanese castle, using your wits and tricks to outsmart your opponent. What makes it interesting is the split-screen mechanic, along with the slick retro pixel-artwork that looks like it was inspired by the classic Spy vs. Spy.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H3PsS55E2FY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe6043758f9f51ff4fa7675e6d923eb0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H3PsS55E2FY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2490030/announcements/detail/4541409756166750375" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said: "Escape From Castle Matsumoto will be 100% Steam Deck compatible, including an official input layout. In fact, Steam Deck will be THE perfect platform for our game."</p>
<p>Could be a good one to keep an eye on!</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">You will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>thoroughly search the castle to locate and collect all items</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hinder your opponent's efforts by setting up tricks and obstacles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if necessary, challenge your opponent in a direct fight</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Use all of your shinobi training to accomplish the mission:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ninja's tools: locks and smoke bombs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>powerful spirits you can summon to guard items and passages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>defensive remedies to break tricks set up by your opponent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>martial arts if a direct confrontation becomes inevitable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Play against the CPU or another player, over split-screen or network.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud now has a proper tutorial</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearing up for the final 1.0 release on December 5, the sci-fi fantasy epic roguelike Caves of Qud now has a proper tutorial released.</p>
<p>You still have to wait for the 1.0 release for the end of the main story though, but at least now you can jump right in and get a proper good idea of what to do. I suggest you do too, because it's a fantastic game that is at times completely absurd in what you can do and what your character can become.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87TKcq4tcJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52258000d8bb63ab7374b84c18b68a7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87TKcq4tcJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've gone through and tested the tutorial, and it really is a nice introduction to the game. Since it's a huge roguelike though, it does only scratch the surface of what the game is about and what you can do. Does the job well though and works great on Linux.</p>
<p>The price, as they previously announced, has also now risen to ¬£24.99 / $29.99 / ‚Ç¨28.99.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> ‚Äî Don‚Äôt like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> ‚Äî Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> ‚Äî Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> ‚Äî Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> ‚Äî Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> ‚Äî Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ATMOSPHERIC ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK</strong> ‚Äî Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</p>

      <title>Steam games will now need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat on store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a change for Steam today that will make things a lot clearer for everyone, as developers will now need to clearly list the kernel-level anti-cheat used on Steam store pages.</p>
<p>In the Steamworks Developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> Valve said: "We've heard from more and more developers recently that they're looking for the right way to share anti-cheat information about their game with players. At the same time, players have been requesting more transparency around the anti-cheat services used in games, as well as the existence of any additional software that will be installed within the game."</p>
<p>Developers with games already on Steam will also need to do this, as it's not just for new games coming up for release, and it is also part of the release process now too. So Valve will be doing checks on games to ensure the notices are there and correct.</p>
<p>However, it's only being <em>forced</em> for kernel-level anti-cheat. If it's only client-side or server-side, it's <em>optional</em>, but Valve say "we generally think that any game that makes use of anti-cheat technology would benefit from letting players know".</p>
<p>Valve's example pictured below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7927772011730316555gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some games don't properly remove everything when you uninstall either, with Valve noting this happens with older games, so it's nice to also see this will be noted too.</p>
<p>This should make it a bit easier knowing what to avoid on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux now too, since kernel-level anti-cheat games are usually blocked by the developer from running with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Valve have done a few rather interesting Steam updates lately like dealing with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publisher banner spam</a>, implementing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements for Native Linux games</a>, actually noting clearly when you go to purchase a game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-purchases-now-clearly-state-youre-just-getting-a-license-not-ownership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's just a license</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-subscriber-agreement-updated-for-disputes-removing-the-need-for-individual-arbitration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing the need for individual arbitration</a>.</p>

      <title>Luma Island devs spent an &#39;enormous amount of effort&#39; to make it smooth on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luma Island looks pretty sweet from Feel Free Games, a game that combines together elements of adventuring and building together that you can play solo or with up to 4 people together.</p>
<p>In a post on Steam the developers mentioned "For any up and coming adventurers that were hoping to play Luma Island on the go, we have got you covered! We have spent an enormous amount of effort ensuring that everything runs smoothly on the Steam Deck, allowing you to farm, fish and explore on the move."</p>
<p>Additionally they said they plan to keep improving it after release. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>

<p>Of course since it's being optimized for Steam Deck, this means thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton </a>it will then also work well on desktop Linux with your favourite distro!</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s end of year fundraiser is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you appreciate the work from the KDE team on things like the Plasma desktop environment, maybe it's time to give them a little donation. KDE are looking to raise at least ‚Ç¨30,000 with the total being updated each day.</p>
<p>This time around they've given the page a special Halloween theme with some short stories about issues with proprietary software. They're just a little reminder of what can happen like licenses being pulled away, companies using your work to train their AI, Windows updates being forced while you're working and more. Some truly horrifying stuff there.</p>
<p>From the fundraising page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're kicking off our 2024 end-of-year fundraiser just in time for Halloween!</p>
<p>Even if the spine-tingling horrors of the long dark night of Walpurgis are mostly imaginary, the sinister threats of predatory proprietary software providers remain all too real.</p>
<p>Fear not! We, the KDE community, will help you, your friends, family, company, and community banish all the creepy and insidious proprietary software that haunts your computers, phones, and household appliances.</p>
<p>But we can't do it alone! We need you to help us fight the good fight against the tech-ghouls from beyond. Use the form to donate any amount to our fundraiser (or become a regular donor to our community) and help us keep the dark forces of proprietary software at bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See all on <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their fundraising platform</a>.</p>
<p>KDE Plasma is my favourite desktop environment, I would honestly feel a bit lost without it on Linux nowadays. It's nice on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode too. I just recently updated Kubuntu from 24.04 to 24.10 as well, getting all that Wayland goodness from a much more recent Plasma version has been fun to test.</p>

      <title>Bazzite updated to Fedora 41 with expanded PC gaming handheld support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite Linux has seen an upgrade to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/fedora-41-is-out-now-with-plenty-of-enhancements-like-easier-nvidia-driver-installs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just released Fedora 41</a>, and with it comes lots of extra enhancements to their support of various PC gaming handhelds from AYANEO, ROG Ally and others.</p>
<p>What is Bazzite? It's "a cloud native image built upon Fedora Atomic Desktops that brings the best of Linux gaming to all of your devices - including your favorite handheld". Basically, it's a SteamOS-like based on Fedora that can turn your Windows handhelds into a smooth Linux device.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Bazzite F41 update they've got an updated Linux kernel v6.11 that includes patches for Ayaneo, OneXPlayer, Ayn, basic controller support for the MSI Claw and a whole lot more goodies. Some of these changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker patches for Ayaneo Geek, Geek 1S, 1S, 2, 2S, Kun, Flip KB, Flip DS, and Ayn Loki MiniPro.</li>
<li>Display quirks for Ayaneo Flip DS, Neo 2S, GEEK, Founder edition and Ayaneo 2.</li>
<li>ROG Ally has a new patch that "selects the correct firmware for the Ally speakers, offering superior performance for users that used the incorrect firmware previously".</li>
<li>OneXPlayer X1 and X1 Mini sensors driver updated with "support for charge limiting and charge bypass" plus allowing control of the Turbo LED.</li>
<li>The MSI Claw also had support added to the "Handheld Daemon, where the front OEM buttons and the controller will work properly in Steam Gaming Mode". Lots of work still needed there though as there's plenty missing like TDP controls and back buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of background work on the Bazzite project as a whole too. Bazzite has grown massively recently, with even the likes of Digital Foundry giving it a spin showing how it can improve on the mess of Windows on handhelds:</p>

      <title>Fedora 41 is out now with plenty of enhancements like easier NVIDIA driver installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora 41 is officially out now and brings with it plenty of upgrades for all users. Here's just some of what's new and improved.</p>
<p>If you stick with Fedora Workstation you'll get the newer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/gnome-47-denver-released-with-accent-colours-and-various-system-enhancements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 47</a> that comes with lots of additions I covered before like accent colour customization, enhanced small screen support, an improved Files app, a better Online Accounts system and much more.</p>
<p>Specifically in Fedora 41 there's IPU6 Camera support and improvements for Traditional Chinese. A big one is support for installing Nvidia drivers with secureboot, although the process needs a few steps it's good to see it in. There's also a new terminal app with Ptyxis.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5173878781730288226gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora 41</em></p>
<p>There's also the newer DNF 5 package manager, PHP is 64-bit only, Valkey replaces Redis, PipeWire camera sensor support in Firefox and upgrades to various included applications.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Fedora KDE got some nice upgrades too like<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/kde-plasma-62-released-with-improved-wayland-colour-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> KDE Plasma 6.2</a> that has improved Wayland colour management, lots of enhancements for drawing tablets, overhauled accessibility options and so on. There's also a new KDE Plasma Mobile spin.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds plenty of Game Recording improvements plus a Steam Play update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve rolled out another two Steam Client Beta updates recently, as they continue pushing the Game Recording system towards a stable release. The fixes are the same for Steam Deck and Desktop since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>From the update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4507632758953083307?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 28th</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the names of manually added or removed games not appearing in the collection filter header if the game had been removed from the user's library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced clip export/share time in many cases when exporting native resolution, codec, and frame rate.</li>
<li>Added ability to start/stop recording of a clip via manual recording shortcut key, when in background recording mode.</li>
<li>Updated desktop toast notifications during game recording to show clipping action and depict clip duration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4507632758953083387?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 29th</a>, which also has an adjustment of Steam Play for third party compatibility tools (like GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda and others):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed steamwebhelper deleting temp directories that it may not have previously created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended the "auto" quality setting, which sets the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution, into four levels: low, medium, high and ultra. These replace the prior fixed bit rate quality settings. See the quality setting dialog for more info.</li>
<li>Improved the speed of exporting a file in some scenarios.</li>
<li>Recording video with AMD GPUs should now use a higher H264 codec profile setting.</li>
<li>Improved navigation of Game Recording Settings in Big Picture</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend recent Steam Play fixes to third party compatibility tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's been a few adjustments to Steam Play recently like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-removes-option-to-globally-disable-steam-play-plus-game-recording-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing the global toggle</a> to turn it off, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using a newer container runtime</a> instead of the legacy environment for better compatibility overall.</p>
<p>How long do we think before Game Recording rolls out in a stable update? How are you getting on with it? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Beelink have open-sourced their Multi-Functional EX Docking Station for mini PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor Beelink have "open-sourced" their Multi-Functional EX Docking Station that you can use to extend their GTi Ultra Series mini PCs with a full GPU.</p>
<p>I can't find anywhere that lists a <em>specific</em> license, so it may not be OSI approved "open source" by their definition of it but they are being very open about it and their promise includes the patents too. Seems like they want it to become a standard of some sort, which would benefit them too. If more and more vendors decided to use it, that would make them eventually easier and cheaper to produce with more options.</p>

      <title>Speedollama is an ultra fast, violent and silly platformer-shooter out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from Chaosmonger Studio who created ENCODYA, Clunky Hero, Three Minutes To Eight and other games is a new release with Speedollama. <em>Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you enjoyed games like Metal Slug, Contra and other classic action-platformers, you'll probably love this one quite a lot. It's ridiculous in all the best ways, but still very much on the simple side mechanically overall. Speedollama, as the name suggests, is all about <em>speed</em>. You race through the generated levels to collect items to unlock the exit against the timer, blowing up every single alpaca that's in your way and watching all their pixel bodies explode into tiny pieces.</p>
<p>Making you feel like a speed-runner, although with procedurally generated levels, you get to choose from 3 different characters each with slightly different stats. As you progress through you will also be able to purchase a few character buffs to make it just that little bit more crazy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EYFWldXi1bo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd730858a46150fd1b096d0db71db9a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EYFWldXi1bo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said how it "pushes the limits of the run-and-gun genre" and they're not wrong. I had to take a few breaks, just because of the speed of it all to allow my mind to catch up a bit. Run, gun, bounce around chaotically and keep on running some more. Reminded me a fair bit of Broforce, without the environmental destruction, with the sprinkle of comedy too.</p>
<p>Speedollama is just totally absurd. You can't help but smile as you run through it.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels offering endless replayability.</li>
<li>Vibrant, coloured pixel-art graphics with hand-made frame-by-frame animations.</li>
<li>Fantasy violence with humorous splatter scenes and gallons of pixelated blood.</li>
<li>A variety of weapons and upgrades to enhance gameplay.</li>
<li>Extremely fast-paced action for adrenaline-fueled fun.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage gets improved Steam Deck support and now rated Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubisoft gave a very small update to Assassin's Creed Mirage on Steam and managed to get it bumped up to a Steam Deck Playable rating. <em>The rating and update went live today.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect much though, they didn't make any specific upgrades to the game. Here's what they announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game will automatically detect your Steam Deck and will run default settings for better performances on this device. We recommend keeping using the proposed presets to smoothly experience Basim's coming of age story on your Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this is absolute minimum-level effort stuff. They haven't announced any plans to improve it elsewhere, so that may be the best we get for it.</p>
<p>Why is it rated Playable? First up: Ubisoft Connect (that's required) has issues where you may be forced to use the touch screen and it may have small text. On top of that you will need to <em>manually</em> bring up the keyboard any time it's needed, some in-game text is too small and the game will also not exit clean so you have to force close it when you're done as you get left with a black screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19171083541730218978gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's a bit of fun behind the scenes info for you: surprisingly, Ubisoft sent a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>. However, it came with a major problem. I <em>couldn't</em> actually play Assassin's Creed Mirage at all. I'll give you one guess as to why. It was due to Ubisoft Connect ‚Äî what a surprise! Did you guess correctly? I bet you did.</p>
<p>Even though Ubisoft release their games on Steam now, and will be going back to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-and-star-wars-outlaws-head-to-steam-as-ubisoft-return-to-same-day-releases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same-day releases</a> for future titles, they still use their additional launcher. Not just that, it <em>also</em> needs a special activation code (like a CD Key). For Steam purchases this is done in the form of a DLC. For Steam Curator keys, initially this activation code DLC was <em>not</em> actually linked up.</p>
<p>I spoke to Ubisoft Support, who gave me the usual unhelpful runaround of not actually reading what I wrote. Ubisoft Press <em>didn't</em> even reply and Valve support initially gave the usual unhelpful didn't-read-it reply too. 3 days later, the activation code DLC was suddenly in my Steam Library. Steam support then replied again that same day, to note basically "you're wrong, it's there" ‚Äî well of course because someone did fix it. Who? I'll apparently never know. <em>Update: Ubisoft press did reply, after the article was published, but it's solved now anyway.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat a unique situation being a Steam Curator, but just another in the list of why these extra launchers can be a nuisance. 3 days of waiting on it‚Ä¶</p>

      <title>Ubuntu Summit 2024 highlights - Linux gaming talks on UMU and Heroic Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Ubuntu Summit 2024 has been and gone, and with it we had a lot of good talks but with our focus on here with gaming there's two that stand out that you may wish to have a look at. <em>Currently the talks haven't been split up so they're across three big livestreams.</em></p>
<p>On Day 2 there was a <a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/580/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Pawe≈Ç Lidwin of the Heroic Games Launcher project, a cross-platform free and open source launcher for Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Prime Games. The talk gives a brief overview on what they've been working on like UWP/WinRT in Wine, Comet for GOG multiplayer features and more. But Lidwin also does a quick little sneak peek intro on a new project called Maxima Launcher, an open source replacement for EA Desktop / Origin that will eventually get Heroic integration too.</p>
<p>Skip to 8:43:32 for the Heroic talk:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNK4aSv-krI?rel=0&amp;start=31410"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92bd9d3153728cdc2de20533101aa2b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNK4aSv-krI?rel=0&amp;start=31410" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Then on Day 3 we had a <a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/510/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Thomas Crider, also known as <em>GloriousEggroll</em>, who made GE-Proton (originally called Proton-GE) on the creation of UMU the unified launcher for Windows games on Linux. It's a nice overview for people confused on how UMU works and what it's actually for. The talk goes over how Steam actually runs games on Linux, and how UMU deals with running Proton outside of Steam along with the UMU Database that has a bunch of game-specific tweaks to run them properly.</p>
<p>For this one skip to 1:03:34:</p>

      <title>AYANEO continue teasing the AYANEO 3 Code: REVO handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While still giving us no actual details, AYANEO are hyping up the AYANEO 3 Code: REVO handheld that's due to be announced properly sometime soon. Their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ayaneo-tease-the-ayaneo-3-as-a-revolution-and-a-completely-new-concept/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial announcement</a> was just marketing speak word-salad, and ‚Äî surprise, this <a href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/857" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest</a> isn't really any different.</p>
<p>They're saying it's "not just a product of technological innovation, it is also an awakening of product thinking" whatever that means. And it will bring "not only hardware innovation, but also a deeper change in the way players interact with their handhelds". Once again, it's like they picked a bunch of buzzwords, put them on a board and threw darts at it to pick out things to say. They continued to note how they aren't just "looking for a faster and more powerful device" but are also "exploring the boundaries of the AYANEO handheld gaming experience". Okay then.</p>
<p>Going by the teaser pictures they included, it's very much a traditional handheld shell design, so it's not exactly that much of a revolution. But, there's only so much you can do with handheld PC designs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3797216291730197813gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3797216291730197813gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11555724631730197814gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11555724631730197814gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>From that second teaser image, it looks a lot like the Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>They touched on how previous handhelds have "many trade-offs and compromises among portability, performance, control, battery life and experience" and claim that the "AYANEO 3 brings a new level of freedom, a technological leap, and a conceptual revolution and sublimation, allowing us to say goodbye to the constraints and welcome more possibilities".</p>
<p>Hopefully Bazzite and other Linux versions can get support for whatever it turns out to be nice and quick.</p>

      <title>90s horror adventure game Clock Tower: Rewind released outside Japan for the first time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clock Tower released originally in 1995 for the SNES and later for other systems, but it was never officially translated and supported outside of Japan until now with Clock Tower: Rewind. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play this one on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Not one I'm actually familiar with directly so I'll let the official blurb speak: "Turn back the clock for one of the pioneers of the survival-horror genre. Translated and released outside of Japan for the first time, Clock Tower: Rewind is a revival of the terror-inducing 16-bit classic that dares you to explore the haunting confines of the Barrows family manor. As teenage orphan Jennifer, you must search every disturbing corner to find items, reveal secrets, and discover ways to evade Scissorman, a murderous, unstoppable, shears-wielding psychopath."</p>
<p>Gameplay trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdV1kzvyr9w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc6518f1763fb38cb0f4c9304960c7dc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdV1kzvyr9w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The survival-horror classic, Clock Tower, officially translated and brought out of Japan for the first time</li>
<li>Choose from Original mode or Rewind mode, which features numerous gameplay additions and quality-of-life refinements</li>
<li>Run, hide, and survive as you attempt to evade the psychotic Scissorman</li>
<li>Atmospheric 2D art, detailed animations, and haunting sound effects augment the tense point-and-click gameplay</li>
<li>Multiple endings and randomized gameplay elements maximize replayability (and jump scares)</li>
<li>New animated opening, motion-comics with VO, and vocal theme song performed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</li>
<li>Featuring an art gallery, music player, behind-the-scenes creator interview, save states, and other modern inclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see more classics available to a wider audience.</p>

      <title>Men of War II finally gets an offline mode with a big content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Men of War II from Best Way originally released back in May, but it forced an online connection. With the Steel Rain update out now that's no longer the case. Nice to see the developer actually deliver on what they promised.</p>
<p>You can now switch between offline and online modes and additionally the developer added the ability for all single-player modes to have the option to change the game speed. They also mentioned how "the quality of the game world simulation will now improve based on the power of your PC" as well. They also said they expect almost everyone to notice "a somewhat less ‚Äúarcadey‚Äù feel of the game". Online play had some tweaks too like an improved MMR score calculation, which they feel is a "significant improvement".</p>
<p>New content too like 8 new units and 3 new battalions, plus updated models for a bunch of existing ones. Some new visual effects are in, new blood effects, particle reflections in water, particles got shadows, smooth fading of light sources at a distance and lots more. There's also new and improved sound effects, unit balancing and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Set comfort level to maximum with the Mechanism Gaming Pillow for handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may remember Mechanism from their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original Deckmate</a> system of attachments for the Steam Deck, but they have since expanded to cover other handhelds and they also now have the Mechanism Gaming Pillow.</p>
<p>For full disclosure: the Mechanism team sent it over a while ago for review, and it has become something I now use without even thinking about ‚Äî it just makes sense. If I'm not going to be docking it, and I'm sat where I can sit back and relax a bit, I will absolutely be popping the Steam Deck into it without question.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't even remotely convinced until actually getting it and using it for a while. Why? Just the very idea of a gaming pillow never really appealed much to me. I thought it would be gimmicky, or just a fancy pillow with the word gaming attached to bring up the price. Thankfully, the Gaming Pillow from Mechanism is actually a genuinely good idea.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21002292951730129889gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Image credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>Here's the thing: I play on my Steam Deck near-enough every day. A lot of the time, I prop my arms up with some sort of pillow underneath anyway. At times on my sofa building something resembling a pillow fort just to get properly comfy for a decent gaming session. Why? The dreaded aching arms, and slightly sore neck that can come with holding it up for a while.</p>
<p><em>Mechanism's Gaming Pillow solves the entire problem and then some. </em></p>
<p>It's super simple to attach it together. All you need for the Steam Deck is the Deckmate mount that you just slot over the top of the Steam Deck, and then you just click it into the arm mount on the Gaming Pillow. The Gaming Pillow can be purchased with a mount for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally / X, Nintendo Switch, and there's also adaptors for the dbrand and JSAUX cases plus there's a universal grip to stick it to anything else.</p>
<p>From there, you can then position it pretty much whichever way you want with the pillow sat on top of you. This is thanks to the ball socket attached to the end of the arm, allowing you to really get it where you want it. So even if you're tall, or you have short arms, or you're just generally short (hi) it's not an issue getting it into position.</p>
<p>It entirely frees up your arms to game for longer sessions without worry. Maybe you want to quickly check your phone or have a sip of your coffee or whatever without dropping the Deck itself or moving it anywhere. It will just sit there floating in the mount waiting for you. There's even an extra mount directly on the top of it for you to stick down a battery pack, a USB hub, your phone or whatever else you might need while relaxing with your handheld.</p>
<p>While I think it's great, there is <em>one</em> thing that annoys me about it. The material and coating on the top where you rest the Steam Deck (if you have it set down low) is a bit squeaky with any movement of the attachment rubbing on it. Not overly distracting, but still just a tiny bit annoying. Other than that, it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>I would have liked to have more to say about it, but there's not a lot of extra I can add in here that wouldn't just end up as nonsense text-padding. It does exactly what it advertises, and does so very nicely. I no longer have to build up a little pillow fort under my arms to get comfy and that's wonderful.</p>
<p>You're still going to look a fair bit silly with it though but who really cares when you're the master of comfort.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/gaming-pillow" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Mechanism website</a>. It's being done in batches with the next expected in November.</p>

      <title>Albion Online &#39;Horizons&#39; update brings a customizable HUD and a more dynamic world</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the few actually popular MMOs that has official Native Linux support, Albion Online has expanded again today with the Horizons update out now.</p>
<p>This sandbox MMO update brings with it a customizable HUD with a built-in HUD editor so you can move everything around to where you want it. You can also save and share your layouts with the ability to have 10 saved at a time for different activities.</p>
<p>The world should feel a bit more interesting too with dynamic encampments to find as you explore for both solo and group play with some valuable loot. You might also find a special map which gives you access to a special boss lair to fight through. There's also dynamic resource hotspots, you might now find valuable coffers to open up across the open world, a new portal system for solo players to jump to unpredictable locations for easier exploration in the Outlands and a lot more.</p>

<p>Albion Online has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. It has a pretty healthy number of players too. On Steam alone in the last 24 hours it had a peak of 12,842 which does not count the standalone launcher players or mobile players (all play together cross-platform).</p>

      <title>Create completely ridiculous weapons in survive-em-up roguelite shooter NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor on the surface may look just like yet another survivor-like, but it has captured my total attention in a way not many have been able to. It's just thoroughly great. <em>Note: key provided by Fiveamp.</em></p>
<p>Much like all the others in the genre that spawned from Vampire Survivors it has the basics: repeated runs where you take down enemies, while you collect little experience orbs to level up. Here though, you're also building a gun as you go through various attachments (that they call augments). What you can end up with is totally <em>ridiculous</em> and I love the way you see your attachments represented in the weapon itself on-screen as you run around. Although I do hope they expand on this visually, as some attachments don't change the look at all. <em>A bit like how Brotato evolves your character's look as you go.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f09L7Uy5xII"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c93de2b73a7dbde6c9b66f40615c602.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f09L7Uy5xII" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot that sets this apart from other games in the genre too that I'll go over a few bits of now. For starters: the level up system. Here it's not completely automatic. When you reach a level up, a pod will drop down you have to run to collect. Even that can be a little challenging at times, due to the amount of enemy swarms you might be dealing with. It's also just a supremely cool idea to have a pod drop down to buff your weapon with some new attachments.</p>
<p>When you die, the weapon you've built <em>won't</em> just vanish either. You go back to your little home base, where the weapon with all the attachments is on the floor. You can pick it up to test it again, or give it to a drone that will follow you around and the drone will level it up exactly how you made it during a run. A really clever idea that gives some extra meta progression to the game. If you decide you didn't like the weapon, you can sell it for some credits towards unlocking more weapons and attachments to use during a run. Or, you can put it on display to swap with the drone later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061212851730120076gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061212851730120076gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The map you drop into also needs actual exploration. You start off with a pretty blank map covered in a shroud / fog of war, which gets revealed as you run around. This exploration stays for your next run too, so you'll know more of where you want to go. As you explore you'll find various new areas with new types of enemies, along with the option to collect blueprints to unlock more weapons and attachments. <em>The map is also pretty darn big.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17355577861730120023gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17355577861730120023gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Trying to get a blueprint is quite difficult too as you need to stand in a specific area around a case, while a percentage ticks up towards 100% where you unlock the blueprint to buy it after a run. But, while you're waiting for the timer, enemies will swarm around you.</p>
<p>Quite a few different enemy types too and some entertaining boss battles as well, with each little boss getting their own fancy little mini-intro to highlight that they've appeared. Like all good survivor-likes, you unlock more of the game as you go. As you defeat these mini-bosses, more doors in the home base will be available to walk through giving you access to more features.</p>
<p>A game that continues to open up the more you play it. Through all the weapons, the attachments, new areas of the map, the drone adjustments and so much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8621063321730120224gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8621063321730120224gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice and accessible too with options to auto aim, auto fire your main weapon and seperately the underbarrel if needed (so you could auto fire main weapon, and have say a grenade launcher underbarrel set to manual) or you can play it like a proper twin-stick shooter. The option is yours ‚Äî the perfect balance.</p>
<p>With the Early Access release there's already a <em>lot</em> of weapon types and attachments to try out many combinations with plans to add in more guns, more attachments, more enemies, more minibosses and just a lot more of everything. The developer said the current plan is to continue development in EA for at least a year, and if successful they will continue with post-release updates too.</p>
<p>Once you do die (and you will, a lot) the game over screen gives you a nice amount of details too. Showing off what killed you, how long you lasted, distanced travelled, missions completed and lots more to show off to friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21446843501730120024gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21446843501730120024gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It works thoroughly great with Proton on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. The developer noted they put great effort into ensuring it works well on Steam Deck. While performance in some places could be improved, overall it's great. The only issues on Steam Deck are the black bars at the bottom and top of the screen, hopefully they add the proper aspect ratio to use the whole Deck screen. And some text on items is a little small, so they need some scaling there.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, duty calls, I'm off for another run in NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor because it's just that good. It has instantly become my new go-to game for when I need to blast around in something for a while. This will keep your attention for a whole lot of hours if you wish to not only complete the missions to unlock more, but to keep trying out the hundreds of combinations of weapons you can build. Awesome. Go grab it.</p>

      <title>Portal fans may want to try the demo for Total Reload</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you loved the overall style of Portal and enjoy puzzle games, Total Reload looks like one to keep in your watch list. The developers recently updated the game to include a Native Linux demo too.</p>
<p>A strange sounding one, with a description from the developer that leaves more questions than answers. There's something wrong with the Universe itself apparently it's just one big disaster, so you're going to try and reboot it all. Well, that's certainly an idea.</p>
<p>As they said: "The game world of TOTAL RELOAD consists of many locations connected by special devices for fast movement called Quantum Transporters. Each location has different energy sources that you have to combine into a single network with Quantum Transporters. Some energy sources are located in hard-to-reach places, and to get there, you'll have to use wires to temporarily supply power to various objects: moving platforms, sensor grids, energy filters and closed doors. In TOTAL RELOAD you have to learn to ‚Äúthink with wires‚Äù or, in other words, understand that by temporarily supplying power to various objects you can get to previously inaccessible locations."</p>
<p>See their gameplay trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZTZ47NorD6U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a18db1a954262ce27f780cbebd57f34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZTZ47NorD6U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's due for a full release on January 15, 2025. Sounds like the demo is worth a go!</p>

      <title>Co-op dungeon crawler Barony gets a big free expansion with the Keep Your Secrets update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First-personal co-op dungeon crawler Barony has a big free "Keep Your Secrets" update out now expanding many areas of the game. The developer said that "Every feature of the expansion makes Barony richer and more interesting to explore."</p>
<p>With this free upgrade you get access to The Compendium, a journal of everything you find and see, giving you an easy way to look up anything you need to like the strengths and weaknesses of enemies. A feature the has been long-awaited since the original Kickstarter. They also overhauled the Ruins with around 170 new types of rooms and there's some new enemies to find. Like the Gnome Thieves that have given up mining and will instead attempt to rob you, Bugbears that use a variety of weapons to take you down, several new varieties of Slimes, Bats have been added that like to nest in small colonies and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wm-YbjU39HM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/51a505378da6109ba5b1407ff6214bf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wm-YbjU39HM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With an emphasis on intricate game systems and player freedom, classic roguelikes and RPGs provide challenge where your creativity, and perhaps your stats, are your only limits. We present these adventures in first-person, immersing you in the adventure. Quest alone, or with a full party, with each class offering skills and abilities to the team's toolbox. It's everything we love about table-top roleplaying, roguelikes, and immersive first-person action, in one complete package. With dungeons that are different every time you die, it's the lessons you take away from each delve that'll stick with you, while high-stakes thrills and surprises keep you coming back for more.</p>

      <title>Complex 2D train management sim Iron Roads hits Early Access in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a Demo and Steam Playtest available, Iron Roads from Cowleyfornia Studios is a top-down 2D train management game that's going to enter Early Access next year. Cowleyfornia Studios mentioned the EA date is now set for January 20th.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ijQ1tREKF0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed343d003c868eab69afa5f6b7c46301.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ijQ1tREKF0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iron Roads is a top-down 2D train management game for Desktop and Mobile with a focus on optimising train networks. Its minimalistic interface is easy to learn, but encourages deep and sophisticated gameplay. We‚Äôre aiming for the accessibility of Mini Metro and the depth of simulations such as OpenTTD, while also capturing the irreverent tone of games like Theme Hospital.</p>
<p>In addition to more established train management mechanics, Iron Roads explores themes surrounding sustainable development. Rather than encouraging unconstrained construction, the game reacts to the player‚Äôs actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the features already in include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up fast transport networks that will get erudite animal passengers to their destination on time</li>
<li>Efficient transport of goods in complex production chains.</li>
<li>A minimalistic interface that is easy to learn, but that allows for many happy hours optimising and building networks.</li>
<li>Music in Iron Roads is a combination of notes generated from trains and passengers, and authored melodies. The music generated is as unique as the layouts built by players.</li>
<li>Contracts: Scenarios come with a grant system where players can follow focussed goals to earn extra money and get the satisfaction of ticking off a to-do list.</li>
<li>Performance graphs: the main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise the train networks, so charts are available to analyse data relating to finances and passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a plan to add mod support, multiplayer, weather events and more.</p>
<p>The developers mentioned to me that not only does it have Native Linux support, but it's also mostly developed on Linux. Eventually they will also be adding in full controller support so it will be a better experience on Steam Deck then too.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age sold over 400,000 copies and sets a new player count record</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wube Software have announced some pretty incredible numbers after the release of the Factorio: Space Age DLC.</p>
<p>Released on October 21st, the Space Age expansion for Factorio is a truly huge addition to the game, and it's clear a lot of players are happy with it. In their latest Friday Facts <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wube Software mentioned how they've managed to sell over 400,000 copies.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing numbers for a game that's a good few years old now. Not just that, but the player numbers have absolutely rocketed upwards with it hitting a peak of 118,674 about 15 hours ago. For comparison the previous peak was "only" 34,700 all the way back in 2020.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution survival sim Thrive v0.7.1 is a feature-filled release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an open source evolution sim that has continued to impress me, and the latest release version 0.7.1 is nice and feature-filled.</p>
<p>Some nice improvements to the visuals in this release too, it's not just about new features. The world backgrounds are now much more dynamic with new effects like bubbles and distortions with various layers. The developers added a bloom effect, membranes are now fully 3D to make cells look more realistic, new ice chunks and more work to bring up the visual assets in the later stages of the game.</p>
<p>A major new game mechanic with oxygenation has been implemented too. With this you now initially spawn on a world without oxygen, but the world will evolve with you and oxygen will slowly be produced by various lifeforms and so you'll need to deal with the new systems revolving around that. As a whole the game is just a lot more dynamic now. </p>

<p>There's more to the update including a rework of the auto-evo reports, giving you a better understanding of what exactly is going on in the world. Plus there's now a Food Chain tab, so you can see the distribution of organisms across different levels of the chain.</p>
<p>Thrive has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.

      <title>Check out the classic CRPG inspired Passageway of the Ancients out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Linux support from Passageway Games, a new retro-styled RPG is here for you to sink some hours into with Passageway of the Ancients.</p>
<p>With gameplay and a visual style clearly inspired by many of the great early CRPGs like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, this might be quite the treat for fans of the genre. This is a game that very much feels like a blast from the past right down to spending an age customizing your character.</p>
<p>The character creator is a bit of an odd one. It has lots of customization for body parts size like upper arm mass, triceps tone, breast size, belly girth, the size and shape of your hips and so on. Lots of individual bits, but then it skimps on things like hair colour with only a couple of options. Either way, you're going to be there a while. Look at the options for just your nose:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16522720701729964350gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16522720701729964350gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>I won't say how long I was there, but it was a while‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Passageway of the Ancients takes you to the world of Aieryon ‚Äì the galaxy‚Äôs sole remaining magical planet ‚Äì where you explore the city of Ithgar to solve an unspeakable crime. Beset with grief, you‚Äôre tasked with surviving deadly creatures lurking behind every door while gathering clues, managing your party, and leveling up your characters. You also must pick locks and solve Runic puzzles to gather the best loot."</p>
<p>Certainly a peculiar mix this one. Giving you somewhat tactical real-time combat with pausing, along with a strange dual personas system. At the start you pick your <em>public-facing</em> race, but you also have a special "Dragonkindt" form that you develop simultaneously. There's also a few different necessary options to tweak for the combat. Like melee for example lets you pick your attack form, attack height, stroke type and so on. Then magic allows you to tweak a few different things too like your vocal energy put into it, complexity of the spell mechanic and more that all together change how fast you cast and how much damage you'll do ‚Äî it can be a little confusing to get into. <em>So many options.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3UIFoiGnd9o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/183f3737ba1a5ff801d548843546449d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3UIFoiGnd9o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want an RPG that's clearly designed with love for the classics, but also tries to do its own thing this is definitely one for you. Passageway of the Ancients will have you ending up getting totally absorbed by it for a whole lot of hours as you explore the world, especially while hunting for some good loot. I'm certainly looking forward to more from Passageway Games!</p>
<p>‚ÄúReleasing a game like Passageway of the Ancients in 2024 feels like going back in time ‚Äì back to the days of 40+ hour campaigns with no microtransactions ... just a straightforward, polished experience you can enjoy free of interruptions. We sincerely hope gamers give our little CRPG a chance. It‚Äôs packed full of everything we love about the classics: a feeling of adventure, plenty of danger, interesting characters, and challenging scenarios. It‚Äôs the game I‚Äôve been dreaming about making for decades.‚Äù ‚Äì Jon Grierson (Creative &amp; Technical Director, Passageway Games)</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engage in Turn-Based &amp; Real-Time Combat: Use both turn-based and real-time elements ‚Äì drawing on real medieval weapons and tactics.</li>
<li>Unleash Your Dragonkindt Nature: Develop your character‚Äôs two personas simultaneously ‚Äì a hidden ‚ÄúDragonkindt,‚Äù and a public-facing race of your choosing.</li>
<li>Sharpen Your Wits &amp; Make Strategic Choices: Manage battle spoils, solve puzzles, adjust the frequency of special activities, choose interactions, and gather clues.</li>
<li>Wield Powerful Magical Items: Carefully equip items affecting intelligence, will, and other character attributes.</li>
<li>Customize Your Character: Choose your character‚Äôs alternate persona, appearance, and gender as Dwarf, Elf or Human.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support which as far as I could tell works really nicely.</p>
