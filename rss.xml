      <title>Riot Games talk Vanguard anti-cheat for League of Legends and why it&#39;s a no for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While previously you've been able to play League of Legends on Linux, and there's some pretty die-hard fans using Wine to play it, that's set to end soon with Vanguard being introduced.</p>
<p>Cheating in online games is a constant battle for game developers, so I certainly appreciate it's a difficult subject to approach. Developers want players to have the easiest time getting into the game, that's obvious, but with so many cheats out there it's a difficult balancing act. They stated that "as many as 1 in 15 games globally has had a scripter or botter in it, but in some regions, this number is as high as 1 in 5" which is pretty problematic.</p>
<p>For those curious on their thoughts about Linux, and people playing LoL on Linux going forward they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: What about Linux?</strong></p>
<p>We've never officially supported Linux, and it's true that the current Lutris-based implementation for League (that uses wine) will not be able to satisfy the Vanguard driver requirements. Linux does not currently afford us sufficient ability to attest boot state or kernel modules, and the difficulty in securing it is only compounded by all the frustrating differences between distributions. Even allowing emulation is an exceptionally dangerous game, as many cheats could then just run on the host, manipulating or analyzing the VM in a way that would be invisible to Vanguard within it.</p>
<p>Half of anti-cheat is making sure the environment hasn't been tampered with, and this is extremely hard on Linux by design. Any backdoors we leave open for it are ones developers will immediately leverage for cheats, and yesterday, there were just over 800 Linux users on League. We have evaluated this risk to not be worth the payoff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And about having it be open source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Why not open source the driver?</strong></p>
<p>Anti-cheat is an iterative, indefinite battle. Many of the preventative checks that Vanguard makes to ensure system integrity are deliberately stealthy, bleeding-edge, and in some cases, built on total pillars of sand. We benefit extensively from the confusion that the system inflicts on cheaters, and letting them simply browse the detection methods would exhaust our supply faster than we could invent new ones. An <a href="https://github.com/RiotVanguard/Vanguard" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source anti-cheat application</a> would be totally useless (April Fools 2021).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it, you simply won't be able to play it on Linux with the introduction of Vanguard. We already knew this but at least they're trying to give more detailed explanations.</p>
<p>See their full blog post on the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-vanguard-x-lol/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LoL website</a> which goes into plenty more detail on their struggle against cheaters.</p>

      <title>Fallout 4 is getting a fresh update and will be Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bethesda announced that Fallout 4 is getting a fresh update to bring some new features, along with getting it Steam Deck Verified later in April.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s2bXQEbpcrsdCZhUYLHAi/fallout-4-is-getting-free-updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> it mentions April 25th along with next-gen console updates us PC players will also see "widescreen and ultra-wide support, fixes to Creation Kit and a variety of quest updates". On top of that we're also getting "stability, mods and bug fixes" and "Fallout 4 will also be Steam Deck verified" (it's currently only rated Playable by Valve).</p>
<p>For a game that's over 8 years old this is really nice to see!</p>
<p>Free Creation Club items are also on the way in a new "Echoes of the Past" quest that sees you try to stop "The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth". They said that along with workshop items and the Enclave Colonel uniform they're also including some other previously released content:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enclave Weapon Skins</li>
<li>Enclave Armor Skins</li>
<li>Tesla Cannon</li>
<li>Hellfire Power Armor</li>
<li>X-02 Power Armor</li>
<li>Heavy Incinerator</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/skyrim-special-edition-updated-with-steam-deck-support-ultrawide-res-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Skyrim actually got a similar update </a>late last year, so I wouldn't be surprised if they lock down some options like they did for Skyrim on Steam Deck. Depends what exactly they mean by getting it Verified for Fallout 4.</p>

      <title>Combined Arms (OpenRA) for Command &amp; Conquer just had a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some more RTS in your life? Combined Arms is one of my favourites. Built on the free and open source OpenRA, it brings together the Allies, Soviets, GDI, Nod and Scrin. The modders working on it have done some really impressive stuff with it and the latest version sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Version 1.02 released April 5th and brought with it some big new features like smart casting for unit abilities, 72 new maps, a whole bunch of new voice lines, new visual effects and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997228061712845387gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997228061712845387gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can play it completely free since it depends on OpenRA which is open source, plus the original C&amp;C games were set free a long time ago by EA. Although they are once again selling them on Steam in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection-launched-on-steam-and-other-classics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Command &amp; Conquer The Ultimate Collection</a> for convenience. But Combined Arms will pull what it needs from the previous freeware releases for you. No set-up needed.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest stuff in v1.02 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smart casting for unit abilities (by default only the closest unit to the target will fire &amp; ctrl can be used to force all selected units to fire).</li>

<li>Added button in skirmish/multiplayer lobby to reset options to defaults.</li>

<li>Overhauled Mini Drone attachment (making them easier to attach and less glitchy).</li>
<li>Improved support power targeting visuals.</li>
<li>Vehicles/aircraft can be sold at Service Depots.</li>
<li>Multi-Queue Scaled - Removed Optimized Production upgrades. Associated discounts are permanently provided by the relevant T2/T3 structures being built.</li>
<li>Lowered selection priority for transport aircraft.</li>
<li>20 new 1v1 maps.</li>
<li>52 new team game maps (17x 2v2, 15x 3v3, 10x 4v4, 8x 5v5, 2x 6v6)</li>
<li>Added Testing Grounds map.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Artwork &amp; SFX</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New voice lines for many units: Chrono Prison, Battle Fortress, Mirage Tank, Cryo Launcher, Siege Tank, Sukhoi, Halo, Thief, Eradicator, Disruptor, Mammoth Tank, Titan, Juggernaut, Battle Drone, Mammoth Drone, X-O Powersuit, Comanche, Microwave Tank, Spectre, Venom, Acolyte, Templar and Heavy Flame Tank.</li>
<li>New voice announcements for upgrades: Seismic Missiles, Railgun Titan, Ion Mammoth, Hover Mammoth, Battle Drone, Intensified Microwaves.</li>
<li>Improved custom RA EVA voice line effects.</li>
<li>Added/updated transport loading and aircraft takeoff/landing sound effects.</li>
<li>Added IFV transform sound.</li>
<li>Added additional visual when units are upgrading.</li>
<li>Added brass casings ejected from vehicles/aircraft with machine guns.</li>
<li>New sound effects for Vulcan weapon.</li>
<li>Impact sound effects for Shard Launcher, Gun Walker, Shard Walker, Ravager, Lacerator.</li>

      <title>Cave-diving action roguelite UnderMine 2 announced by Thorium</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another interesting one from the Triple-I showcase is UnderMine 2, Thorium's follow-up to their pretty great cave-diving action roguelite and this one sounds like a good improvement over the first game.</p>
<p>They said it's been in development for three years now, building on top of the best parts of the first. Check out their teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4-7OAiV8QTE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06119b3ff08b675a2bb63e189bdbb404.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4-7OAiV8QTE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features announced for the sequel include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 Player Local Co-op (online via Steam Remote Play) - Play through the entirety of the game with a friend by your side. UnderMine 2 supports drop in and out co-op with dynamically scaling difficulty. See what new item combos and strategic options open up with two players.</li>
<li>Playable Character Classes - Discover, unlock, and play as different characters including some favorites from UnderMine. Each playable character has unique stats, abilities, upgrades, and relics they can find. Each character significantly alters the feel of the game.</li>
<li>Branching Paths - New regions of the Undermine have been revealed, and each branches off into various other areas. Navigate it to complete builds, quests, and different objectives. Your final challenge depends entirely on your decisions throughout the run.</li>
<li>Arcana - Wield new, interactive relics called Arcana. Each adds a new ability to your character, from casting fireballs to summoning skeleton minions to rearranging time and space. Arcana can make an old character feel new by centering entire builds around their function.</li>
<li>Full Mod and Workshop Support - We’re shipping you the tools we use to make the game and making it as easy as possible to upload and download mods from Steam Workshop. We feel we’ve created a really great technical platform and are excited to share that with you.</li>
<li>And a lot more! More characters, more zones, more items, and more action all around!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear yet if UnderMine 2 will have Native Linux support like the first entry, if not no doubt it will work with Proton.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869780/UnderMine_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Brotato: Abyssal Terrors is going to ruin my free time, especially with co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no, please no more, I have so little time as it is. Brotato: Abyssal Terrors has been announced as the first DLC for the excellent top-down arena shooter roguelite Brotato and it's full of goodies.</p>
<p>Not only is a content-filled DLC on the way but a free update is also coming with local co-op for up to 4 players, game balancing adjustments, bug fixes and even new content for everyone. Alone that's kind of huge, co-op for Brotato is something many have wanted to see. I can't wait to see just how crazy it is with multiple players!</p>
<p>The DLC though, damn, that's going to give you plenty more including: 20 new waves with new enemies, elites and bosses, 10+ new characters, 10+ new weapons and 30+ new items.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rn_9djqZZVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/361278957c4dd187c46cc54571725eef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rn_9djqZZVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It works to perfection on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. It's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and I suggest you do because it's fab. Brotato is easily one of my favourite games released in 2023 for sure.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 gets a new trailer plus a demo for Steam Next Fest in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the games I am truly most looking forward to getting my hands on is Streets of Rogue 2, which seems like it takes everything good about the first game and just expands on it greatly. Gimme.</p>
<p>At the Triple-I showcase a new trailer was shown off, and an announcement that a playable demo will be live for Steam Next Fest in June. The trailer below shows off plenty to be excited about including vehicles, lots of explosions and just pure chaos as we're all expecting from it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7AJBiX-N3Sg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b829aaf905f9f9c2c84493f503ba3659.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7AJBiX-N3Sg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Streets of Rogue 2 is the culmination of nearly 10 years of ongoing work on the series. I'm looking forward to giving a sneak peek with the demo, and getting more content into everyone's hands via Early Access later this year!” said Matt Dabrowski, creator of the Streets of Rogue franchise.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dozens of unique and quirky playable classes (i.e., Ninja, Werewolf, Investment Banker, Alien…)</li>
<li>Seamless, procedurally generated open world with a map 100 times the size of a single level from Streets of Rogue 1 and multiple unique biomes from bustling cities to creepy forests</li>
<li>An absurd amount of intertwined gameplay systems in the best tradition of immersive sims: destructible environments, hacking, smart NPC AI, mind control, farming, building, vehicles, etc</li>
<li>You can pet the dog. And also ride the dog!</li>
<li>Wreak havoc with a vast arsenal of items and weapons: shrink rays, bear traps, rat-summoning ocarina, Necronomicon, landmines, firearms, rocket launchers, and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow Streets of Rogue 2 on Steam</a>. It's due for release with Linux support sometime later in 2024. And I highly recommend the first game too which is great fun in co-op available from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/streets_of_rogue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512900/Streets_of_Rogue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns is a Contra collab DLC releasing May 9th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fun looking one from the Triple-I showcase is Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns, a fresh new DLC for everyone's favourite survivor game. This is a collab between developer poncle and KONAMI's Contra team.</p>
<p>You thought Vampire Survivors would do Castlevania? Wrong. But you are getting guns. Those pesky creatures won't know what hit them. With the DLC you will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 gun-slinging characters</li>
<li>22 new weapons between base versions and evolutions. They're not all guns - some of them trigger explosions too!</li>
<li>1 large stage and 1 bonus stage</li>
<li>13 music tracks directly from the Contra series and 6 brand new covers</li>
<li>An explosively silly 6-chapters Adventure</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JL-73l_hCMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cfbb2e05e723f9297f023a6ca8a2bd08.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JL-73l_hCMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Releasing on May 9th for $2.49 / €2.49 / £1.99. Can't really argue with that price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the DLC the developer poncle said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual the DLC will add a new stage in Stage Selection, from where you'll be able to start the chain of unlocks to get the new characters and weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Most characters will offer cross-stats benefits for players who like min-maxing, and will be able to find special pickups typical of the Contra series, like Grenades or RapidFires.<br/>
<br/>
Most weapons will have a damage output slightly lower than usual to try paying a little homage to the historically high difficulty of the Contra series, but also there will be a lot Arcana interactions to customise the difficulty to your liking. In the same spirit, there are several weapons that require some aiming or that follow the typical arcade 8-angle constraints when firing.<br/>
<br/>
While we like to joke about the concept of just adding a ton of guns, actually there will also be melee weapons and most of the new projectiles are rather unusual.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, yes, the silly racing-stage seen in the trailer is real and will be playable!</p>

      <title>Lutris v0.5.17 brings critical bug fixes and a new way to run games with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source game manager Lutris has a new release out, with brings in some critical bug fixes along with some new features needing testing.</p>
<p>One of the main additions this time is support for <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher" rel="noopener" target="_blank">umu</a>, the Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher, which allows you to properly run Proton outside of Steam. From the GitHub: "It is essentially a copy of the Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools that Valve uses for proton, with some modifications made so that it can be used outside of Steam" that other launchers like Lutris and Heroic can use.</p>
<p>The developer notes this new feature is experimental, but is also now the only way to use Proton in Lutris.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070408881712835084gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070408881712835084gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix critical bug preventing completion of installs if the script specifies a wine version</li>
<li>Fix critical bug preventing Steam library sync</li>
<li>Fix critical bug preventing game or runner uninstall in Flatpak</li>
<li>Support for library sync to lutris.net, this allows to sync games, play time and categories to multiple devices.</li>
<li>Remove "Lutris" service view; with library sync the "Games" view replaces it.</li>
<li>Torturous and sadistic options for multi-GPUs that were half broken and understood by no one have been replaced by a simple GPU selector.</li>
<li>EXPERIMENTAL support for umu, which allows running games with Proton and Vessel. Using Proton in Lutris without umu is no longer possible.</li>
<li>Better and sensible sorting for games (sorting by playtime or last played no longer needs to be reversed)</li>
<li>Support the "Categories" command when you select multiple games</li>
<li>Notification bar when your Lutris is no longer supported</li>
<li>Improved error dialog.</li>
<li>Add Vita3k runner (thanks <a href="https://github.com/ItsAllAboutTheCode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@ItsAllAboutTheCode</a>)</li>
<li>Add Supermodel runner</li>
<li>WUA files are now supported in Cemu</li>
<li>"Show Hidden Games" now displays the hidden games in a separate view, and re-hides them as soon as you leave it.</li>
<li>Support transparent PNG files for custom banner and cover-art</li>
<li>Images are now downloaded for manually added games.</li>
<li>Deprecate 'exe', 'main_file' or 'iso' placed at the root of the script, all lutris.net installers have been updated accordingly.</li>
<li>Deprecate libstrangle and xgamma support.</li>
<li>Deprecate DXVK state cache feature (it was never used and is no longer relevant to DXVK 2)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Slay the Spire 2 announced by Mega Crit for 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mega Crit have announced Slay the Spire 2 during the Triple-I showcase, a game that no doubt will be exciting for many with how great the first is. You've got a good while to wait though, as it's going to be hitting Early Access in 2025. Good things come to those who wait though, as they say.</p>
<p>"Civilization has waited 1,000 years for the Spire to reopen its doors...<br/>
Return to the Spire and face friends and foes in this sequel to the quintessential roguelike deckbuilder. How high will you ascend... and what truths lie at the top?"</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>

      <title>The first handheld to use PlaytronOS is some Web3 thing - the SuiPlay0x1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Playtron and PlaytronOS</a>? They made an attempt at a big splash recently with plans to create a Linux-powered system to rival SteamOS (Steam Deck) and Windows across various devices and multiple stores. The first device has been announced and it's some weird web3 thing.</p>
<p>I should note, Playtron's CEO offered some details before the announcement, but didn't actually follow-up on providing me with <em>anything</em>. So I'm simply going by what has been announced and the seemingly <a href="https://sui.io/suiplay0x1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official page</a> for it is mostly blank, with just a newsletter sign up box.</p>
<p>It was announced at Sui Basecamp (Sui being a Web3 blockchain company) with the reveal from Mysten Labs. According to Sui it's called the SuiPlay0x1 and it will be released in 2025. As <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1777990300138393895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> on X (formerly Twitter): "SuiPlay0X1 runs Playtron's device-agnostic gaming operating system, enabling gamers to play both Web3 and Web2 games across PC and mobile."</p>
<p>And uh, it looks apparently like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5521319781712764354gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5521319781712764354gol1.jpg"/></a>Picture credit: Sui/Mysten Labs/Playtron</em></p>
<p>Those sticks and d-pad look rather terrible don't think? Why is it so flat? That does not look comfortable to game with. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/suiplay-0x1-is-an-open-steam-deck-like-gaming-handheld-with-multiple-game-stores/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesBeat</a> have some more details, noting it will have "native Sui blockchain integration via zkLogin and Sui Kiosk SDKs, enabling asset ownership directly connected to a device’s account system for the first time in the gaming industry" and it might cost somewhere around $500 and while it seems to have deep integration with Sui blockchain stuff, it will support other stores too. Doesn't seem like any technical specifications have been given out yet.</p>
<p>So if blockchain web3 stuff is your jam, then you might be interested in this I guess? Not one for me honestly.</p>
<p>Until Playtron actually get some agreements to be on more…<em>normal</em> devices, I don't really see it going anywhere. At least once they eventually release the first public builds of the Linux-based PlaytronOS we might see what they're really up to.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Always nice to see more developers open up their games. ROTA released back in 2022 is now not only free, but it's also been made open source by the dev. It was made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> too, so could be an interesting one for people to learn more from a fully released game.</p>
<p>The developer didn't give any reasoning, their announcement on stores was short and to the point just mentioning it's free and open source now.</p>

      <title>The incredible pixel-smashing game Noita got a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noita is something really special, a roguelite game where every pixel is physically simulated and it's easily one of the best games ever made. It's grown again with another big free upgrade out with the Noita Epilogue 2 Update.</p>
<p>Here you get to fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself thanks to numerous crazy wands. Explore a variety of environments ranging from coal mines to freezing wastelands while delving deeper in search for unknown mysteries. The interactivity at play with all the individual pixels in Noita always amazes me.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11886899501712762046gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11886899501712762046gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Yes I was on fire on the above screenshot, and the fire was burning every damn pixel around the level exit. Woops. Had to wait a bit on that one. Or I could have found a little pool, or covered myself in blood pixels from enemies. You know, <em>something</em> to put my flames out. Look, you never know what's going to happen, it's such a dynamic game.</p>
<p>So what's the new update all about? Well it adds in a whole bunch of new spells to add to your wands including some secret spells, 6 new enemies to tear into pixels, new chemical reactions (oh boy), new potion reactions, 3 new boss fights, a utility box item, new rare materials, a new easter egg, a new secret quest, a new small biome, new additional audio added in, various fixes for when you move really fast, lots of bug fixes and lots of improvements for modders. Plus more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/881100/view/4212628592054084886" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux with Proton. Noita is absolutely not to be slept on.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider 1 open source engine TR1X adds a 60FPS mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Toaplan Arcade Shoot &#39;Em Up Collection Vol.4 is out now with more classics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a shoot 'em up fan you've been eating good recently, with another quality set of games out now in the Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Collection Vol.4. This is the last Toaplan collection coming from Bitwave Games, and so to go along with collection 4 they've also put up a bundle in the Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Ultimate Collection for all 16 games.</p>
<p>The games included in this collection are:</p>
<p><strong><em>Grind Stormer</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13755137541712738663gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"Grind Stormer, aka ‘V・V’, is a vertically scrolling shooter with gorgeous pixel art graphics and an upbeat FM soundtrack. Developed by an all-star team at Toaplan, the game is a superb early example of a manic shooter, a precursor to the ‘bullet hell’ shoot ‘em up genre so popular today. The Japanese version of the game, called V・V (pronounced V Five), features a selectable power-up system with gauges, providing a strategic gameplay element where the key to success is to use the appropriate weapon for each level and enemy encounter."</p>
<p><strong><em>Twin Hawk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13859091961712738542gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"Take on powerful tanks and battleships with in this military themed vertical arcade shoot ‘em up by Toaplan! Summon friendly fighter planes to avoid emergencies and increase firepower. A vertical scrolling shooter, gamers must defy the oncoming army and navy barrages, assisted by calling up a formation of six friendly fighters. In <strong><em>Twin Hawk</em></strong>, a strategic approach is the key to success, but the challenge ramps up when the last stage is cleared, entering Round Two of the conflict with the difficulty getting progressively harder with each loop of the game! Like the Japanese title of the game Daisenpu (Great Whirlwind) implies, the game will eventually come at you with full force, never letting go!"</p>
<p><strong><em>Truxton II</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9779976981712738500gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"The sequel to Toaplan’s shoot ‘em up masterpiece, <strong><em>Truxton II</em></strong> is a thrilling slice of space action with an unforgiving difficulty level. Enjoy the visually stunning pixel graphics and vibrant music as you dodge the high-speed bullet rain and take on tough bosses. Casual players who dare to play<strong><em> Truxton II </em></strong>can take solace in the added easy mode, and the modern features of rewind and quick save that gives players a fighting chance to advance through the quick bullet rain and tough bosses."</p>
<p><strong><em>Dogyuun</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17781719201712738582gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"A science fiction-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game known for its stunning detailed pixel art, gigantic bosses, and menacing difficulty. Quite possibly the most rock n’ roll shooting game of all time, <strong><em>Dogyuun</em></strong> is packed with a huge enemy variety, providing a tough challenge even for hardened shmup’ veterans. <strong><em>Dogyuun </em></strong>is a visual spectacle of amazing pixel art graphics and detailed animation under the artistic vision of Hayashi Miho and Koetsu Iwabuchi and marks the debut of manga artist Junya Inoue as one of the graphic artists."</p>
<p>And of course each comes with all the improvements Bitwave worked on like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Experience the game in Mirror Mode.</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra-customizable practice mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/39256/Toaplan_Arcade_Shootem_Ups_4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/toaplan_arcade_shootem_ups_4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> but looks like only Steam has the Linux versions.</p>

      <title>Please, Touch The Artwork 2 gets a bunch of Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Please, Touch The Artwork 2 is a free and highly rated hand-painted cozy hidden object adventure out now, and recently it had some nice Steam Deck improvements. For those of you who want a little casual gaming on the go, something to relax with for a bit, this seems like a nice pick. And hey it's free so no complaints there.</p>
<p>From the April 5th <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2600140/announcements/detail/4203621392781134069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix (gamepad + Steamdeck) in The City where you couldn’t move in the painting with the lady in front of the window.</li>
<li>SteamDeck: show onscreen keyboard for inputfields.</li>
<li>SteamDeck: automatically show/hide hand when playing with gamepad vs touchscreen.</li>
<li>SteamDeck: disabled windowmode and resolution selection because resolution is fixed.</li>
<li>Added numbers to levelnames to avoid confusion in level-order.</li>
<li>Made level names also clickable to start level.</li>
<li>Small fixes &amp; improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see even small fixes and improvements for the Steam Deck there, just to make it feel that little bit better. And a good excuse to give a fun free game a shout-out.</p>

      <title>Super Video Golf added a career mode - it deserves more attention</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Video Golf looks great for anyone who loves Golf, and it got a bit buried but the developer has continued to expand it with a recent update adding in a career mode. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>This 90s styled game offers up quite a lot including a free play mode, 8 player local and online support, a wide variety of course sizes including mini-golf along with various weather conditions. You can even play it at night if you wish. There's also a full tutorial and a driving range on top of that. There's also monthly challenges, leaderboards and even Steam Workshop support. What more could you want? I have no idea, I don't play Golf — but it looks genuinely good</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O76bLODRlwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/427d00c686f34659f3085bccd5073195.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O76bLODRlwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the new career mode added in you get to play through 6 seasons across 12 courses, over 36 games. If you rank in the top 3 you'll unlock various cosmetic items too which you can then use in the career or free play modes. There's a save system added in for it too, so you can drop out any time. The save system hasn't yet been added to the free play mode though.</p>

      <title>Linux continues to be above 4% on the desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to the StatCounter, Linux on the desktop has continued to rise and remains above 4%, with this being the healthiest it's ever looked on the desktop. </p>
<p>First hitting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/linux-on-the-desktop-breaks-4-for-the-first-time-on-statcounter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 4% in February</a>, their March data is now in showing not just staying above 4% but rising a little once again showing the trend is clear that Linux use is rising. Slow and steady wins the race as they say.</p>
<p>Here's how things have looked over the last year+</p>
<ul>
<li>January 23 - 2.91%</li>
<li>February 23 - 2.94%</li>
<li>March 23 - 2.85%</li>
<li>April 23 - 2.83%</li>
<li>May 23 - 2.7%</li>
<li>June 23 - 3.07%</li>
<li>July 23 - 3.12%</li>
<li>August 23 - 3.18%</li>
<li>September 23 - 3.02%</li>
<li>October 23 - 2.92%</li>
<li>November 23 - 3.22%</li>
<li>December 23 - 3.82%</li>
<li>January 24 - 3.77%</li>
<li>February 24 - 4.03%</li>
<li><strong>March 24 - 4.05%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, ChromeOS is also Linux, and while people like to debate that if you do include Linux and ChromeOS together it would actually be <strong>6.32%</strong>. A number that is getting steadily harder for developers of all kinds to ignore. It terms of overall percentage, it's still relatively small but when you think about how many people that actually is, it's a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>Another look since 2009:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21253730361712665899gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21253730361712665899gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>For those thinking it may be due to Steam Deck with SteamOS, it's unlikely, at least not directly. StatCounter gather their info from web traffic across over 1.5 million sites globally. I doubt all that many browse the web regularly on Deck. However, indirectly? Possible, I've seen lots and lots of posts about people enjoying Linux thanks to the Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck. There's going to be various other bigger factors at play here though, like Linux nowadays actually being properly <em>good</em> on the desktop.</p>

<p>Speaking about more retro games like this being revived and released on GOG their team said "With classics so well known and beloved, we're surely kicking off 2024 on a high note – making it undeniably clear that we’re not slowing down on a mission of games preservation. This is not GOG’s final word on the subject, that’s for sure – we have much more up our sleeves, and we’re looking forward to expanding our relationship with SNK, as well as their catalogue of timeless gems on our platform. So, better get ready, because more is yet to come".</p>
<p>They also have an <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2024_snk_publisher_sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SNK publisher sale</a> going on.</p>

      <title>Explicit GPU Synchronization for Xwayland now merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is finally here. Xwayland now has the code for Explicit GPU Synchronization merged after waiting over a year for everything to be ready. It's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/kdes-xaver-hugl-on-why-wayland-explicit-sync-is-such-a-big-deal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a pretty big deal</a> and should make NVIDIA GPU users especially happy in future.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/967" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merge request</a> that was originally opened by Erik Kurzinger from NVIDIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is our proposal for adding explicit GPU synchronization to the DRI3 and Present extensions, along with an implementation for Xwayland. While we at NVIDIA may be particularly keen to have this in place, since our driver lacks implicit sync support, a general consensus seems to be forming around the idea that explicit sync is the best path forward for the Linux graphics stack. Xwayland will likely remain an important component in that stack for some time yet, and therefore I feel that this work will be of long-term benefit to the community more broadly.</p>
<p>The design takes inspiration from the proposed Wayland wp_linux_explicit_sync_v2 protocol [1], making use of DRM syncobjs as the main primitive. I believe this offers a few benefits. One, having both X11 and Wayland use a similar mechanism for explicit sync will simplify development for client-side drivers, and two, it will also hopefully make it fairly straight-forward for Xwayland itself to add support for the Wayland explicit sync protocol, presumably once it's more widely implemented by compositors.</p>
<p>I've tried to keep this initial proposal focused on getting a usable GPU synchronization primitive in place, and adding support for it to the PresentPixmap request, believing this to be the most important part of the presentation pipeline. Other use-cases for this primitive are conceivable, for instance perhaps in the Damage extension, but I feel that those are best left for later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much is left to get everything all hooked up nicely, with an upcoming NVIDIA beta driver that should have support for it next month. The code for GNOME has <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3300" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already</a> been merged, KDE has a merge request <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/4693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open</a> for it too, Mesa also already has it <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25709?commit_id=5f7a5a27ef1b630bd1aea0cc0b1256fadee9de8e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merged</a> in.</p>
<p>Nice to see it finally there.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 41: The Worm Turns</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-40-the-cyborg-project/" target="_blank">Part 40: The Cyborg Project</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Somewhat similar to SDL, the Allegro library is a cross-platform backend for low-level game routines. Although the project does see continued support to this day with the Allegro 5 branch, for much of its history Allegro was very much associated with the MS-DOS freeware scene that was still going strong well into the early 2000s. Seeing this wealth of game content, the Fedora contributor Hans de Goede decided to see if he could port some of these over to Linux.</p>
<p>One group which were receptive to this were the developers of <em>Worminator 3</em>, an expanded version of the original <em>Worminator</em> inspired by the action platformer games released by both Apogee Software and id Software in the early 1990s. Included with the source code is the actual email correspondence Hans de Goede had with Electroencephalogram Productions going over the change in licence, as well as further fleshing out the whole process of bringing the game over to Linux.</p>
<p>I have often found using Allegro to be mercurial, and this again proved true. With both the allegro-4.2.1-1.rh7.rf.i386.rpm and allegro-devel-4.2.1-1.rh7.rf.i386.rpm packages installed I was able to get <em>Worminator 3</em> to build without any complaints, but the compiled binary for whatever reason was unable to find the Allegro library. To get the game to launch I ended up just grabbing the allegro-4.2.1.tar.gz source archive to make a separate library file, and then preloaded that to start the game.</p>
<p>As the title implies <em>Worminator</em> begins as a loose parody of <em>The Terminator</em> film from 1984, but with the roles reversed as you instead take on the role of the killer cyborg hunting down the rebel worms and their leader Wrom Conner. As the story branches out though things do get more complicated, with the second episode new to <em>Worminator 3</em> having a more surreal tone that even includes some rather risqué content. All in all this added personality is appreciated, especially in a free software title.</p>
<p>The creativity also bleeds into the artwork, which while being simplistic is also varied with a lot of nice small touches, such as the dedicated animations the game will play when left idle. With <em>Worminator</em> starting its life out on MS-DOS the game also has a lovely MIDI soundtrack which Allegro does play with my MIDI synth hardware, all of which kept me engaged enough to play through the whole campaign in the course of a single day and a very pleasant evening.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5623967661712601270gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5623967661712601270gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/254365991712601271gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/254365991712601271gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Performance wise the game averaged around 30 frames per second at 640x480 resolution for me, which is slower than I might have expected, but did little to impact the game experience. Lowering the resolution further did speed up the game, but since it did not scale I would have been left squinting at a tiny game window surrounded by black borders. Speaking of variable speed, <em>Worminator 3</em> also includes a bullet time mechanic I never found the need to use, but then the idea was in vogue at the time.</p>
<p>In the same vein are the vehicle sections found late in the second episode, but these are at least more cleverly implemented as they are utilized in solving a couple of neat puzzles. The tank did however introduce the only lock up I encountered in the game, which happened while driving into a large swarm of enemies in the very last level. Overall I found that the second episode was in fact easier than the first, but it was also the more enjoyable of the two.</p>
<p>The final level of the first episode features a mean trap where the game will take all of your weapons away, and as you will only pick up ammunition for the weapons you currently hold, you will be caught short unless you backtrack after acquiring new ones. This left me stuck on my first attempt, and since you only get the one save slot, I ended up having to start the whole game over from scratch; you can restart the current level after you die, but one of the doors refused to open for me after doing that.</p>
<p>Apart from this <em>Worminator 3</em> does present a fair challenge, but if you still do not wish to meet it, you can instead subvert it by playing with the various modes listed in the cheats menu. Also included are skins that allow you to play as someone other than the Worminator, for those thirsting for even more variety and customization. There is even a built-in level editor you can use to create your own missions, so the possibilities here really are endless.</p>
<p>Keen Linux users may also notice that the same sound effect Knoppix uses when shutting down can also be heard in one of the levels, although this is probably just due to them pulling from the same royalty free audio library. The last five games I have played had all been brought to Linux by virtue of having their source code made available, so I think it is about time I tackled another commercially released product, and return to my original intent of playing through the Loki Software ports.</p>

      <title>Old School Rally plans full support for Steam Deck - got me feeling nostalgic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have truly fond memories of spending entire days playing rally games on the original PlayStation, and some later games on PC and Old School Rally really looks the part.</p>
<p>The developer has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2824660/announcements/detail/4131562530385124011" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam that "Old School Rally will fully support the Steam Deck right out of the box when the game launches. (Verified status pending Valve review)". Good to see developers continue testing their games on Steam Deck <em>before</em> release instead of after - more of that needs to happen.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UoM0bz7zZH8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bbd253cd4414561d01e14f2a10f91ebb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UoM0bz7zZH8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I almost thought I was watching a video of Colin McRae Rally for a moment there. I love how indie developers refresh older classics like this that not only look the part, but come with all the niceties you expect from a modern PC release at the same time.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>RETRO STYLE VISUALS - </strong>Carefully crafted retro style visuals, reminiscent of the late '90s rally games evoking a sense of nostalgia and charm, making it a must-play for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>RACE THE WORLD - </strong>With a variety of rally tracks from around the globe, race across different surfaces inducing dirt, tarmac and snow and challenge your driving skills.</li>
<li><strong>RALLY CARS - </strong>Choose from a diverse lineup of rally cars inspired by the legends of the past, each with unique characteristics and features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It enters Early Access on Steam later this year and they think it will take 6-10 months to complete.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress hits 800,000 sales and no sign of it stopping</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress on Steam and itch.io has been a mega success for Bay 12 Games, a deserved success, given their previous free release supported and updated for a long time. Now the developers have confirmed it's closing in on a million sales.</p>
<p>In a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/with-800000-copies-of-dwarf-fortress-sold-the-newly-minted-millionaire-creators-most-ludicrous-largesse-has-been-a-honda-civic/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>, they confirmed it crossed over 800,000 sales and there's a million wishlists outstanding for it. Overall, remarkable stuff.</p>
<p>It beat their own wild expectations too, with Kitfox Games head <a href="https://medium.com/kitfox-games-shenanigans/dwarf-fortress-2-months-later-648d1c4f34d2" target="_blank">blogging</a> about back in February last year it was expected to only hit 160,000 in the first two months but by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/dwarf-fortress-hit-nearly-half-a-million-sales-in-december-2022/" target="_blank">January last year</a> it had already crossed over 500,000.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17541076611712573952gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17541076611712573952gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by reports from Bay 12 Games on their <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=8.0" target="_blank">forum</a> it sold around 27,000 copies in the recent Winter Sale and 13,500 in January as well so sales are still quite strong (there's been no update posted for February or March yet). No doubt the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/adventure-mode-for-dwarf-fortress-enters-beta-on-april-17/" target="_blank">upcoming Adventure Mode update</a> due later this month will give it a nice big boost too.</p>

<p>Discover Overlay, an open source Discord Overlay for Linux has a new release available with v0.7.3 adding in some useful new features.</p>
<p>What does it do? It enables you to have a HUD on your screen to show who is currently talking in a voice channel, or to show text and images from a selected channel with plenty of customizations. Made due to shortcomings in the official Discord Linux version.</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>If you mute mic, Discord will show you as muted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you mute output, Discord will show you as deafened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added controls to Configuration window:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Up/Down/Left/Right to move element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

      <title>KDE&#39;s Xaver Hugl on why Wayland explicit sync is such a big deal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may have seen news recently about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/explicit-sync-wayland-protocol-merged-wayland-protocols-1-34-released/" target="_blank">explicit sync for Wayland</a>, but you might not know why it's actually important for the future of Linux on Wayland.</p>
<p>I get it, Linux has a lot of these fancy sounding confusing things that are often a pretty big deal, but there's at times a real lack of a good explanation on <em>what</em> they do and <em>why</em> they're needed. So, KDE developer Xaver Hugl has written up a great <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2024/04/05/explicit-sync.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over a bit more about it. I do suggest you give it a read if you wish to learn more about it and what the previous problems where with other methods.</p>
<p>The biggest part of the problem has been, surprise — NVIDIA, since the proprietary NVIDIA driver doesn't support the older implicit sync at all. NVIDIA users have seen lots of issues due to all of this like significant flickering and frame pacing issues. Although seeing the issues does depend on various factors.</p>
<p>To sum it up, as Hugl said: "With the explicit sync protocol being implemented in compositors and very soon in Xwayland and the proprietary NVidia driver, all those problems will finally be a thing of the past, and the biggest remaining blocker for NVidia users to switch to Wayland will be gone."</p>
<p>Sounds great. So once everything is merged in and live, plus a new NVIDIA driver is released to take advantage of it, Wayland on Linux should be in really good shape for all users. A Beta NVIDIA driver is expected around May 15th that supports explicit sync.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.1 will be able to sync keyboard RGB to your chosen accent colour</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More work is ongoing for the upcoming KDE Plasma 6.1 release, and there's some fun stuff being added like the ability to sync your keyboard RGB lighting up to your Plasma accent colouring. This won't be forced of course, you can turn it on / off any time, and the option will only be available if it can detect it.</p>
<p>As noted by developer Nate Graham in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/04/05/this-week-in-kde-real-modifier-only-shortcuts-and-cropping-in-spectacle/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, see the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sd9Lqz9" target="_blank">video</a> taken from the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4093" target="_blank">merged code</a> by Natalie Clarius and there will be an easy toggle option for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13004707171712564579gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13004707171712564579gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some other useful changes coming include the option to crop image using the Spectacle screenshot tool making a return, this time integrated properly instead of using a 3rd-party library. That will be very useful.</p>
<p>Another big one is the ability to properly assign shortcuts to modifier keys. So you can rebind keys like Meta by itself allowing you to bind it to actions like opening the Overview, KRunner or anything else instead of having to edit some obscure file. They said this "work required extensive re-plumbing throughout KDE’s software stack". I sure do love the customization in Plasma!</p>
<p>Various other improvements on the way like proper error messages in the Dolphin file manager for actions you can't do, In Elisa (a music player) you can now switch between list and grid views as you see fit, You can now select multiple wallpapers in Plasma’s "add new wallpaper" dialog and various bug fixes.</p>

      <title>The ridiculously fun Windowkill gets modding support with a source code release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Windowkill is a fantastic twin-stick shooter, where the game window is constantly shrinking on you and enemies spawn across multiple windows. It's truly clever and now it has full customization available via the newly introduced modding support.</p>
<p>To enable this to work the developer has released the assets used under a CC BY 4.0 DEED license, the game source code was also released (although not open source, to help modding only) and they also released their custom Godot Engine changes now too.</p>

      <title>Check out the Manjaro Linux lead talk about the Orange Pi NEO gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Orange Pi NEO is an exciting looking gaming device, following in the footsteps of the Steam Deck being powered by Linux. Recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/orange-pi-neo-linux-gaming-handheld-starts-at-499-with-ryzen-7840u-ryzen-8840u-at-599/" target="_blank">the price was revealed</a>, and the Manjaro Linux head Philip Müller did a talk on it.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've seen Orange Pi themselves actually posting about it publicly (at least in the West). Most of the communication on this has been from the Manjaro Linux team directly so far, and the video mostly goes over what has already been announced about it. Still, it's nice to see an increasing presence for the upcoming release.</p>
<p>Check out the video below:</p>

      <title>Arch Linux changes vm.max_map_count to match Fedora, Ubuntu for better gaming </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more Linux distributions make changes to ensure the gaming experience is good. Arch Linux is now following Fedora and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/ubuntu-2404-increases-vm-max-map-count-for-smoother-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> on upping the vm.max_map_count value.</p>
<p>The issue is the default from the upstreaming Linux kernel is just too low for some games like The Finals, Hogwarts Legacy, DayZ, Counter-Strike 2 and various others causing them to crash. Not a good experience for end-users.</p>
<p>Announced in an official <a href="https://archlinux.org/news/increasing-the-default-vmmax_map_count-value/" target="_blank">news post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html#max-map-count" target="_blank">vm.max_map_count</a> paramater will be increased from the default <code class="inline-code">65530</code> value to <code class="inline-code">1048576</code>.</p>
<p>This change should help address performance, crash or start-up issues for a number of memory intensive applications, particularly for (but not limited to) <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2057792/comments/5" target="_blank">some Windows games</a> played through Wine/Steam Proton. Overall, end users should have a smoother experience out of the box with no expressed concerns about potential downsides in <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/5GU7ZUFI25T2IRXIQ62YYERQKIPE3U6E/" target="_blank">the related proposal on arch-dev-public mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>This <code class="inline-code">vm.max_map_count</code> increase is introduced in the <code class="inline-code">2024.04.07-1</code> release of the <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/filesystem/" target="_blank">filesystem package</a> and will be effective right after the upgrade.</p>
<p>Before upgrading, in case you are already setting your own value for that parameter in a <code class="inline-code">sysctl.d</code> configuration file, either remove it (to switch to the new default value) or make sure your configuration file will be read <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/sysctl.8#SYSTEM_FILE_PRECEDENCE" target="_blank">with a higher priority</a> than the <code class="inline-code">/usr/lib/sysctl.d/10-arch.conf</code> file (to supersede the new default value).</p>

<p>Want to know what your current value is? You can run this in terminal <code class="inline-code">cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count</code></p>
<p>If you want to test a different value, in terminal you can run <code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=1048576</code> which will persist until a reboot.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the most recent main release of the Heroic Games Launcher, there was an issue people found where games using Proton on Linux / Steam Deck wouldn't run. This latest hotfix should solve it.</p>
<p>What is Heroic? A cross-platform open source game launcher to manage games from GOG, Epic Games, Amazon and it can act as a Wine manager too for installing standalone apps and games.</p>
<p>The changes are small, since it's a quick hotfix, but an essential update if you also saw games not running. v2.14.1 Hotfix #1 <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.14.1" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Fix] Proton with ESYNC/FSYNC by <a href="https://github.com/CommandMC" target="_blank">@CommandMC</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/3676" target="_blank">#3676</a>.</li>
<li>[Chore] Use waitforexitandrun instead of run command for Proton by <a href="https://github.com/flavioislima" target="_blank">@flavioislima</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/3680" target="_blank">#3680</a>.</li>

      <title>Space sim X4: Foundations is getting another huge free update with added accessibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Egosoft continue expanding and improving their space sim X4: Foundations, with the next big free upgrade nearly ready. They've announced 7.00 is now available as a public Beta with a new features trailer.</p>
<p>Part of this update has a nice focus on usability and accessibility to make the game "game more accessible and enjoyable for all". This includes better button remapping, a FOV slider, new colour-blind options with customizable UI colours, audio and text feedback for various actions to assist you, a reduced speed mode for people who find it too hectic at times and Visual Enhancement Goggles that "let you zoom in on the action, along with a customisable radial menu for quick access to in-game actions, and reworked shaders in scan mode, further enriches player interaction and immersion"</p>
<p>By itself that would be quite a bit, but that's only the tip of the asteroid for this update. There's also temporal anti-aliasing, AI improvements, a reworked and expanded tutorial, explosion effect improvements, a late-game crisis for advanced players, additional sectors and landmarks, enhanced shadows, new ship types and reworks to some existing ships and just absolutely <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/4146197332005810099" target="_blank">loads of changes</a>.</p>

      <title>The latest indie hit on Steam sees you play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buckshot Roulette has made the jump from itch.io to Steam, and it seems like it's hitting the mark for a <em>lot</em> of players as it quickly gained an Overwhelmingly Positive rating. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>What is it? A tabletop horror game that attempts to re-design the infamous game of Russian Roulette, replacing the traditional revolver with a proper 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. In terms of style it looks a little like a more explosive Inscryption. It would be a little boring if it was an instant-kill type of thing though, which it isn't, instead it's based on a number of rounds and you have specific health points you need to take down too.</p>
<p>You take it in turns to shoot (obviously), after the dealer inserts a mixture of live and blank shells into the shotgun in a random order. The game gradually evolves too, with items that let you do things like handcuffs to have the dealer skip a go, a hand saw to deal double damage and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BbKAIy1GFF4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3793ce32a7dfc20981c82f08e3602379.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BbKAIy1GFF4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam release is quite a big expansion for the game too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New items for Double or Nothing mode: More useful tools for you, but also more useful tools for The Dealer. We hope to see you put them to good use.</li>
<li>Leaderboards: Let the whole wide world see how big of a gambler you really are.</li>
<li>Additional language support: The language of a shotgun blast is universal, but for everything else it is not.</li>
<li>Controller support: You won’t need aim assist anyway.</li>
<li>Steam Deck support (beta): Now you don’t even need to be next to your computer for that one more run.</li>
<li>Original Soundtrack is included in the Steam version, feel free to blast it in your rusty nightclub if you have one</li>
<li>Improved The Dealer’s AI in Double or Nothing mode. You gotta work hard for those millions, so don’t expect any mercy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a disturbing game of course but clever at the same time and with the tiny asking price (£2.49), it's easy to see why it's doing so well. Much like a lot of other recent smaller games, I can see this taking up quite a lot of my time. And — oh look, it's also another hit made with the free and open source cross-platform <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. It has Native Linux support too and in my gameplay time, it worked without issues.</p>
<p>It's set to keep expanding by the looks of it, with the developer mentioning a multiplayer mode is being worked on. Now that would be very interesting to see.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake is getting a huge patch with big optimizations - great for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios have announced their System Shock remake is set for a huge update arriving on April 11th, that will make it a whole lot better for everyone, especially Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Some of the major additions include a female Hacker added as a playable character, a rework of the final fight with "new mechanics and a unique flow", Cloud Sync support to pick up and continue on any machine, Alpha Strain enemies have a new attack, Avian Mutant enemies have a new attack, continued refinements to enemy AI and behaviours, some improvement animations, better gamepad handling, crash bug fixes and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/482400/view/4104540932632136261" target="_blank">whole lot</a> more.</p>
<p>A fun one for Steam Deck players is that they specifically noted "Major optimizations across the entire game — Steam Deck users rejoice!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2170387481712328604gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2170387481712328604gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Quite glad I've held off on a full play-through, as all the additions and tweaks sound fantastic. Currently System Shock is rated Steam Deck Playable and Gold on ProtonDB (but overall appears to work great with Proton).</p>

      <title>Open source Minecraft mod platform Modrinth goes indie, returns funds to investors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this isn't something you read every day, a platform actually taking steps to be sustainable and not chase constant growth backed by investors.</p>
<p>More about <a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a>: designed as the place to go for Minecraft modding, trying to pull people away from the likes of CurseForge and other platforms with it's fully open source model. They have their own official modding launcher, but their API can (and is) used by multiple other launchers. Basically, it makes modding Minecraft real easy and their open model is great.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.modrinth.com/p/capital-return" target="_blank">blog post</a> by the Modrinth Founder, Jai, they mentioned how about a "year and a half ago" <a href="https://blog.modrinth.com/p/accelerating-development" target="_blank">they raised</a> $1.2 million in a pre-seed round of investor capital. They used it to hire more people which allowed them to launch features like "creator monetization, authentication, analytics, organizations, collections, the Modrinth App, and support for more project types, growing Modrinth’s user base fifteen-fold".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13056697201712328018gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13056697201712328018gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Minecraft with Iris, Sodium and Complementary Shaders v4</em></p>
<p>Now though? They're going indie again and they've returned "$800k in remaining investor capital back to our investors". Why? The focus on "hyper-growth over maintenance" was causing issues for them, and "as we looked more into the future, we saw that the venture-backed cycle wouldn’t be the right path for Modrinth" due to investors naturally wanting a return and we all know how this goes. Growth at all costs, just look at the issues the game industry is facing as a whole with so many companies just firing staff to cut costs to ensure big profits continue.</p>
<p>As Jai said, "In short, forgoing the venture route would allow us to build Modrinth independently at a sustainable pace and put our creators, community, open-source nature, and values first, without having to worry about expectations of profit or growth".</p>

      <title>Mysterious thriller adventure The Heirloom launches in October - looks quite special</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an upcoming mysterious thriller adventure that looks quite special, one for fans of classic adventure games and it's releasing in October.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support, and I actually missed covering the original Kickstarter (there's just too many games to follow) where the developers raised $74,072 back in October 2023. Just recently they put up a new trailer I urge you to watch and get as excited as I am:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FwZR_jJNI2k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/817ae6e96afd8260df78ad85748ff945.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FwZR_jJNI2k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "After tragic events, orphaned 16-year-old Marla and her younger brother Jack find themselves in the care of their only living relative — a grumpy old man desperately trying to hide the secret of a dilapidated and frightening place in which he has been a recluse for many decades.</p>
<p>Forced to leave their home, Marla and Jack venture to faraway lands, across the ocean, to a small, nearly deserted town located in the western part of Scotland, somewhere on the Inner Hebrides.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the children begin to notice unexplainable and frightening things happening in and around their new home. Things the other inhabitants of the island struggle so hard to ignore."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mysterious story inspired by the atmosphere of the Hebrides and Scottish folklore.</li>
<li>Interesting, touching, sometimes eccentric and funny dialogues.</li>
<li>Each decision you make affects the plot and can lead to unpredictable results.</li>
<li>Stunning hand-drawn graphics and fascinating interactive cutscenes.</li>
<li>Unique and exciting combinations of game mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567320/The_Heirloom/" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>More security issues in X.Org and Xwayland revealed and new releases live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/xorg-and-xwayland-get-new-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">Back in January</a> we had some security issues revealed in both X.Org and Xwayland, and here we are with a few more and so there's new versions available for both to fix them.</p>
<p>The announcements came Wednesday, April 3rd with 4 issues noted in X.Org, 3 of which affected Xwayland too. You can see the details on each of the issues in the mailing list <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-April/061615.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>. The issues are as noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-31080: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcXIGetSelectedEvents - The ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function uses the byte-swapped length of the return data for the amount of data to return to the client, if the client has a different endianness than the X server.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-31081: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice - The ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function uses the byte-swapped length of the return data for the amount of data to return to the client, if the client has a different endianness than the X server.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-31082: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap - The ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function uses the byte-swapped length of the return data for the amount of data to return to the client, if the client has a different endianness than the X server.  This function is only found in the Xquartz server for MacOS systems, and not in Xwayland, Xorg, or any other X servers.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-31083: User-after-free in ProcRenderAddGlyphs - The ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function calls the AllocateGlyph() function to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server.  AllocateGlyph() would return a new glyph with refcount=0 and a re-used glyph would end up not changing the refcount at all. The resulting glyph_new array would thus have multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, resulting in a use-after-free when the same glyph pointer is then later used.</li>
</ul>
<p>xorg-server 21.1.12 <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-April/061616.html" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release addresses the following 4 security issues:</p>
<p> * CVE-2024-31080<br/>
 * CVE-2024-31081<br/>
 * CVE-2024-31082<br/>
 * CVE-2024-31083</p>
<p>Additionally it provides a way to disable byte-swapped clients either by command line flag or config option. This allows to turn off byte swapping code that has been a source of security problems lately. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>xwayland 23.2.5 <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-April/061614.html" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release contains the 3 security fixes that actually apply to<br/>
Xwayland reported in today's security advisory:</p>
<p>  * CVE-2024-31080<br/>
  * CVE-2024-31081<br/>
  * CVE-2024-31083</p>
<p>Additionally, it also contains a couple of other fixes, a copy/paste error in the DeviceStateNotify event and a fix to enable buttons with pointer gestures for backward compatibility with legacy X11 clients.</p>

      <title>Musical logic puzzler Beat &#39;N&#39; Path has a demo live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beat 'N' Path is a game that sees you combine together your creativity and logic to create machines to play music, it looks wonderful and there's now a demo available. It has Native Linux support from BitCutter Studios Inc., who previously made Groove Gunner and Balloonatics.</p>
<p>In it you generate, direct, shift, and combine signals and notes by wiring components and instruments together so solve and create a wide variety of musical machines. So like, a musical Zachtronics-like perhaps? Maybe a little there. Check out the previous trailer if you missed it:</p>

      <title>Battlefield V now broken on Steam Deck / Linux with EA anticheat live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's all folks. EA anticheat has now been added into Battlefield V, so it's the end of being able to play it on Steam Deck and other Linux systems.</p>
<p>This joins the likes of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2: Deluxe Edition, EA SPORTS FC 24, EA SPORTS FIFA 23, Battlefield 2042 and Madden NFL 24 that all have EA's own homegrown anti-cheat that make them simply unplayable on systems running Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19426081551712224696gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19426081551712224696gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now if you try to run it, you'll be greeted with an error. A shame to see a game that's multiple years old get broken like this and no doubt EA will continue to use their own EA anticheat in future online games. Battlefield 1 is still okay, and Apex Legends is also still running but perhaps it's only a matter of time before EA force it onto those too?</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point Valve can find a way to work with EA on this, to get it somehow working with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> like we've seen support for Easy Anti-Cheat, BattleEye, GameGuard and others.</p>
<p>What are some alternatives you can recommend for readers now looking to go elsewhere?</p>

      <title>MangoHud 0.7.2-rc1 adds Wayland keybinds, a time label and bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next version of the Linux performance overlay MangoHud is close, with a release candidate up now and ready for testing with MangoHud <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases/tag/v0.7.2-rc1" target="_blank">version 0.7.2-rc1</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A Vulkan and OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more on top of games and applications. You can use it on Desktop Linux, and it's what forms the Steam Deck's performance HUD too.</p>
<p>Here's all the <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases/tag/v0.7.2-rc1" target="_blank">improvements</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a label (you can remove this label with <code class="inline-code">no_time_label</code>)</li>
<li>Wayland keybinds have been added</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>frametime color wasn't being correctly inherited, the user was not able to change it's color</li>
<li>fixed a crash when pressing Shift_R + F9</li>
<li>config options now correctly override preset options</li>
<li>fixed RPM and % being incorrectly assigned for GPU fan speeds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">no_time_label</code> removes the label before <code class="inline-code">time</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">network</code> shows the throughput in kb/s for all interfaces or a specified list of interfaces e.g <code class="inline-code">network=eth0,wlo1</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a pre-release, there's no pre-compiled packages so you'll need to build it from source or wait for the full release after it's had some testing time.</p>
<p>An example of MangoHud with a horizontal style (look at the top):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1061428281712152345gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1061428281712152345gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you like that configuration for it here's my settings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>horizontal<br/>
legacy_layout=0<br/>
hud_no_margin<br/>
font_size=25<br/>
table_columns=25<br/>
background_alpha=0.5<br/>

toggle_hud=F8<br/>

text_outline_thickness=2<br/>
custom_text=GamingOnLinux<br/>
resolution</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 22 moves to Pipewire, will ship newer kernels after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news coming out of camp Linux Mint, as the upcoming release of Linux Mint 22 is set to be quite a good one for bringing it up to standard like other distributions on newer tech.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Mint's Clement Lefebvre mentioned various improvements coming like better localization support which will also use less disk space. Languages you don't pick will now <em>properly</em> be removed, and the ISO will actually have English, German, Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese, Dutch and Italian requiring no extra downloads for those.</p>
<p>Something big for audio fans is that Linux Mint 22 will also finally swap over to Pipewire as the default sound server, the Software Sources tool will feature support for the new Deb822 format and the next version of Pix (their image viewer) will support JXL images.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7028874071712148126gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7028874071712148126gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop</em></p>
<p>Another big change is their kernel versioning. Mint has always been quite reserved on using newer kernels, often sticking with older versions. They have been shipping EDGE ISOs with newer kernels for a while, but now they're going to follow Ubuntu with shipping new kernel series release after Linux Mint 22 is live. As Lefebvre mentioned "we didn’t observe significant differences in terms of stability between LTS and HWE series" and that a "growing number of users with new laptops/chipsets relied on EDGE images" so this move makes sense.</p>
<p>They've also made a new XApp, <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/gnome-online-accounts-gtk" target="_blank">GNOME Online Account GTK</a>, with a goal to work across any desktop environment to connect to online accounts like Google, Microsoft and so on. </p>
<p>Snap is also another issue, as the Mint team continue to not particularly like Canonical's packaging format. With Ubuntu moving Thunderbird into a Snap, the Mint team will now be packaging it themselves as a .deb.</p>
<p>They're also continuing to work on <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/jargonaut" target="_blank">Jargonaut</a>, a modern chat application that uses IRC under the hood.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator adds VR support in the latest free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator from Pine Studio has proven to be popular, so much in fact that they hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/escape-simulator-hits-1-million-sales-adds-voice-chat-and-new-map/" target="_blank">1 million sales</a> in less than a year and multiple expansions later there's another big free upgrade.</p>
<p>They've had crossover DLC with Among Us and Portal, which are both free, as well as a few paid extra DLC with more levels and content. Now they're back with a free VR upgrade. As they said in the announcement: "Escape from the base game as well as the additional free rooms in a fully interactive 3D environment, either by yourself or with friends. Throwing items to each other has never felt so real!".</p>
<p>You can even team up with players who don't have VR, which is a nice feature. To make all this work they said they actually "rebuilt the game from scratch for the VR version". However, the price will be increasing after April 14th, so picking it up now will get you it cheaper with all the updates.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fD5cxMeadws"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77fea50d22f9a88e4cf5b61c04f6bb85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fD5cxMeadws" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What can you actually play in VR? They said all 29 rooms in the base game and all of the DLC, according to their email "most of the 4.000 community-made rooms are now also available to enjoy in VR". This is great, because the level editor is one of the big pulls of the game and what helped make it so popular.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve puzzles. Face a growing collection of interactive escape rooms, spread across a variety of weird and wonderful locations such as the Labyrinth of Egypt, the Steampunk Airship, the Portal Escape Chamber or The Mini Skeld.</li>
<li>Team up with friends. Every Escape Simulator room supports online co-op! Join forces with friends to test your teamwork &amp; tackle puzzles together.</li>
<li>Powered by the community. Use the Room Editor to build your very own *dream* escape room. Or dive into one of the 4000+ custom rooms built by our creative community.</li>
<li>Dress to impress. Wear silly hats, customize your character &amp; wear a series of themed outfits, tailor-made for each puzzle environment.</li>
<li>Cause chaos! Smash vases. Melt locks. Rearrange the furniture. Make a mess! If it's not nailed down, you can pick it up (and inevitably throw it at your friends). Even more enjoyable in VR!</li>

      <title>Cozy Space Survivors is a sweet time survival roguelite in space</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cozy Space Survivors is an upcoming simple cozy time survival roguelite in space, a game for people who don't have all that much free time.</p>
<p>The developer said they were inspired by the likes of Vampire Survivors for the general simple gameplay, Binding of Isaac for physicality of bullets, Halls of Torment for adding Quests to a Vampire Survivors-Like, Fallout for the story summary at the end of the game and Into the Breach for the little NPC dialog texts which add so much atmosphere and so they've blended all the basic ideas into a simple but sweet package with Cozy Space Survivors.</p>
<p>About it: "Explore a colorful, tiny universe. Help its cute inhabitants solve their problems. Use satisfying weapons to defend you and your new friends against hordes of quirky enemies. You can focus on controlling your shipy while shooting happens automatically. There are unique landmarks to discover, and enemies leave experience points for level-ups to gain new skills. In addition, you can mine chocolate asteroids to unlock permanent upgrades."</p>
<p>See their WIP trailer below:</p>

<p>The developer, Simon Trümpler, has previously worked on the likes of X:Rebirth, Sacred 2, RIME, The Invisible Hours and more and now they're making their own game.</p>

      <title>Stop Killing Games is a new campaign to stop developers making games unplayable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've all been there right? You paid for a game, it required an active internet connection and a couple of years later the publisher decided they're done with it and shut it down leaving you with a broken game. Annoying.</p>
<p>Very annoying. It repeatedly happens, mostly AAA publishers that do it and their games are often quite expensive too. One of the most recent is The Crew from Ubisoft, a game that until late December last year cost £25.99. The developers at Ubisoft Ivory Tower <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew/news-updates/mOR3tviszkxfeQCUKxhOV/an-update-on-the-crew" target="_blank">announced</a> on December 14th that as of March 31st, 2024 the servers would be shut down and so it will no longer be playable for anyone. The Crew 2 is still online, and Ubisoft are about to launch The Crew Motorfest on Steam on April 18th.</p>
<p>So now YouTuber Ross Scott of Accursed Farms, has launched the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign to try and better highlight the issue. As noted on the campaign website: "An increasing number of videogames are sold as goods, but designed to be completely unplayable for everyone as soon as support ends. The legality of this practice is untested worldwide, and many governments do not have clear laws regarding these actions. It is our goal to have authorities examine this behavior and hopefully end it, as it is an assault on both consumer rights and preservation of media. We are pursuing this in two ways:"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w70Xc9CStoE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b16c9ef99a758e1b97aad8bfe1f3159.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w70Xc9CStoE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's definitely an interesting and often frustrating issue, especially for games that could seemingly continue to let you play offline without too much trouble. It's a complicated issue though, and the campaign might not end up going anywhere, but it's certainly going to be interesting to watch.</p>
<p>Unquestionably a campaign I can get behind though, because I've said for years it's a really poor situation for consumers to have your purchase suddenly stop working forever that you've not just put money into but often a ton of your time. It's a question of preservation too, the games are just — gone. <em>I miss the days where you could just host your own server.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts? </em></p>

      <title>Screenbound is a platformer where you play in 2D and 3D together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An upcoming game from Crescent Moon Games and Those Dang Games is Screenbound, and it really does look interesting for blending together 2D and 3D gameplay.</p>
<p>They say "Screenbound is a game about being distracted, but totally in control" and are claiming it's a "5D" game, since you have a Quantum boy device that transports you "into a weird dual dimensional space that occupies 5D = 3d + 2d". Now you've heard developers use 2D, 3D, 2.5D, 4D and so on but 5D? Okay then. Well, it does look genuinely interesting at least so I'll let 'em have it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uR2K8InGAus"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b0260dc6e8ad9695a96518515ac6889.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uR2K8InGAus" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the devs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Screenbound is a platformer unlike any other. You move in first person view at the same time while playing in 2d on the screen of your Qboy. Mind bending environmental puzzles will force you to test the limits of dimensional space. Your jumping and movements are mirrored - but certain things affect the opposite dimension. Combat is in 2d and you will receive your loot in 3d.</p>
<p>Find and explore many hidden areas and weird ideas will be all around you.</p>
<p>So how the heck did this happen? Your mom invented the device and you found it in the garage. She was keeping it secret all this time, and other dark secrets start to come out as you delve deeper. You'll find other stuff too. But let's not spoil the plot.</p>
<p>Screenbound also has a level editor in a traditional 2d style - but here's another twist. It auto-generates the 3d level for you! Just imagine the possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2805070/Screenbound/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Lemonade is an attempt to continue on the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank">Nintendo took down</a> the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu, the collateral damage was the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra which was also taken offline but Lemonade is an attempt to keep it going.</p>
<p>They don't directly mention Citra, probably through fear of it getting nuked from orbit and instead refer to it as the original "base" as mentioned on their website: "Lemonade was started after the base, a previous Nintendo 3ds emulator, was discontinued. The Lemonade Project was created to continue the work of base, fixing its issues and improving its performance and compatibility."</p>
<p>Most recently the Lemonade project put out a <a href="https://github.com/Lemonade-emu/Lemonade/releases/tag/Alpha-2" target="_blank">second</a> initial release which had initial support for Linux, macOS and Windows along with cleaning up a few issues. The Linux version is available as an easy AppImage.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be others that attempt to continue Citra, just like there's multiple that are currently trying to continue yuzu like suyu, although suyu already had an issue where <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/gitlab-takes-down-nintendo-switch-emulator-suyu-due-to-the-dmca/" target="_blank">GitLab took it down</a> so now they self-host their own Git for it.</p>
<p>Perhaps this one will stick around, maybe it won't, but for now it may be worth keeping an eye on it you're an emulation fan wanting to play some classic Nintendo 3DS games.</p>
<p>For those interested you can follow on <a href="https://github.com/Lemonade-emu/Lemonade" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://lemonade-emu.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

      <title>Of Life and Land is a promising settlement-building game with rich simulation out on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released into Early Access today is Of Life and Land (prev called Circle of Kerzoven), a settlement-building game from developer Marco Burri made in Godot. The release comes with Native Linux support. Note: key provided for me.</p>
<p>Having spent a little time with it, I can already see the charm here. It has a wonderful setting and style, and anyone who likes a city building challenge will probably enjoy it. The hook is really the heavy simulation going on, with every creature being independent. Even from the very beginning, you'll have all sorts of animals running around stealing your starting resources which is somewhat amusing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2246777241712069440gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2246777241712069440gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the impatient, it can be sped up quite a lot too with a 300x speed, a feature I quite appreciated when waiting for some necessary building resources to be gathered in the blink of an eye — nice. I wouldn't use that speed often though, unless you want your people to die off rapidly. </p>
<p>There's a lot of little individual things you need to learn about and keep an eye on here. Each villager has stats for food, water, rest, heat, overall health points and energy. So you need to ensure all their individual needs are met, while continuing to expand your village and keep everyone alive together. Quite something seeing everyone run around once you've built up a decently sized village to start unlocking more advanced buildings to expand further again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16968560891712071269gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16968560891712071269gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An interesting job system too. Each person can work multiple jobs, and they have a workload percentage, so you have to balance how many jobs they have and what jobs people do, to keep up with all your growing needs. Plus, on top of that, various buildings have multiple output types for you to pick your priorities on. There's just so much of <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>You also have events to deal with too with more people joining your village, or not, if you send them packing. Sometimes they have specific building requests too and I've no doubt the developer will expand the quest system through Early Access.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence of humans in nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>The seasons and climatic conditions affect the gameplay, as certain plants only grow in certain conditions and temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions where all items were crafted with same rules as for the player.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend through mod support.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fantastic start and with Early Access expected to last a few years, it has a lot of room left to grow still.</p>

      <title>Linux share on Steam bounces back to nearly 2% for March 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to all of Valve's effort with Proton, Steam Deck and their funding of people working on various other bits of Linux code like GPU drivers - the Linux share on Steam as of March 2024 bounced back to a near multi-year high.</p>
<p>After an odd <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-survey-for-february-2024-shows-a-big-bump-in-simplified-chinese/" target="_blank">dip in February</a>, where we saw a rise in Windows 10 and Simplified Chinese, Linux has jumped up a little again. Although the details are still a bit odd with Windows 10 seeing a bump again, but we saw <em>both</em> Simplified Chinese and English as overall languages each rise for March as well.</p>
<p>Overall the stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.67% -0.24%</li>
<li>Linux 1.94% +0.18%</li>
<li>macOS 1.38% +0.06%</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly thanks to the Steam Deck, Linux as a whole is now quite a bit more popular on Steam than macOS.</p>
<p>You can see the Linux stats over the past few years on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">GOL Steam Tracker</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1764339161712055101gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1764339161712055101gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center">The most popular Linux distributions on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 44.22% +0.67%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.66% -0.49%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.97% +0.45%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64 bit 5.54% +5.54%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.3 64 bit 3.77% +0.21%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.42% +0.07%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Other 29.41% -1.37%</li>

      <title>Flathub now prominently notes unverified Flatpak apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/oh-snap-canonical-now-doing-manual-reviews-for-new-packages-due-to-scam-apps/" target="_blank">After all the issues</a> with Canonical's Snap package scams lately, it seems the Flathub folks are continuing to ensure their platform is trustworthy.</p>
<p>For a while now developers have been able to get Verified on Flathub, and with it they get a nice blue tick to show off on app pages. This shows that the app is directly from the original developer. Now though, they're going a step further as noted on the official Flathub account on <a href="https://floss.social/@flathub/112175755723668238" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> as they're also now doing Unverified banners on pages that look like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11781715141712054096gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As they said: "If you see this, it flags that the app has not been verified by its developer—it’s effectively a community-maintained package." and they <a href="https://floss.social/@flathub/112175778679496400" target="_blank">continued</a>, "This provides a bit of clarity around the source of apps while helping increase trust for the growing number of verified apps. While we don’t require apps be verified or submitted by upstream developers, we highly encourage it."</p>
<p>They also reminded people that they always human-review every app submission on Flathub. Their team also put up a <a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/improved-build-validation/" target="_blank">blog post</a> back in February on some other moderation improvements to apps.</p>
<p>A feature request for Flatpak itself was also <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5757" target="_blank">opened</a> to show the Verified or Unverified status via the CLI, although there was already a more <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5320" target="_blank">generic request</a> open on that. So hopefully sometime soon it will show it all clear when you're not installing via an app.</p>

      <title>Get a whole lot of Fallout games in this Fanatical bundle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you somehow still don't own the Fallout games, and with the Amazon series coming up, maybe this <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/fallout-bundle?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fallout Bundle from Fanatical</a> might be a good time for you to dive in.</p>
<p>For £24.99 you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li>
<li>Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition</li>
<li>Fallout 76</li>
<li>Fallout Classic Collection:
<ul>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Fallout 2</li>
<li>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall a pretty good deal that. All of them should work on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton too.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/fallout-bundle?ref=gol" target="_blank">full bundle on Fanatical</a>. Apparently if you use the code "OMEN10" you may also get an additional discount.</p>

<p>Not surprising to see Balatro right up there in the list at number 2 with it being one of the biggest Steam releases in February. It's also much higher than it was in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-february-2024/" target="_blank">February most played list</a>.</p>

<p>I imagine next month Horizon Forbidden West will make an appearance in the list since it was released quite late in March. Interesting to also see Vampire Survivors back in the list, people just can't stay away from it.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.14 has GOG and Amazon fixes, category customization improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher version 2.14.0 has been released and with it some category customisation improvements, to make them easier to work with. Along with fixes for their GOG and Amazon integrations and plenty more.</p>
<p>For adjusting categories you can now add, edit or delete them directly from the drop-down menu making it a lot easier to move games around. There's various other UI improvements to make navigating the app easier, and a fix for issue with GOG as they're a GOG Affiliate and the previous version forced their affiliate links which caused issues with people who block AdTraction - so now it's optional.</p>

      <title>Free Settlers II inspired strategy game Widelands version 1.2 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's free, open source and full of features. Widelands, a game inspired by The Settlers II, has a big new release out now with version 1.2. The Settlers II, and the original, were some of the first strategy games I played so I love seeing projects like this continue their original idea on.</p>
<p>Widelands 1.1 was released back in October 2022, so the developers have had quite a while to expand it!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8842296671712050581gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8842296671712050581gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI Plugins</strong> are add-ons that can add more functionality to the user interface.</li>
<li><strong>Naval Warfare</strong> preview: Invade foreign coasts using warships!<br/>
<em>This is included as a preview feature and needs to be explicitly enabled in the game setup screen.</em></li>
<li><strong>Soldier garrisons</strong> for ports and headquarters.</li>
<li>Balancing changes to the Amazon economy.</li>
<li>Fifth scenario for the Frisian campaign.</li>
<li>More settings in the game setup screen, such as configurable durations for timed win conditions.</li>
<li>Diplomacy handling for the computer players.</li>
<li>Stick <strong>pinned notes</strong> onto map fields to mark important points.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> let you navigate within the encyclopedia and to the online help.</li>
<li>Easy <strong>maps publishing</strong> inside the editor.</li>
<li>High-resolution images for many more units.</li>
<li>Accessibility enhancements for many user interface components.</li>
<li>Expose more functionality to the add-ons and scenario scripting interface.</li>
<li>Fixed many crashes and hangs and enhanced error handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.widelands.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>. You can install it easily on Linux from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.widelands.Widelands" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>XZ tools and libraries compromised with a critical issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been an urgent security bulletin sent out in a few places today in the Linux sphere that relates to the XZ tools and libraries with liblzma, as certain version have been compromised.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4" target="_blank">OpenWall</a> security list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After observing a few odd symptoms around liblzma (part of the xz package) on Debian sid installations over the last weeks (logins with ssh taking a lot of CPU, valgrind errors) I figured out the answer:</p>
<p>The upstream xz repository and the xz tarballs have been backdoored.</p>
<p>At first I thought this was a compromise of debian's package, but it turns out to be upstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what they say the issue is present in version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the libraries.</p>
<p>This has led to Red Hat putting up an urgent <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-fedora-41-and-rawhide-users" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the matter, noting that so far Fedora Linux 40 is okay but you should "immediately stop usage of any Fedora Rawhide instances" as they were updated but they're going to be reverting to an older version.</p>
<p>For those not clear on what it is, as Red Hat noted: "xz is a general purpose data compression format present in nearly every Linux distribution, both community projects and commercial product distributions. Essentially, it helps compress (and then decompress) large file formats into smaller, more manageable sizes for sharing via file transfers".</p>
<p>Red Hat also noted the "malicious build interferes with authentication in sshd via systemd" and so "Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely".</p>
<p>Debian also has a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00057.html" target="_blank">security advisory</a> up on it noting that "no Debian stable versions are known to be affected" but the compromised packages were part of "Debian testing, unstable and experimental distributions" which they have reverted as well.</p>
<p>On the Ubuntu side they have a Discourse <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/xz-liblzma-security-update/43714/3" target="_blank">forum post</a> noting the affected package was removed from "Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) proposed builds" and they're continuing to investigate.</p>
<p>It has been assigned as <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3094" target="_blank">CVE-2024-3094</a> noting it is a critical issue.</p>
<p>So you'll want to ensure any XZ packages are not at version 5.6.0 or 5.6.1, and check the news directly from your chosen distribution for updates on it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 02/04/24</strong>: the Binarly Research Team <a href="https://www.binarly.io/blog/xz-utils-supply-chain-puzzle-binarly-ships-free-scanner-for-cve-2024-3094-backdoor" target="_blank">announced</a> a new <a href="https://xz.fail/" target="_blank">free tool</a> to scan an ELF binary for XZ backdoor detection.</p>

      <title>Maniac is classic GTA meets Vampire Survivors - out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Transhuman Design we have the next survivor-like game with Maniac, that puts it into a classic GTA setting while you go on a bit of a frenzy. If you love a good bit of chaos with plenty of upgrades and characters to unlock, this may very well be what you need.</p>
<p>If definitely reminds me of my earlier years playing the first and second Grand Theft Auto, complete with police car chases and helicopters flying around trying to catch you. Only here, you can keep levelling up to make everything all that bit more ridiculous.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Pzgopn35Gdk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7524d4e5a0e73a587bd29fe4089c82de.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pzgopn35Gdk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six insane characters with unique abilities. Cause chaos with Drunk Santa, Hot Dog Guy, and even clowns.</li>
<li>Heart-pounding chase-driven action built on explosive physics and destruction.</li>
<li>With each new crime, the law gets more ticked off - police, FBI, military, special forces and more will all be on your tail.</li>
<li>Buy guns, explosives, and special items to keep your runs going longer.</li>
<li>Unlockable items and upgrades across all characters - better guns, landmines, sturdier cars, and more cash-per-crime. The upgrade path is yours to choose!</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Linux version (personal purchase) it seemed to work really well, the only issue I noticed was the cursor in the menu being a bit too big which seems to be a common Unity game engine issue on Linux.</p>
<p>It's a lot of fun but gamepad support in it is weird since you only get auto aim, or aiming in the direction you're facing, which for this type of game feels like an odd choice. Having actual twin-stick aiming would make it feel a lot better on gamepad. The developer has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1482380/discussions/0/4358995119363962504/#c4358995119364969201" target="_blank">said</a> they do plan to add that in as soon as possible which is nice to see. Apart from that though, it's pretty much <em>exactly</em> as you would expect such a game to be. Over the top action, lots of explosions and complete anarchy as you smash through everyone and everything in your way.</p>
<p>If you love the idea then £4.29 is a great price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1482380/Maniac/" target="_blank">Available on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>The Triple-i Initiative gaming showcase is coming April 10th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>So we finally know what the mysterious Triple-i Initiative thing is! It's a big gaming showcase full of announcements and new footage for upcoming games centred around triple-i games and studios (big indies).</p>
<p>There's going to be a <strong>lot</strong> too, and I really do mean a <u>lot</u>. The event will be 45 minutes long starting April 10th at 10am PT / 7pm CEST / 5pm UTC and it will be pure gaming. So no adverts or extra fluff forced into it, just a feast for gamers wanting to see some great upcoming stuff.</p>
<p>What actually will be in it? Expect to see over 30 games with announcements and special reveals from the likes of the people behind Vampire Survivors, Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Hyper Light Drifter, Risk of Rain, Humble Games publisher, Assemble Entertainment and the list goes on.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RfLp07qc3M0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d384aa53523e6839ca8ab68ff656f1e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RfLp07qc3M0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We felt a need for a showcase that highlights wildly different indie games but that have one thing in common; they resonate with millions of players around the world. Since using letters seems to be the trend in the industry, we figured that adding a couple of i’s to indie was a fair way to describe this new format. Also, triple-i just sounds cool," said Bérenger Dupré, Evil Empire’s Marketing Director.</p>
<p>“The goal is to have a straight-to-the-point show packed with announcements as a collective of studios, to speak directly to players, the people who have been directly supporting us since day 1. The show will run for about 45 minutes, featuring news by the most successful and creative folks out there. No hosting segments, no advertisements, no sponsorships, no extra fluff, just games,” ​ added Benjamin Laulan, Evil Empire’s COO.</p>

      <title>Squad-based online shooter Enlisted: Reinforced now on Steam with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/03/24</strong>: the Steam released has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2051620/view/4186732260754268307" target="_blank">been pulled</a> temporarily due to all the negative reviews about issues with account linking and the bundled DLC. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Gaijin Network (War Thunder) and Darkflow Software (CRSED: Cuisine Royale) have today released the online squad-based shooter Enlisted: Reinforced into Early Access on Steam. As they said they would <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/squad-based-shooter-enlisted-reinforced-from-gaijin-is-coming-to-steam/" target="_blank">when I covered it previously</a>, the release comes with Native Linux support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="69OwvpQAgIo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25e94491de482a304a6d2b526052226d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/69OwvpQAgIo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game is free to play direct from their launcher the version on Steam costs £16.99 / $19.99 / 19,99€ which comes with two premium squads, 7 days of a premium account, 500 gold, a unique nickname decorator and 15 first aid kits for each squad. It <em>might</em> become free to play on Steam at some point after Early Access but it may not.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2051620/view/7281829929759186146" target="_blank">said</a> recently in a Steam post they will also be upgrading it for Steam Deck with "unique features specifically for Steam and Steam Deck".</p>
<p>From my brief test with a full game on my main Kubuntu Desktop, it worked really well with pretty good performance too thanks to it using Vulkan. Need a lot more time with it before giving any kind of recommendation as of yet though. Much like War Thunder, it seems to be very much pay-to-progress, or grind for quite a long time to get through all the research and different weapons.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted_Reinforced/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Take-Two Interactive buying Gearbox from Embracer, more Borderlands on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group continue to sell off more with the latest being Gearbox, which has been picked up by Take-Two Interactive in a $460 million deal.</p>
<p>As noted in the Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-gearbox-entertainment-for-a-consideration-of-usd-460-million-to-take-two-interactive-software-inc/" target="_blank">press release</a> that Gearbox Software (Frisco, Texas), Gearbox Montréal, Gearbox Studio Quebec along with the Borderlands and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands franchises, as well as Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem will be going to Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>Embracer will however keep hold of Gearbox Publishing San Francisco (to be renamed prior to closing, formerly named Perfect World Entertainment), including the publishing rights to the Remnant franchise, the upcoming Hyper Light Breaker and other notable unannounced game releases. They also keep Cryptic Studios, including MMO titles Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online, Lost Boys Interactive and Captured Dimensions.</p>
<p>Interestingly the deal is being done using "100% in newly issued Take-Two shares", which Embracer said they plan to "sell these shares to receive cash proceeds soon after closing".</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240327928202/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-to-Acquire-The-Gearbox-Entertainment-Company-Inc.-Developer-of-Highly-Successful-Borderlands-Franchise" target="_blank">press release</a> for Take-Two, it confirms "Gearbox currently has six key interactive entertainment projects in various stages of development, including five sequels, two of which are from the Borderlands and Homeworld franchises, and at least one exciting new intellectual property" - so Borderlands 4 is coming then it seems.</p>

      <title>Oh Snap! Canonical now doing manual reviews for new packages due to scam apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After repeatedly suffering issues with scam apps making it onto the Snap Store, Canonical maker of Ubuntu Linux have now decided to manually look over submissions.</p>
<p>I've covered the issues with the Snap Store a few times now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/knock-knock-whos-there-more-scam-apps-on-canonicals-snap-store/" target="_blank">like on March 19th</a> when ten scam crypto apps appeared, got taken down and then reappeared under a different publisher. Also earlier <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/snap-store-from-canonical-ubuntu-hit-with-another-crypto-scam-app/" target="_blank">back in February</a> there was an issue where a user actually lost their wallet as a result of a fake app. Multiple fake apps were also put up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/snap-store-from-canonical-hit-with-malicious-apps/" target="_blank">back in October last year</a> as well, so it was a repeating issue that really needed dealing with properly.</p>
<p>So to try and do something about it, Canonical's Holly Hall has <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/manual-review-of-all-new-snap-name-registrations/39440" target="_blank">posted</a> on their Discourse forum about how "The Store team and other engineering teams within Canonical have been continuously monitoring new snaps that are being registered, to detect potentially malicious actors" and that they will now do manual reviews whenever people try to register "a new snap name".</p>
<p>On top of that soon they will also be releasing a new policy regarding "crypto-wallet and other sensitive snaps" with "guidelines for how to publish such a snap". Currently all of this is not supposed to be long-term, as it's an evolving situation.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will begin to put an end to scam apps making it into the Snap Store and onto machines running Ubuntu and any other Linux distribution that enables Snap packages.</p>

      <title>PUNKCAKE Délicieux just added Linux support to a whole bunch of games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PUNKCAKE Délicieux are a game dev duo that release small fun games around once a month, and they've just now given all of their available titles the Linux (and macOS) treatment. They've made some pretty fun games looking at the list so you may want to go and check out a few of these.</p>
<p>One game you might have heard of is Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate, a rather unique strategy roguelike based on Chess, but you replace your army with a shotgun. A game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/bad-at-chess-bring-a-shotgun-in-this-roguelike-spin/" target="_blank">I covered back in 2022</a> when run through Proton and it was a blast. </p>

<p>They've made many more recent games too, but you should definitely give that one a go as it has my personal recommendation. </p>
<p>Other games they've made include their newest release this month with Stray Shot, which is a small arena shooter with a good few twists that looks like some great chaos: "This is a unique twin-stick arena shooter where your own actions define the difficulty. Shoot recklessly at the walls and you will drown in enemies, but shoot too little and you will have a mediocre score. Observe the different monsters's behaviours and be strategic in the way you fight them. The more monsters there are in the arena, the more points you get for each one defeated."</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/punkcake/" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>Most of the games are discounted right now across both stores, and there's a <a href="https://itch.io/s/121280/macos-and-linux-support-sale-" target="_blank">bundle of them on itch.io</a> to celebrate.</p>

      <title>SDL 3 will prefer Wayland Over X11, if certain protocols are available</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Less than a week ago, <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a> (Simple DirectMedia Layer) developers restarted the discussion regarding whether Wayland should be configured as the preferred over X11, and a PR was made to <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345" target="_blank">revert</a> a commit that set Wayland as preferred due to issues with needing fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 protocols. This was briefly touched on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/sdl-3-has-a-first-preview-release-out-with-hdr-and-vulkan-for-the-2d-rendering-api/" target="_blank">in our recent SDL 3 article</a>.</p>
<p>Quoting the issue description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This reverts commit<a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/f9f7db4e086036bd8ef3bce0f303e9057ee63040" target="_blank"> f9f7db4</a></p>
<p>Wayland has a myriad of unresolved problems regarding surface suspension blocking presentation and the FIFO (vsync) implementation being fundamentally broken leading to reduced GPU-bound performance.</p>
<p>That is not to say "we should fix FIFO in Mesa/other drivers," but rather that it is completely unfixable without an additional protocol, in this case fifo-v1<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/256" target="_blank">1</a>.</p>
<p>Without this protocol, vkQueuePresent or glSwapBuffers must stall for the 'frame' callback after presenting an image. The only reason we can get away with this on SteamOS is because Gamescope implements what is essentially fifo-v1 and we use that there.</p>
<p>The other side is surface suspension -- a very similar issue to the above wrt the frame callback being used in that way and blocking. If the SDL window is obscured, vkQueuePresent will block in FIFO, which games typically do NOT like. This is solved by the combination of fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1.</p>
<p>There is no advantage to games and average applications preferring Wayland over X11 -- only severe performance and unusability regressions right now.<br/>
Thus, we must revert this change until fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 are released and at least in a stable release for major compositors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While SDL <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/254fcc90eb22bb159ab365ad956222a9c5632841" target="_blank">tried</a> for the last two years to push Wayland by default and had to revert because there were a number of issues with third-party software (NVIDIA drivers, libwayland event overflow, libdecor not handling plugin load failures, Steam overlay not working with Wayland, etc.).</p>
<p>The situation is promising now because it looks like the pending issues from Wayland are being addressed and the developers are aware and doing their best to solve them. The PR that would revert the Wayland over X11 behaviour again got closed and the merge discarded with a new solution (and a new issue) proposed. <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345#issuecomment-2023112550" target="_blank">Quoting</a> Sam Lantinga: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the feedback everyone!</p>
<p>It sounds like the Wayland folks are aware of the issues and are making progress towards addressing them. I'll leave Wayland default for now while they are doing that, so it's easier for people to test and provide them feedback. We will re-evaluate this as we get closer to full release.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton" target="_blank">@Joshua-Ashton</a>, can you create individual issues that impact this and create a task list in the original merge request report, for tracking?</p>
<p>I'm going to lock this conversation for now so we can focus on development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345#issuecomment-2023413737" target="_blank">And</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the performance issues motivating this PR are resolved by the combination of fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1, let's check for those protocols before using Wayland by default.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton" target="_blank">@Joshua-Ashton</a>, I'll go ahead and close this PR. Can you open a new one implementing that?</p>
<p>For those following along, this change guarantees that high performance Vulkan applications like games have the best experience by default. Hopefully these protocols will land soon, but either way the user has final control over the backend being used, via the SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news that a mechanism was implemented and instead of dropping Wayland by default in all situations, this will only happen after checking fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 protocols.</p>
<p>Feel free to follow-up on that subject by tracking the freshly created issue: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9383" target="_blank"> video: Only prefer Wayland if fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 are available #9383</a></li>

      <title>EA anticheat arrives for Battlefield V in April, will break it on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from adding EA anticheat into FIFA 23, Battlefield 2042 and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 we're about to see another game broken on Linux / Steam Deck with Battlefield V.</p>
<p>Released today is a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-5/news/eaac-and-battlefield" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Battlefield website, which mentions the previous implementation for Battlefield 2042 but now it confirms Battlefield V will also be getting it in April. The post doesn't say the exact date, but the official X account <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1773001536206999598" target="_blank">posted</a> it will be live on April 3rd at 8AM UTC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11846028811711561472gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11846028811711561472gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A shame to see more games get it, as there will be no option at all to play it on Linux and Steam Deck because EA AntiCheat simply doesn't support it at all. It's a kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution made in-house by EA, which is especially problematic.</p>
<p>Released back in 2018, Battlefield V still has plenty of players, with it hitting a peak of 38,736 in the last 24 hours on Steam.</p>
<p>Hopefully EA don't add it into Apex Legends which currently uses Easy Anti-Cheat that's enabled for Linux, as that will be a big loss, but no word on that so far.</p>

      <title>4D Golf is making my brain melt away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released on March 22nd, 4D Golf is about exploring higher dimensions through Golf. It's absolutely wild visually and I think you need to see this. It's making my brain go "what the fuck?".</p>
<p>The developer describes it as "a mind-bending golf game unlike any other because it's set entirely in a 4-dimensional space. Complete fun and unique golfing challenges as you gain hands-on experience of the 4th dimension and beyond!" but uh, no amount of screenshots or descriptions will do the weirdness justice, just check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y53UNskR-zU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27daccf0198d3359bd8e1b16ea9096dc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y53UNskR-zU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And for a little more the developer did a quick talk on the journey:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 120 levels and 7 vibrant themed worlds.</li>
<li>Tons of visualization options to master 4D space.</li>
<li>Build your own 4D courses in the level editor.</li>
<li>Race the clock in Marble Platforming Mode.</li>

      <title>Now you too can lose all your time in Lost For Swords with the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/ive-spent-way-too-much-time-playing-lost-for-swords/" target="_blank">Back in July 2023</a> I wrote about Lost For Swords, a roguelike deck-builder, where the cards in your deck shape the rooms you’re exploring. It was properly good fun and now it has a Native Linux demo too!</p>
<p>The developer is bringing it over from itch.io to Steam, and they gave it the Linux treatment recently as well. Reaching out to me recently to note since the last time I tried, it was on itch.io for either Windows or to play via the web. The game has expanded a lot since I last tried it too - great to see.</p>
<p>In Lost For Swords you make your way up the tower, equip weapons and armour, cast spells and scrolls, activate auras, collect loot and fight the monsters on each floor. The fun hook here is that your equipment, and the cards of the dungeon itself are all shuffled and place on the board making it unique each time. Equipment you pick up can only be used once too, so it's all about planning ahead. A really clever concept that works quite well and really sucks away time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deck Building and Playstyles:</strong> build and refine your deck as you fight your way up the towers. Choose wisely and craft the best deck from 100+ available cards. Play offensive or defensive, sneaky or powerful, deliberate or reckless. You decide!</li>
<li><strong>Simple UI, Complex Strategy:</strong> every single one of your actions is a simple click. No inventory management, no menus, no card dragging, no busywork. Just pure turn based strategy and tactics!</li>
<li><strong>Roguelike Runs:</strong> choose a hero and ascend the floors of a tower that is ever-changing. No two runs are the same. How far can you make it?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 playable characters</strong>, each with 100+ cards</li>
<li>multiple unlockable <strong>alternative starter decks</strong> for each character</li>
<li><strong>6 distinct towers</strong> with unique monsters, traps and bosses</li>
<li><strong>quests and random encounters</strong>, which can change the course of a run</li>
<li><strong>level editor</strong> with the ability to share and play other's levels</li>
<li>lots of <strong>difficulty modifiers</strong> to challenge all kinds of players</li>
</ul>

<p>Another fun game made in Godot Engine too!</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky 4.6 &#39;Orbital&#39; adds starship customization and a space station overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>God damn this sounds great. No Man's Sky just got another free huge upgrade in update 4.6 "Orbital" that comes with a bunch of big new features.</p>
<p>While No Man's Sky had a lot of ships you could acquire and that was great, the customisation needed a boost and Hello Games have firmly delivered with the option to create a completely custom ship now too. You can also now disassemble starships, to give you components for making those custom starships.</p>
<p>Space stations also went through a huge redesign that improves on every part of them. Not just that, space station interiors are also now procedurally generated giving you lots of different types to explore.</p>
<p>There's also improved screen space reflections, a trade surge system to help you find good deals, fleets of frigates engaged in interstellar expeditions may reach out for help, a station merchant refresh, various space station base parts can now be used for building, various UI improvements like a new main menu, you can now easily swap your primary ship in a space station and lots more.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/orbital-update/" target="_blank">full update notes</a>. Clearly this is not the last update either, as once again they're saying "more will follow", so I can only imagine what they've got cooking up next.</p>

      <title>Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy from the ATOM RPG team has a demo and Kickstarter live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the post-apocalyptic ATOM RPG have launched a demo and crowdfunding campaign for Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy, a fantasy cRPG inspired by Infinity Engine titles like Baldur's Gate 1, Icewind Dale and other classics. Just like their previous games it will have Linux support too.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WBEAV8_CvrE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a671b4eab9e9d96b2ab5a03a97b03705.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WBEAV8_CvrE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A flexible combat engine. Experience battle as a tactician in turn-based combat, or hasten the pace with the real-time with pause (RTwP) mode.</li>
<li>A classless roleplaying system: each stat combination provides a distinctive gaming experience, exclusive dialogues, and novel ways to solve quests.</li>
<li>A classics-inspired yet modern User Interface with many Quality of Life improvements from our contemporaries;</li>
<li>A vast, nonlinear world filled with unique NPCs and multi-solution quests that reward exploration, always offering alternative approaches to satisfy any character build.</li>
<li>Dozens of hours of exploration, from quiet village hamlets to hidden temples of the ancients, horrid crypts, bizarre dungeons, and otherworldly locales.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With it being on Kickstarter they have a minimum funding goal of €36,000 and considering they're a proven developer, along with this genre getting a nice boost from Baldur's Gate recently it's likely to get funded quite easily.</p>
<p>Check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108180/Swordhaven_Iron_Conspiracy/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now and the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atomrpg/swordhaven-iron-conspiracy" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> to help fund it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma app Ark gets support for self-extracting .exe archive files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another of their regular update blog posts, KDE's Nate Graham has highlighted some recent new KDE Plasma features coming soon to the desktop.</p>
<p>With the latest <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/03/22/this-week-in-kde-4/" target="_blank">blog post</a> the first noted item might have a lot of uses! As Ark, the KDE file compression/decompression utility, can now open and un-archive self-extracting .exe archive files. There's a lot of installers out there for games, mods and plenty more that use this and so just being able to extract them simply on KDE Plasma with Ark sounds really useful. This will come with Ark version 24.05.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11223387071711464261gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some more work is going into tweaking the Plasma UI too including showing you shortcuts over menu items, like middle click for opening a file in the first entry inside the "Open With" menu. That simple but useful change is coming with Dolphin 24.05.</p>
<p>They've also made the floating panel’s float/de-float animation smoother when using a scale factor, in Plasma's global Edit Mode you can now click anywhere on a panel to show that panel’s own configuration dialog, entries in the System Settings Autostart page are now sorted alphabetically and more.</p>
<p>Lots of bug fixes coming too as the clean-up continues from the main Plasma 6 release. Like a fix to relax KWin's requirement on Wayland that XWayland windows can only put content on the clipboard when they have keyboard focus, as this was not a requirement on X11 and enforcing it was breaking some XWayland-using apps.</p>
<p><em>Have you made the jump to Plasma 6 yet? Or are you waiting for a bit for bug fixes to roll in?</em></p>

      <title>Sci-fi deck-builder Hyperspace Deck Command has a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hyperspace Deck Command is the next game in the Hyperspace Anthology from Sleeper Games that includes their two previous games Swirl W@tch and ---Red---Tether--&gt;.</p>
<p>It's a a sci-fi card-battler deck-building roguelite where you deploy spaceships that operate on individual turn timers, combine a wide variety of cards into powerful decks and master the dual-use status effects to defeat the hegemonising swarm.</p>
<p>Check out the previous teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aBZprZeheIE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b38a7283243dbea7b03bf64f27be5c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aBZprZeheIE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the demo the developer said via email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the demo you can fight your way through 5 different simulation encounters using a randomized starter deck, with units that operate on individual turn timers and tech that works differently depending on if you play it against allies or enemies. To beat the final endurance battle you will need a powerful fleet and proper mastery of the game’s dual-use status effect system.</p>
<p>In the full game you will also be able to build widely different decks by combine ships and technologies of various factions. And you will explore remote star systems to uncover cards, upgrades and increasingly harsh enemy encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect your fabricator megaship from waves of advancing enemies in tactical, card-based combat.</li>
<li>Deploy and move your space forces across multiple orbital lanes.</li>
<li>Use high-tech ability cards to support your vessels in battle.</li>
<li>Carefully consider your actions: Units operate on individual turn timers and every card you play brings them closer to carrying out their next attack run.</li>
<li>Combine dozens of possible fabricators, deck commanders, randomly generated flagships and auxiliary vessels into thousands of possible starting decks.</li>
<li>Modify individual cards with stackable upgrades or augment your entire fleet with powerful artifact tech.</li>
<li>Explore star systems to collect new ships and technology cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's planned to release in full later this year.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2711190/Hyperspace_Deck_Command/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Nova, a Rust-based Linux driver for NVIDIA GPUs announced</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Danilo Krummrich who is a Red Hat display driver team Software Engineer, announced the Nova project, a Rust-based GSP-only driver for Nvidia GPUs. Nova, in the long term, is intended to serve as the successor of Nouveau for GSP-firmware-based GPUs.</p>
<p>Quoting his email from the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/Zfsj0_tb-0-tNrJy@cassiopeiae/" target="_blank">dri-devel mailist</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Nova we see the chance to significantly decrease the complexity of the driver compared to Nouveau for mainly two reasons. First, Nouveau's historic architecture, especially around nvif/nvkm, is rather complicated and inflexible and requires major rework to solve certain problems (such as locking hierarchy in VMM / MMU code for VM_BIND currently being solved with a workaround) and second, with a GSP-only driver there is no need to maintain compatibility with pre-GSP code.</p>
<p>Besides that, we also want to take the chance to contribute to the Rust efforts in the kernel and benefit from more memory safety offered by the Rust programming language. Ideally, all that leads to better maintainability and a driver that makes it easy for people to get involved into this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please look at the full email for more details on this matter.</p>
<p>Nova is aiming to be a modern replacement for Nouveau and focus on developing a driver from the ground without the legacy that comes with that older opensource driver, and focusing on GPUs that are newer than the RTX 2000 series which have a better GSP(GPU System Processor) support, while non-GSP GPUs were always tricky to deal with. This driver will also indirectly boost the morale of those trying to develop Rust-based drivers for Linux by providing examples for those who want to be involved in developing kernel technology using that language.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Nouveau will die soon, since it will still handle older GPUs that do not rely on GSP for hardware initialization and management, and we see a loot of improvement with NVK lately.</p>
<p>As for today, the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/nova" target="_blank">Nova repository</a> is looking really active and promising although the README file states that there is still a lot to be done until this driver can be considered ready for production use.</p>

      <title>Orange Pi Neo Linux gaming handheld starts at $499 with Ryzen 7840U, Ryzen 8840U at $599</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" target="_blank">revealed early in February</a>, the upcoming Orange Pi Neo that will come with Manjaro Linux now has a price, and there will be multiple versions of it although we still don't exactly have a clear release date.</p>
<p>The Manjaro Linux account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/ManjaroLinux/status/1772066928774848973" target="_blank">posted</a> that it was "launched" in Shenzhen, China. The device will be split across a Ryzen 7840U model at $499 USD and a Ryzen 8840U at $599 USD. It will join the Steam Deck in being powered by Linux, although not SteamOS, it will use a special immutable Manjaro Gaming Edition. Although if you don't get on with Manjaro, there's other options like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> that will no doubt get drivers sorted for it.</p>

      <title>GOG begin funding indie devs with Loco Motive releasing this Summer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that they're getting into game funding, with the first partnership being a boost for developers from Robust Games and publisher Chucklefish for their upcoming title Loco Motive.</p>
<p>An interesting move, and not exactly unusual really when you think about it. GOG run a games store, if they think funding specific games that will release on GOG will increase sales — why not do it? Loco Motive is a game I actually wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/check-out-the-free-wonderful-point-and-click-mystery-comedy-loco-motive/" target="_blank">back in early 2021</a> due to the impressively styled free Game Jam version, which has a Native Linux version, although it looks like the full release will not so you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>. The developers say they've tested the game on the Steam Deck and "it works well!".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LEFo5Jfa0lw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9720ab654186b03a9392b0f4d089398f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LEFo5Jfa0lw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We believe in game preservation – in every form. Where there is passion and love for gaming, we want to go there! Be it bringing back classic titles, making them playable, reviving unlisted gems… Or supporting the creation of new indie games, such as Robust Games’ Loco Motive" - Bartosz Kwietniewski, Head of Business Development at GOG</p>
<p>"As a small independent studio, we were thrilled to forge this partnership with GOG. We deeply value and appreciate the trust GOG place in us as their first investment into indies, and I'm confident that with their collaboration and support we will reach new heights of success." - Adam Riches, Co-Founder of Robust Games</p>
<p>I did shoot off an email to GOG PR about this, asking more questions about how this partnership actually works for GOG but they have not replied as of time of publishing. See GOG's <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/coming_soon_gog_chucklefish_and_robust_games_team_up_for_the_upcoming_game" target="_blank">announcement</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 increases vm.max_map_count for smoother Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At last! Users from Ubuntu 24.04 onwards that's scheduled to release on April 25th should hopefully see a smoother Linux gaming experience.</p>
<p>There's been an issue for quite some time now in various Linux distributions where the value of vm.max_map_count is too low, which is by default set to 65530, and this causes a whole bunch of games to crash. Fedora <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/IncreaseVmMaxMapCount" target="_blank">changed</a> this to a default of 1048576 back with Fedora Linux 39 and now it's the turn for Ubuntu to do the same.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2057792" target="_blank">bug report</a>, it's been noted that a fix has been committed for Ubuntu 24.04 in the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/procps/2:4.0.4-4ubuntu2" target="_blank">procps</a> package that will now match the value that Fedora is using.</p>
<p>Some of the games that can be affected by it include The Finals, which I actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-finals-freezing-on-linux-heres-ways-you-can-fix-it/" target="_blank">wrote about with this issue</a>, and others including Counter Strike 2, Hogwarts Legacy, DayZ, and basically anything that might be invoking a lot of mmaps. Some specific games may still need a higher value, but at least bumping up the default will leave room for more games to actually work properly.</p>
<p>It's such a small change, but the benefit will be huge for an overall smoother gaming experience.</p>

      <title>Trackline Express is a bit like Unrailed! with even more chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackline Express is a train and track building game from Bubblebird Studio that's planned to release on April 18th, and it sure does look like some wonderful chaos. From the same developer that created the chilled Haven Park.</p>
<p>Very much in a similar spirit as Unrailed!, which is an absolute gem, but here it's even more crazy in a few ways. You're not just building up tracks constantly here though, instead the focus is more on building up your train (but you can put down more tracks too). There's a fair bit of crafting, frequent attacks to fight off and you even get to be creative with having your passengers help you out all while trying to get the train to the next station. </p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>High replay value.</li>
<li>Many items to gather and craft.</li>
<li>Multiple game modes.</li>
<li>Online and local (LAN) multiplayer mode (experimental).</li>
<li>Mini quests to complete.</li>
<li>Random deterministic map generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2343920/Trackline_Express/" target="_blank">follow on Steam and there's a demo</a> available along with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Check out tactical dice-rolling roguelike combat in Slice &amp; Dice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slice &amp; Dice from developer Tann has recently arrived on Steam giving players a fresh tactical dice-rolling roguelike, along with Native Linux support. This looks like Slay the Spire meets dice instead of cards, so if that sounds like your sort of thing it might be time to go and pick up a new game.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k5UBfPwqp7s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8aa2f4a4ee28e3cb91d4d6f06883f955.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k5UBfPwqp7s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3D dice physics, choose which dice to reroll.</li>
<li>Simple turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Level up a hero or gain an item after each fight.</li>
<li>Randomly-generated encounters.</li>
<li>Ridiculous combos.</li>
<li>Undo actions as much as you like.</li>
<li>Each turn is like a mini-puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>128 hero classes (+99999?).</li>
<li>73 monsters.</li>
<li>473 items.</li>
<li>Too many modes.</li>
<li>∞ curses.</li>
<li>Weird modding.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a demo available too but it looks like their Native Linux version has issues launching. It uses Java, so simply running the jar file <em>directly</em> with system-installed Java works. Or, you can just use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> for now. They may need to add a launch script to actually use their bundled Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for the Linux version. I've let the developer know.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1775490/Slice__Dice/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cinematic narrative adventure Until Then releases May 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Polychroma Games and Maximum Entertainment have announced the cinematic narrative adventure Until Then is going to release on May 23rd.</p>
<p>More: "A fateful meeting sets off a chain reaction, upending Mark's life. People disappear and memories prove unreliable. Uncover a hidden truth with Mark and his friends in this narrative adventure and race to unravel the mystery before it's too late."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer as this looks like something quite special:</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what to expect from that trailer, but overall it looks quite gorgeous. Almost Anime like in a way, and with the mix of perspectives here it will probably be quite interesting to play through.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play out your own adventure.</li>
<li>Investigate the setting through everyday technology.</li>
<li>Explore themes of love, loss, and friendship.</li>
<li>Play addictively mundane mini-games.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a cinematic visual experience.</li>

      <title>SDL 3 has a first preview release out with HDR and Vulkan for the 2D rendering API</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fun times ahead for game developers, as the very popular SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) has a preview of the upcoming SDL 3 now available for feedback and testing.</p>
<p>What is SDL used for? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware on many different platforms like Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 24th, Sam Lantinga of Valve <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/prerelease-3.1.0" target="_blank">announced</a> the preview.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of SDL 3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The API has been significantly reworked to be easier to use and more consistent</li>
<li>The 2D rendering API now has support for more advanced colorspaces and HDR rendering</li>
<li>The 2D rendering API now has a Vulkan backend</li>
<li>An example of hardware accelerated video playback using ffmpeg has been added in test/testffmpeg.c</li>
<li>The shaped window API has been replaced with transparent windows</li>
<li>Time and date functions have been added in SDL_time.h</li>
<li>Support for webcam video capture has been added in SDL_camera.h</li>
<li>Support for handling pens and tablets has been added in SDL_pen.h</li>
<li>Support for file open and save dialogs has been added in SDL_dialog.h</li>
<li>Cross-platform functions for working with files and directories are available in SDL_filesystem.h</li>
<li>A cross-platform abstraction for working with user and game data has been added in SDL_storage.h</li>
<li>Handling of main() has been moved to a header library and an optional callback-based program flow is available</li>
<li>Support for simple object properties has been added in SDL_properties.h. These properties are available on many SDL objects, and can be used for more advanced functionality.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, one thing that <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345" target="_blank">seems to be changing</a>, is moving the default back to X11 instead of Wayland due to various issues that need solving.</p>

      <title>Mini Airways is like Mini Metro / Mini Motorways but for aircraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a interesting take on the strategy management sim? Taking a heavy dose of inspiration and naming from the very popular Mini Metro and Mini Motorways, a completely different developer is doing their take with Mini Airways. CCC Games are clearly big fans of the work from Dinosaur Polo Club.</p>
<p>It's a real-time management game with an air traffic control theme, as you continually expand and things can get a little busy with tons of planes taking off, landing and hopefully not crashing into each other. Actually seems like quite a nice take on it, and the developer recently added Native Linux support to the demo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vsy5-zrTI8A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3ee98bd57e32bfa3d1f2d2efcd07bda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vsy5-zrTI8A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They might need to work on the English text a little, but hey at least with a demo you can provide some feedback on that.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2289650/Mini_Airways/" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>. It's due to release sometime in Q3 this year.</p>

      <title>MangoHud manager GOverlay 1.1.1 released upgrading to QT6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOverlay, the app you can use if you want a UI to manage overlays like MangoHud has a new release out that upgrades its insides and fixes some bugs. While MangoHud is pretty darn easy to configure, since it's just a text file, GOverlay is useful for those who just quickly want to tick some boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20933382701711359981gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20933382701711359981gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What the developer said has been improved in 1.0.1 and 1.1.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New: We've given our toolkit a snazzy upgrade to QT6.</li>
<li>New: Check out our shiny new icon and application logo!</li>
<li>FIX: Say goodbye to issues with changing FPS color—it now saves your config like a champ.</li>
<li>FIX: That pesky pcidev config option? Yeah, it's sticking around now.</li>
<li>FIX: Ever set AF filter or Mipmap filter to 0 and felt like it did nothing? Fear not, they'll now actually disable those filters as intended.</li>
<li>FIX: No more wandering windows—the main goverlay window now sits smack dab in the center of your desktop.</li>
<li>Cheers to smoother sailing and more streamlined experiences ahead!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Nature-expanding tile-stacking puzzler &#39;Preserve&#39; has a demo up on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preserve looks very sweet. A tile-based puzzle game all about nature that features both horizontal and vertical building and there's a Native Linux demo now available to try out. The idea of connecting up a vertical network of interconnected habitats seems like a genuinely great idea for this.</p>
<p>More: "Preserve is a puzzle nature-building game that takes players on a journey into a harmonious ecosystem. The objective is to foster and sustain a thriving and diverse biomes, where each component coexists in a symbiotic harmony. By utilizing strategic thinking and a keen eye for balance, players are granted the power to position a wide array of plants and animals, curating an environment that caters to their preferences and aspirations."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Eldmbodjqzc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b274e07786a3a3cee8ebb7c17867eb17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Eldmbodjqzc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical map expansion - In Preserve, you can expand the map not only horizontally, but you also posses an ability to stack layers of nature, forming a vertical network of interconnected habitats.</li>
<li>Diverse biome habitats - From alpine forests and savannas to carribean reefs, each biome will have its own unique set of plants, animals, and environmental challenges to discover and overcome.</li>
<li>Multiple Game Modes - Besides regular harmony and puzzle game modes, creative mode lets you build the land without limitations and photo mode allows you to capture and share your creations at the end of each session.</li>
