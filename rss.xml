      <title>Temtem: Swarm developers highlight their work on Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Temtem: Swarm, the spin-off from Crema and GGTech Studios from the original online creature-collector Temtem, seems like it's going to have great Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>This time around, the developers are jumping into the ever-increasing survivor-like genre made popular by Vampire Survivors with their own unique spin on it. They've taken the simple classic survivor gameplay but added in their strategy-based combat mechanics where you and up to 3 others can play together online alongside creatures from the Temtem universe.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2510960/view/4355628027405250446" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam today the developers highlighted their work to ensure it works well: "Our clever little monkeys have been working tirelessly to make sure the game feels great in your hands. The game's interface scales beautifully to the Deck's screen, so you can keep track of your Temtem squad and the incoming enemy hordes with ease. And of course, full controller support lets you unleash your inner swarm-battling master without ever needing to touch a keyboard."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10201465331722433312gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10201465331722433312gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since there's going to be a lot going on, they needed to make sure the game performed well and in some cases it didn't. So they went into a bit of detail on how they've been making sure that it does:</p>
<p>"You might be asking yourself how we got hundreds of detailed Temtem models to show on the screen without making the system crash and burn. For that we relied on the amazing TechArt and Programming teams to find ways to make the magic happen.</p>
<p>Normally, Temtem are animated using skeletons, but with so many animated characters on screen at once this can really slow things down. So, we used a special technique to bake animations into textures which allowed us to have the graphics card (GPU) handle those animations. This frees up the processor (CPU) for other tasks, like enemy behavior and executing your attacks, dashes, and movements.</p>
<p>The VFX teams were also responsible for making a ton of beautiful animations with eye-catching particle effects for the pick-up items. There can be a lot of those items on the screen at once - especially after Platypet’s Tsunami goes off! Those animations and particles were being handled by the CPU, but using a similar technique, they made it so that the process could be handled by the GPU instead.</p>
<p>On the programming side of things, we noticed the game was chugging a bit when players were going wild at the same time, especially when the host of a co-op game was on the Steam Deck. Turns out, one of the plugins we were using wasn't built for such chaotic fun! The team cooked up some special tweaks just for the Steam Deck, and voila! The game runs like a dream, even with a whole crew of players causing mayhem.</p>
<p>All of this means that the swarm can be larger, drop more items, and chase you harder all while the Steam Deck runs like a dream. We have even more we can optimize, so we’ll keep pushing to have the best experience possible!"</p>
<p>Even as a non-developer, I definitely enjoy seeing game developers note down specifically what they're doing, it makes for a fun read. And, testing performance against the Steam Deck is just a great idea, because it gives you a decent target to optimise for that then benefits all players.</p>
<p>There's currently no release date other than Q4 2024, and they said in the post it's a few months away still. Check out the previous trailer:</p>

      <title>Super cosy slice of life sim The Garden Path is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b_1IIWdvFzo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/04278dc1a7bc410589533031886c81db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b_1IIWdvFzo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>More about the developer: Founded in Bristol, UK in 2016 by illustrator Louis Durrant, carrotcake previously developed the beautiful European fable Crossing to the Cold Valley, and Kingdom Ka, an abstract retelling of the world’s oldest stories, prior to their work on The Garden Path. Durrant is a one-person development team, whose primary goal is to build spaces that people want to exist in. With The Garden Path, that mantra can be seen in every facet of the game. Growing up watching the Moomins and Studio Ghibli films, Durrant credits both works as inspirations for The Garden Path.</p>
<p>There were some initial Steam Deck issues for this one, but the developer has already done a couple of quick patches so it should be okay now.</p>
<p>You can buy it with Native Linux support from <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1638500/The_Garden_Path/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Core Ultra Lunar Lake launches September 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Intel are currently battling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issues</a> with their crashing 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, they're now planning to launch Intel Core Ultra Lunar Lake in September.</p>
<p>In a short press release Intel said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahead of the IFA 2024 conference, join Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group, and Jim Johnson, senior vice president and general manager of the Client Business Group, and Intel partners as they launch the next generation of Intel® Core™ Ultra processors, code-named Lunar Lake.</p>
<p>During the livestreamed event, they will reveal details on the new processors’ breakthrough x86 power efficiency, exceptional core performance, massive leaps in graphics performance and the unmatched AI computing power that will drive this and future generations of Intel products.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sept. 3 at 6 p.m. CEST (9 a.m. PDT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm especially interested to see how the new Xe2 GPU performs, we're really getting to a golden age of machines that don't really need a big fat dedicated GPU to run a huge amount of games. Just look at the Steam Deck and what it achieved. And as always, the industry moves quickly and we're about to get another interesting boost. See more<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/intel-revealed-more-lunar-lake-processor-details-with-their-new-xe2-graphics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Lunar Lake details in my previous article</a>.</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Megapicker has been corrupting some Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of an oops here with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/grab-a-free-copy-of-drawful-2-now-that-the-jackbox-megapicker-is-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly released The Jackbox Megapicker</a>, with the Native Linux version causing the Steam Deck to get corrupted.</p>
<p>There were reports floating around in places like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1efm0fp/the_jackbox_megapicker_might_have_seriously/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, with people discussing it in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Discord</a> as well. This has caused the Jackbox team to now post on their Steam forum <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2828500/discussions/0/4513254562066220587/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re so excited to have The Jackbox Megapicker out in the world for our fans to enjoy. Unfortunately at this time, we’ve seen a handful of reports come in regarding issues with the Megapicker on Steam Decks.</p>
<p>Our engineering and QA teams are working hard to resolve this issue, and hope to get everyone back to gaming in no time.</p>
<p>However, it is our current recommendation that Steam Deck users refrain from downloading The Jackbox Megapicker until further notice. We hope to be able to resolve this issue ASAP.</p>
<p>If you are currently having issues with The Jackbox Megapicker on Steam Deck, please reach out to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.jackboxgames.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://support.jackboxgames.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais has also <a href="https://x.com/Plagman2/status/1818574815412076947" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (Twitter) to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hotfix has been issued to select Proton by default for the Jackbox Megapicker until the issues with corrupting the Steam installation are addressed. To avoid issues, don't override the compatibility selection to the Linux Runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite a big problem that a single game could cause your Steam Deck to be unusable without re-doing the whole SteamOS install. Hopefully Valve will be looking into how this was ever possible, to get the Steam Client and SteamOS to be protected against such issues in future.</p>

      <title>Steam will now show you who is playing on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Steam Client Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck, Valve will actually show you who is gaming on a Steam Deck. A small cosmetic change, but a fun one for Steam Deck fans.</p>
<p>This is only for the Beta (and Preview on Steam Deck too) currently, that will eventually roll out for everyone into a stable update.</p>
<p>From the Desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4329732963499546524" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The friends list will now show a Steam Deck icon, instead of a gamepad icon, if the other user is playing on a Steam Deck</li>
<li>Replaced the friends list VR icon with a new graphic that also matches the in-game or online friend state color</li>
<li>Fixed a few spots where tooltips were causing unexpected word wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recordings &amp; Screenshots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed error that could happen when opening the Recordings &amp; Screenshots dialog before necessary data had loaded in</li>
<li>Improved search filter behavior in the game selector dropdown in the Recordings &amp; Screenshots dialog</li>
<li>Added support for "Send to Phone" share option to screenshots</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From my own friend list for example, spot the one currently on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13864361971722428585gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And then these below are specifically from the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4361258160890095013" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Game Recording Beta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed instances of failing to capture video data after multiple game launches.</li>
<li>Fixed cropped video capture when an external display is connected or disconnected after startup.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Enshrouded gets AMD FSR 3 and Steam Deck stability and performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Might be time to jump back into Enshrouded, as it should run better than ever no matter what system you're on, but especially Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>The Enshrouded: Back to the Shroud update landed yesterday bringing with it the headline feature of difficulty presets, so you can tweak the experience you want to your liking. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4361257526928448831" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lots more</a> tweaks and changes but crucially, performance <em>should</em> be quite a bit improved. Something that was needed, as it many cases it was quite bad.</p>
<p>In the changelog they noted improved "stability and performance on lower hardware specs and on the Steam Deck", there's an updated default settings for Steam Deck as well and they've added in AMD FSR 3 now too. The crafting menu also has larger preview images, so it should look better on smaller screens now too.</p>
<p>Other than that there's plenty of new additions to the world, new character customization options and lots more. Check out the trailer:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Jackbox Megapicker</a> is a launcher to bring together the many party games that Jackbox Games, Inc. have created to help get your party started. It's out now, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/442070/Drawful_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drawful 2</a> is free until August 28th.</p>
<p>So even if you don't currently own any Jackbox party games, you can at least put Drawful 2 in the bag. The Jackbox Megapicker is free as well, because it's just a fancy launcher to get you into games easier across their <em>many</em> packs and get you to hopefully buy some more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10988524981722350678gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jackbox Megapicker is your all-in-one solution for organizing, buying, and launching all of your Jackbox games. You no longer have to switch between Party Packs to start playing your favorite games. The Megapicker will give you an overview of the games that you own so you can launch them directly. View games you might be missing, and see news updates and ongoing sales all in one place. Filter your games by genre and create an account to store your preferences and see your game history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To go along with it they're also running a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/jackboxfranchisesale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Franchise Sale</a> on Steam so you can pick up some of their games and packs for quite a lot cheaper.</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play app gets renamed to chiaki-ng (chiaki-next-generation)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What was originally called chiaki4deck, a lot of people thought it was primarily aimed at PlayStation Remote Play for Steam Deck but they've now rebranded to chiaki-ng (chiaki-next-generation).</p>
<p>This is because it's a fork of the original chiaki, which is no longer maintained and this version is far ahead of it. So this change is to better align that the project is actually designed to support PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 Remote Play for Linux (and Steam Deck of course), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Android, macOS, Windows and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub URL</a> has changed, and so has the <a href="https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki-ng/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website documentation</a>. And they have a fancy new logo too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1552405641722350872gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A couple of releases have also been made since I last wrote about it including this rebrand release (v1.8) which also noted this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes current profile when using --profile option.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also 1.7.4 from last week which noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>adds notification when psn creds expire.</li>
<li>use IPv4 for hostnames as ps4/5 don't support using IPv6 for remote play.</li>
<li>allow entering pin using enter key as alternative to selecting ok.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Alien: Rogue Incursion (VR) looks like it will turn me into a nervous wreck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm looking forward to playing through another proper single-player VR game, and it looks like Alien: Rogue Incursion may be my next big one. That is, as long as SteamVR with the Valve Index on Linux is in a good enough state to run it when it releases late this year.</p>
<p>A new trailer went live showcasing the protagonist and some actual gameplay too check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="49WAFl7u6gA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f09e28d7ffd07eb59cacbfe167b551ec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/49WAFl7u6gA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Having to pull up the motion scanner is absolutely going to wreck my heart. I'm not <em>entirely</em> sold on the visuals just yet, but in VR it's a whole different feeling and it's still in development so hopefully they will keep improving on that.</p>
<p>They said it will be available "this Holiday" so likely sometime in December.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE ALIEN UNIVERSE</strong><br/>
Experience the horror and challenge of fighting Xenomorphs in a world inspired by the look and feel of the Alien film franchise. Audio, Visuals, Lighting, FX, Interaction, and Haptics work together to plunge players into the terrifying world of Alien.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE</strong><br/>
Xenomorphs can intelligently use the environment to find the best angle of attack and appear from anywhere around you. Playing in VR will test your nerves and skill as you feel the pulse-pounding terror of facing off against Xenomorphs. In addition to weapons and gear, your resourcefulness, quick reflexes, and ability to stay cool under terrifying pressure is needed to survive.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>MISTAKES ARE DEADLY</strong><br/>
Combat is dynamic and can happen (or not) based on Player actions, and the moment you don’t respect Xenomorphs is the minute you die in a gory mess. Spawning is reactive to the players movements. Make a lot of noise, and you are calling the Xenomorphs to you. In combat with Xenomorphs, death is very much an inevitable reality.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ICONIC WEAPONS AND GEAR</strong><br/>
Locate hotspots with your Motion Tracker. Unleash a hailstorm of bullet fire with your Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, and more from your arsenal to battle the Perfect Organism.</p>

      <title>Combining exploration, city-building and complex resource management, Scorchlands 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Native Linux support and full Steam Deck support with the 1.0 release, Scorchlands has left Early Access. There's no Steam Deck rating just yet from Valve, but the developer made it clear the 1.0 update is "fully compatible with the Steam Deck" and they have "added full controller support and UI scaling to enhance the gameplay experience".</p>
<p>What is it? Well, it's kind of complicated to describe. It's a strategy game that has elements of a city builder, with complex resource management. Where you travel across the land to keep expanding much like you do in Factorio for example, you're not some nameless thing in the sky. Eventually you'll be transforming barren surfaces into meadows, forests, lakes and vibrant settlements. It's a real interesting mix and now has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hex grid-based city-building – construct various buildings in your colonies. Each structure's productivity depends on neighboring resources and other constructions.</li>
<li>Complex resource management – it’s not only about extracting materials. Scorchlands takes account of logistics – the movement of resources between colonies and combining them in robust processing chains. And yes, we move resources using LASERS!</li>
<li>Terraforming for the greater good – utilize magic and technology to change the biomes on procedurally generated maps and exploit the new environment to gain its unique resources.</li>
<li>Technology designed to give fun – there’s no fun in a sandbox, if you don’t have the toys to play with. The technology system in Scorchlands is key for player progression and new discoveries open up new ways to play with the game world.</li>
<li>Minimalistic combat system – when you get into a fight, positioning will be key. Destroy your enemies by surrounding them and placing your forces in optimal locations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Old School Rally now Steam Deck Verified with an impressive roadmap ahead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old School Rally released recently and it not only looks fantastic for retro rally fans, it's also now Steam Deck Verified. Valve did the verification on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/proton-9-0-2-brings-better-controller-support-in-launchers-more-playable-games-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9</a>, so desktop Linux users will be good to go as well!</p>
<p>With carefully crafted retro visuals, it looks straight out of the 90s and I love it.</p>
<p>The developer recently put up a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2824660/view/4328605968607182702" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of what's to come that includes custom car liveries, a photo mode, an arcade mode to race the AI, full replay and highlight reel support, a local co-op mode, Steam Workshop support and more. After release they're also looking to continue updates adding in more cars, stages and driver statistics.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RACE THE WORLD - With a variety of rally tracks from around the globe, race across different surfaces such as dirt, tarmac and snow and challenge your driving skills.</li>
<li>RALLY CARS - Choose from a diverse lineup of rally cars inspired by the legends of the past, each with unique characteristics and features.</li>
<li>LEADERBOARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS - Challenge other drivers from around the world and climb to the top of the leaderboards. Ready for more? Try to get all the achievements over the course of the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more and more games getting Steam Deck Verified so early like this. Old School Rally still has 6-10 months to go in Early Access yet.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It's currently in Early Access.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of Puzzledorf emailed in about their rather vibrant Sokoban-style game that recently added Native Linux support.

It has a nice, easy difficulty curve with puzzles designed to help teach people how to play the game. If you get stuck, the relaxing soundtrack will keep things chill, with calming waterfalls and colourful pixel art to stare at while you consider the solution."</p>

      <title>No Rest for the Wicked now Steam Deck Verified thanks to latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No Rest for the Wicked from Moon Studios GmbH and Private Division has been through another major upgrade, and thanks to it the game is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? From Moon Studios, the award-winning developers of Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes No Rest for the Wicked, a visceral, precision Action RPG set to reinvent the genre.</p>
<p>Yesterday, July 25th, The Crucible update landed for the game which Valve has now rated as Steam Deck Verified with Proton 9.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z7gSM3eMEEs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cf6056db2a82cd2121d1a965e8a859c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z7gSM3eMEEs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not surprising when you see just how many performance improvements it's seen in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduced CPU spikes occurring when loading new areas and content.</li>
<li>Reduced CPU spikes occurring when instantiating numerous visual effects and objects.</li>
<li>Reduced memory usage in various systems.</li>
<li>Improved our broad-phase culling pass, reducing CPU utilization.</li>
<li>Improved content loading sequencing to reduce cases of on-screen pop-in.</li>
<li>Improved particle simulation and rendering performance for various debris effects.</li>
<li>Improved mesh trail performance.</li>
<li>Improved cloth simulation performance.</li>
<li>Improved character animation system’s performance.</li>
<li>Improved CPU performance during cinematic sequences.</li>
<li>Reduced CPU overhead for physics simulation of clutter, debris and destructible objects.</li>
<li>Reduced CPU overhead for pre-placed corpses.</li>
<li>Reduced CPU overhead for animating objects’ visual properties.</li>
<li>Reduced CPU overhead for characters outside of the camera viewport.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally a dedicated Steam Deck improvement with "Updated resolution on Steam Deck button Icons" so now they should look a lot clearer.

      <title>Spinny Dungeon is an upcoming slot machine roguelite that might eat away your time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Spinny Dungeon won't suck away your money like a real slot machine, it will eat away your time. Certainly not the first to come up with the idea, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/luck-be-a-landlord-gives-slot-machines-a-little-deck-building-flavour/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luck be a Landlord</a> also a pretty great version of it.</p>
<p>This is a bit different though, not only is it based on slots, it's also an auto-battler as well. Talk about a true blend of genres here. More about it: "You were crawling through dungeons as usual. One dungeon... You saw a strange portal in the corner of the room and a huge button in front of it. You pressed that button. Then you pressed it again, and again, and again...</p>
<p>The Demon of the Slot Machine has sent his minions to find your soul. Stop these monsters before they reach the RED ZONE."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q-y_dH-b3TM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c668471645322802bc2a90ffabe6c62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q-y_dH-b3TM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build the perfect deck.</strong> Add weapons, plants, magic artifacts and companions to your deck of symbols. After each spin they will be randomly rearranged on the board.</li>
<li><strong>Don't starve.</strong> Picking a strong companion who eats too much can be fatal not only to your enemies but also to your run.</li>
<li><strong>Mana, gold or pure damage?</strong> It's hard to have plenty of all. So choose wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Learn new spells and upgrade the old ones.</strong> Defeating the boss at the end of the level will give you access to more powerful spells.</li>
<li><strong>Explore various play styles with different heroes.</strong> You can get rich by stealing gold from the foes or crush them instantly by blowing up your own symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Atone for your sins.</strong> The Demon of the Slot Machine knows that gambling is not your only sin. Every sin adds its own challenge. You need to complete all the challenges to free your soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Steam page it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837790/Spinny_Dungeon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Follow it along on Steam</a>. No release date set currently.</p>

      <title>Valve gives developers some big reasons to add a demo on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have overhauled the way game demos work on Steam in some big ways, and it sounds like a really good thing for both developers and players.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/6233628070477025190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam, demos can now have their own full store page. This allows developers to accurately describe the demo with what features the demo specifically offers, along with all the usual bits like trailers and screenshots. This will also display a banner linking back to the full game.</p>
<p>This also means you can directly follow a demo page, to be notified when it's actually live. Nice! It also gives players the ability to review the demo too.</p>
<p>Demos will also appear across Steam in various places, acting as if they're a free game. So you can expect to see them in charts like New &amp; Trending and across all the tags. This sounds good, but I imagine this will also increase the complaints from developers on their new releases being quickly pushed down by demo releases. Still, nice for players to find them easier.</p>
<p>Demos also have their behaviour tweaked for your Steam Library:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can add demos to your library without having to immediately install them. Just click on the new "add to library" button next to demos you may not be ready to install (while using the mobile app, for instance).</li>
<li>Demos can be installed even if you already own the full game. Primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos, but it will also help players more easily manage installing/uninstalling demos.</li>
<li>Demos can be explicitly removed from an account by right-clicking &gt; manage &gt; remove from account.</li>
<li>When a demo is uninstalled, it will automatically get removed from your library.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The 1.0 release for 7 Days to Die is finally here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day some thought would never come, 7 Days to Die 1.0 is officially out now with quite the price increase to go with it. Previously £18.99, it's now £37.99.</p>
<p>There's far too much new for me to list here but some highlights include a new HD character system, new player armour / clothing system, new animal models, a new challenge system, new vehicle models, world generation upgrades, new points of interest, new zombie variants and updates to existing zombie types, lighting graphics upgrades, various performance optimizations, the progression system was improved, an enhanced gore system, updated road decals, much improved gamepad support and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Lots more to be seen in the <a href="https://7daystodie.com/v1-0-official-release-notes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozBN-pEUBvo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30085c56f263127c5bdc4913e5ed1d3b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozBN-pEUBvo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">As a reminder, while technically it's released now and they've pushed it out of Early Access, it's not actually finished. They have a roadmap of big updates to come that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update 1 - Storm's Brewing - Q4 2024 - New Weather System and Biome Progression Overhaul, a Wardrobe System, Crossplay, new Zombie Stages, the Spawn Near Friend ability, Twitch Drops, outfit DLCs, and more.</li>
<li>Update 2 - A New Threat - Q2 2025 - UI / Menu overhaul, Bandits, Event System, New Quest Type</li>
<li>Update 3 - The Road Ahead - Q4 2025 - Trader Overhaul, Story Mode, Steam Workshop Support, New Quest Type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Native Linux version seems to run about the same as it usually does, which is nice to see they've kept up with all the updates over the years. The Steam Overlay wouldn't work for me normally, although it did when run via <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>. The OpenGL version also seems to have glitchy shadows, changing it over to Vulkan in the launcher seemed to fix that but they still have a note that the Vulkan version isn't fully supported.</p>

      <title>Truckful is a gorgeous looking trucking delivery game with something dark lurking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful has been announced by MythicOwl, who recently released the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/planetiles-is-a-beautiful-blend-of-tetris-and-dorfromantik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">really wonderful Planetiles</a> and Truckful looks like one not to be missed.</p>
<p>An adventure where you're basically a delivery driver where you run errands and quests for various villagers, but something strange is going on with an ancient mystery in the nearby old forest. Looks like a really fun and strange blend this one. Seems a bit like MudRunner for the trucking, but with an interesting sounding narrative to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11625476991721913452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From what they said it will be a test of your driving skills seeing you go through winding roads, dusty lowlands, and charming towns with an assortment of different goods that you'll need to take care of, with no two errands being the same. Eventually, you'll want to go off the beaten track to explore the ancient forest on the outskirts with its "dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadows… Explore hidden paths, navigate misty wetlands, and brave treacherous marshes and quicksands to uncover the truth beneath the branches".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sqss-pcgfXI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2a84120f3e4d95ea9abc350a59279744.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sqss-pcgfXI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Drive, upgrade and customize your pickup truck.</li>
<li>Pack the truck bed with cargo of all shapes and sizes.</li>
<li>Complete errands for villagers in need.</li>
<li>Enjoy a physics-based car handling gameplay.</li>
<li>Unravel the mystery of the old forest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fallout: London mod for Fallout 4 has released today on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fallout: London, the hotly anticipated game-changing mod for Fallout 4 is now finally available via GOG, because it's simply too big for modding sites. If you own Fallout 4 on GOG, you're good to go since GOG haven't updated to the "next-gen" version. If you have it on Steam, you'll need to downgrade to version 1.10.163.0.</p>
<p>More about it: "Fallout: London is an ambitious, trail-blazing DLC-sized mod for Fallout 4, Bethesda Game Studios’ 2015 post-apocalyptic RPG. Fallout: London stands apart from its contemporaries and offers an entirely new experience: setting a Fallout game outside of the United States. True to its moniker, Fallout: London takes place IN London. From stuffy parliamentary aristocrats to a resurrection of the Knights of the Round Table to an uncompromising cult of revolutionaries (and more!), Fallout: London embodies the history and aesthetics of London and puts an unmistakably nuclear spin on the beloved city."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rahBCfRdVac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d31c56e868b623119f20bc47b6e3e39.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rahBCfRdVac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently for Linux players, it seems a bit messy. I've been unable to use the Steam Downgrader for Linux from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1?tab=files" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus</a>, because the zip file just seems broken (I've let them know. <strong>Update: They fixed it</strong>). For GOG owners though, you should <em>hopefully</em> be able to download both Fallout 4 and London via the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: GOG kindly sent me a Fallout 4 key, so I'm testing via the Heroic Launcher. Downloading Fallout London and Fallout 4, setting them each to use GE-Proton 9-10 and then running Fallout London brings up the installer correctly. You'll need to manually pick the Fallout 4 location, as it won't find it automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19424880041721914701gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19424880041721914701gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5579382091721914703gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5579382091721914703gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Strangely, the Wine file-picker couldn't display my /home folder, so I also had to use the Winecfg button in Heroic's settings on Fallout London, to then manually add my /home folder where Fallout 4 is installed. Then it <em>was</em> able to find it properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15991875221721915555gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15991875221721915555gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then it will come up with their launcher once installed. And you just click Play on Fallout London from inside Heroic each time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15291156231721916511gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15291156231721916511gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears to work using the GOG version downloaded via Heroic. However, I'm not hearing any of the dialogue being spoken, which I've seen from videos elsewhere that there is voice-acting. Tested with both GE-Proton and Proton Experimental, and on both the audio just doesn't seem right. So we may need some Proton / Wine fixes for Fallout London to work properly.</p>

      <title>STALKER 2 delayed until November to fix unexpected anomalies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World have decided to again delay the release of STALKER 2, as it's simply not ready for the public yet.</p>
<p>So that gives Valve even more time to continue working on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to ensure it runs everything nicely. I imagine too much for the Steam Deck though, probably desktop Linux only for this one. Although, I've been surprised by a few bigger games so we'll have to see.</p>
<p>From the press release: “We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding - it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.” said Yevhen Grygorovych, Game Director at GSC Game World.</p>
<p>So now it's going to release November 20th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vxeGyXSM5Pc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3cf1e884422ce02c067ec050b24d96ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">We're going to get more info on August 12th though, as they will be doing a Developer Deep Dive in collab with Xbox that will go over never before seen content including:</p>
<ul>
<li>- Interviews and behind-the-scenes of the development process.</li>
<li>- Lots of new footage, including world overview, various locations, gameplay and cutscenes.</li>
<li>- A full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pre-order via:</p>

      <title>Hexis is a slightly chaotic spin on Tetris where blocks come in all directions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This isn't your classic Tetris, this is Hexis, a block-falling puzzle game about building up your high score but the blocks will come from all directions. <em>Note: key sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>It's a simple no-frills puzzle game, that succeeds at exactly what it describes. Blocks made of hexagons stitched together will come from the sides towards the center of the screen, initially quite slow but it will speed up. You'll need to fit them all together, to get them to vanish to build up your score before you pile them too close to the borders around the screen.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2G3Ck9vfcko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86b1b9dbb1e6377e7ce92d78c8c6337f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2G3Ck9vfcko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has the traditional line-building in such block-falling games, one feature added in recently is the addition of bonus lines where if you line up the colours exactly as shown, you'll get some extra points. Just a fun little extra challenge to it, but not necessary to do.</p>
<p>For those who find the main mode too easy, there's a couple of different modes where you'll have to think pretty darn fast with multiple blocks at a time. But the main mode is reasonably chilled.</p>
<p>Initially launched in June, the developer told me via email it was developed on Linux! Overall, it's a well-built puzzler to spend some chilled-out time with.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764350/Hexis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for MetalMercs with retro real-time tactical mech squad action</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MetalMercs could be a good one for those of you who love customizable mech combat action, and this time it's not turn-based it's actually real-time. The simplistic retro visuals will be an acquired taste though I think on this one but it seems like the gameplay will make up for it.</p>
<p>"Destroy. Salvage. Repair. Upgrade. PROFIT! MetalMercs offers a real-time tactical experience where you command your own mercenary outfit of mechs and mercs and adventure through randomly generated missions filled with rewards, glory, and bitter defeat."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0Pe2PT00GAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54a88f68ffae443b0fb8cd7a6c9cd468.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0Pe2PT00GAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Strategic Gameplay </strong>- Command your squad in battle and plan your tactics to dominate the battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Precision Strikes</strong> - Turn the tide and cripple enemies with called shots where YOU direct powerful attacks against your enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Salvage and Scrap</strong> - Make key choices between missions to salvage spare parts and mechs, or use your salvage rights to keep your mechs operational.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade and Customize</strong> - Earn cash and parts to upgrade your mechs, enhancing their capabilities with powerful weapons and advanced technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Missions</strong> - Each mission offers different objectives and outcomes based on your strategic choices and actions.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Depth</strong> - Every decision matters, from the deployment of forces to the management of resources, adding tension and importance to every action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does use some AI generation though, which the developer notes includes "This game currently uses some stand-in images created via generative AI. This includes some background screens, fluff images, and pilot portraits. All other gameplay visuals are manually crafted."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3045070/MetalMercs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a> with a Native Linux demo.</p>

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard gets Steam Deck Verified well ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's a lovely surprise. Dragon Age: The Veilguard just got Steam Deck Verified, showing that Valve have been testing it ready for the upcoming release. Testing was done on the latest stable version of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, which is currently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/proton-9-0-2-brings-better-controller-support-in-launchers-more-playable-games-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-2</a>.</p>
<p>A release date hasn't yet even been announced, we just know it will be sometime this "Fall", which is sometime between September - December, so that's <em>really</em> early for the testing to be done.</p>
<p>Good news, since this means it should work just fine on desktop Linux too since it will be run with Valve's Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CTNwHShylIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20d1ccf2f4f642b3eefd90bfa32ba547.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CTNwHShylIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>Will you be picking up Dragon Age: The Veilguard at release? I must admit, the Dragon Age games kind of flew past me. I've only played one of them and wasn't overly hooked on it. But since Baldur's Gate 3, I'm definitely into RPGs once again so maybe this time it will get me more into it after being refreshed by BG3.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: the developer <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1816511768044163410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on X (Twitter) that "the EA App will not be required to play the game". Great news!</p>

      <title>Top-down Terraria-like &#39;Necesse&#39; gets a huge graphics update on August 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necesse is an impressive game but the graphics were a bit on the plain side. This changes dramatically on August 10 with the exciting Graphics Update. Very much a play it as you want it game, a lot like a top-down Terraria even with elements of village building with NPC helpers too with a sprinkle of RimWorld even.</p>
<p>The indie developer Fair Games ApS expanded and pulled in two new artists, and this work has been in progress for at least a year so it's great to see it finally arrive.</p>
<p>Check out how it will look in the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K_egmB6i9zc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ccb7458b70933dc2db0ce8f3ca4922e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K_egmB6i9zc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>That actually looks a huge amount better.</em></p>
<p>The developer actually announced late last year that it had sold over a million copies, so no doubt this will help pull in even more players new to the world. </p>
<p>Necesse has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy it from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Horticular is a beautifully relaxing garden-restoring game inspired by Viva Pinata</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired in parts by both Viva Pinata and Rollercoaster Tycoon, inDirection Games and Slug Disco just released Horticular and it's as sweet as they come. <em>Note: key provided by publisher.</em></p>
<p>For cozy game fans, this is absolutely the one for you. Especially if you're a bit of a green finger. I myself am not, I kill every plant that's ever given to me, but at least now I can do it total safety and not have to feel bad about killing yet another cactus.</p>
<p>Here you've been magically summoned by mysterious gnomes to restore a long-lost garden. In some ways, it actually reminds me of Terra Nil, which is about restoring a wasteland but here it's gardening. Similar idea, very different in design overall though. If you enjoyed Terra Nil, I think you would enjoy this a bit too. Less of a puzzle game though, more of a sandbox to beautify the land.</p>

<p>Horticular is all about taking your time, and just making everything look sweet. It has a day / night cycle, and a weather system too. You can't even speed things up during the day, so you can just sit back and make the most of it. You do have a real sense of purpose here though, it's not just idle building. As you progress you unlock more and more, eventually you can get some animals to arrive if you ensure they have everything they need.</p>
<p>Even if you're not particularly creative, there's plenty there to keep you going through the quests and challenges where the progress nicely drip-feeds more into the game for you. Especially with the gold and upgrade system, you can go for hours and hours at a time. And for those who are creative, the sandbox mode is for you where you don't have to follow the story along.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support that worked without issues and well worth a purchase if you love more casual games. Really does allow you to just zone-out and get fixing up the place.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928540/Horticular/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Huge factory sim Shapez 2 releases on August 15 with over 300k wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>It's almost time to get cutting some shapes, with the Early Access release of Shapez 2 coming on August 15. Their press team mentioned the developer has managed to build up over 300,000 wishlists, so at this point it's pretty much guaranteed to be a success early on.</p>

      <title>The new detachable JSAUX Dock will fit a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X, Legion Go and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have to hand it to JSAUX, they have something for everything at this point. And they just launched their new 6-in-1 JSAUX Dock that can be pulled apart. Compatible with the Steam Deck, ROG Ally / Ally X, Legion Go and no doubt many others if they all fit.</p>
<p>If you're somehow still in the market for a handheld device dock, despite them being everywhere and JSAUX having 1…2…6 etc models, here's <em>another</em> choice for you with the "6-in-1 Multifunctional Docking Station".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the inputs it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>1* USB-C port for connecting to the handheld device.</li>
<li>1* USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).</li>
<li>2* USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps).</li>
<li>1* Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps).</li>
<li>1* HDMI (4K@120Hz).</li>
<li>1* USB-C (PD 100W input).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16174789061721829190gol1.png"/></p>
<p>At $45.99 it seems like a really good deal for what you get, a decent amount of ports and looks pretty nice.</p>
<p>The unique point about this one? The hub part that takes all the inputs can be pulled out of the base of the dock. So it's quite portable overall. Makes me think perhaps they <em>might</em> eventually sell upgrades for the actual input hub part of the dock, to just slot it into the base. At that price though, they will probably just make a whole new one.</p>

      <title>In Hollow Survivors: Prologue you play as one of the few remaining sane Hollows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Survivors: Prologue is out today, giving us a slice of what to expect from this rogue-lite dungeon crawler where you play as one of the few remaining sane Hollows. Since it's a Prologue, it's more like a standalone demo but it seems to be worth a look and offers Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>While you may be thinking, oh no, <em>another</em> survivor-like but not quite. While it certainly has <em>some</em> elements popularised by Vampire Survivors, that it seems like half of the indie world is copying, like picking random upgrades it's a lot more than that. This is a seriously stylish and atmospheric dungeon crawler. Well, more like a tower crawler in this case with you climbing stairs after each area is defeated to ascend ever higher.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G1l5ZOliaFk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/38189b9153736fd217ce1cf099bd8468.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G1l5ZOliaFk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been playing it through and think it's a delight. Some great action, and the character builds you can make are really interesting. What makes it quite fun is that you only have three main abilities: your main weapon, a magical blast and to quick-dodge. But when you level up, you pick from a set of randomized abilities to power each of them up. So when you dodge you might hit enemies with lightning, or your magical blast might additionally add another hit to enemies after a short countdown and so on.</p>
<p>The style of it is just fantastic overall, really worth a go.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909680/Hollow_Survivors_Prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for ColdRidge a Wild West turn-based exploration game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, <strong>ColdRidge</strong> is a cowboy themed Wild West turn-based exploration game that looks really worth your time. Coming from the Paris-based team at Frog Collective, this is their first game.</p>
<p>Step into the rugged boots of a prospector and venture into the untamed wilderness of Coldridge, a land shrouded in mystery and plagued by a sinister curse. Your mission: uncover precious resources, tackle intricate puzzles, and strategically manage contracts to maximize your gains. Unveil the enigmatic secrets of the guild and their grip on Coldridge in this captivating adventure.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lTXoQQIVk4o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3818ff92a235b05f3cc620e41a857300.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lTXoQQIVk4o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Currently the demo only notes a Windows icon, but there is a full Native Linux demo available.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>EXPLORE THE UNTAMED WILDERNESS - Traverse the uncharted territories of Coldridge, mapping out resources for the all-powerful guild. Each step into the wild presents new challenges and opportunities as you navigate through the treacherous landscapes.</li>
<li>HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD - Carefully plan your expeditions by choosing the right contracts. Will you play it safe with calculated risks, or will you dare to gamble for potentially greater rewards? The choices you make could lead to fortune or peril.</li>
<li>MASTER MOVEMENT PLANNING - Fulfill your contracts by meticulously planning your moves. Utilize the terrain and your equipment to gain an edge, outmaneuver obstacles, and complete your objectives efficiently.</li>
<li>UNLOCK NEW CHARACTERS - Experience rogue-lite progression as you unlock new characters and objects. Each playthrough offers fresh challenges and opportunities. See how long you can survive and how deep you can delve into the secrets of Coldridge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing out the demo, it definitely gives off some vibes from the early exploration stage in the Civilization series and other similar games. A lot more compact than that though, a lot more focused on the individual and your little quests.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. It should release sometime late this year.</p>

      <title>Humble Games confirmed a &#39;restructuring of operations&#39; with reports of all staff gone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tough times for indies, as Humble Games have confirmed they've done a "restructuring" of the publisher with previous staff saying <em>everyone</em> has been let go. This does not affect Humble Bundle / Humble Store though, as they were separate.</p>
<p>Reports coming in from yesterday with various ex-staffers posting on LinkedIn, like Emilee Kieffer, who was a Senior QA at Humble Games in a post that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games" and they also <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (Twitter) that the "entirety of Humble Games was laid off this morning". Another is Nicola Kwan who was a BizDev at Humble Games, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on LinkedIn as well noting that "At 9AM this morning, all 36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down.".</p>
<p>Eventually, Humble Games posted a <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (Twitter) that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle.</p>
<p>We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p>
<p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The website <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aftermath</a> managed to obtain a recording of a meeting where everyone was let go, and they were told that a third-party named The Powell Group will be finishing up any remaining projects.</p>
<p>Chris Radley, former Creative Lead at Humble Games (but left in 2022) didn't hold back on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a> mentioning no staff are left:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want it to be made abundantly clear, this is NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of #HumbleGames. Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left.<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT believe this AI message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was ONCE AGAIN a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative and its so disrespectful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting Humble Games (and Humble Bundle) are owned by IGN's parent company, Ziff Davis, who also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ign-acquired-the-gamer-network-including-rps-eurogamer-vg247-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently acquired Gamer Network</a> including RPS, Eurogamer, VG247 and more and then fired a bunch of staff too.</p>

      <title>Kitsune Tails will be a platformer to remember, full of mini-games and powerful modding tools</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitsune Tails, the platformer styled after beloved classics and steeped in Japanese mythology, shows off a bunch of retro minigames and some pretty powerful modding support that will be available at launch.</p>
<p>Coming with full Native Linux and Steam Deck support, I think this is going to be one to remember. Kitsune Games, who previously made games including MidBoss and Ultra Hat Dimension are crafting something pretty ridiculous here.</p>
<p>The new trailer that went up today shows off the power of their hand-made game engine with all the platforming you could want. However, to spice it up the mini-games are a whole lot of something else including Haunted Heist, a first-person maze-crawling experience inspired by early FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D with the chase-and-escape tactics of Pac-Man. There's even games like Boulder Dash and Arkanoid. What more could you want in a retro-styled game?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0EQkhejCoRs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25ee303d051475f9f40a45a7864e19bb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0EQkhejCoRs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If that wasn't enough there's also simple to use modding tools to make your own levels and mini-games with Lua, along with the open source Tiled Map Editor. So, in a way, this is a platformer with a whole fantasy console included.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic platforming action set in a land inspired by Japanese mythology.</li>
<li>Explore five elemental worlds and various haunted houses.</li>
<li>Learn new elemental powers and use them to find secrets and optional story content.</li>

      <title>Apple design award winner Afterplace just released on PC with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally a mobile game that won an Apple design award, Afterplace is an open world adventurous retro game for those who like to get lost. Today it released on PC with full Native Linux support. Always nice to see a popular mobile game make its way onto more platforms!</p>
<p>More about it from the developer: Afterplace is an adventurous retro game for those who like to get lost. It's a huge open world, full of hidden secrets, treasures, and creatures. You'll run around the woods, fight monsters, and talk to ostensibly shady characters! All from the comfort of your couch (or toilet)! You never know what the forest might be hiding, and not all trails are paved. Labyrinths and dungeons are tucked away in the most concealed nooks. There are no waypoints in Afterplace. You'll have to forge your own path.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LCQN5LDPvKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/235cd480c2c49f3087a39683b4b89680.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LCQN5LDPvKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned: "It should run on any Linux distro that supports OpenGL and can run a C++ executable, and supports all the features of its PC and Mac counterparts!". The feature list they mentioned is also somewhat amusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>About 10 hours of unique gameplay (and much more if you lose your way)</li>
<li>No overworld map</li>
<li>An open world that lets you explore any path in any order</li>
<li>Tons of friends, enemies, and at least one frenemy</li>
<li>The ability to upgrade weapons, purchase armor, and ingest hazardous chemicals to increase your power</li>
<li>Okay maybe there is an overworld map</li>
<li>Multiple endings, decided by choices you probably don't even know you're making</li>
<li>Like 25 unique enemies? That's a lot, right?</li>
<li>Wait, no, this overworld map is written on a napkin with crayon. That won't do.</li>
<li>Secret paths that will take you to completely normal and fun places</li>
<li>A cat that you can pet. With your sword.</li>
<li>The 25 unique monsters are really special though. They have sparkling personalities, and aren't like other monsters.</li>
<li>At least two overworld maps.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bit confusing, but the funny kind and now it makes me want to play it so — job done I guess?</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>Deep space colony sim Stardeus gets a massive overhaul in a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Get ready to put together a spaceship again, as the deep space colony sim Stardeus has a really massive update out now and it's looking great. Basically, it's RimWorld on a spaceship and it's cool.</p>
<p>From developer Kodo Linija and publisher Paradox Arc (Paradox Interactive), it's a game that's easy to lose not just hours in but days at a time. Set aboard a damaged starship, crewed by drones and hibernating human survivors as the game's immortal AI, you'll command drones to repair the starship, make critical decisions about the human crew, and explore a procedurally generated universe filled with complexity.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This big new update, named Bioverse, is the biggest since it entered Early Access back in 2022 adding in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revamped AI system</li>
<li>Enhanced combat mechanics</li>
<li>Innovative body part system, including new health, stats, conditions, and abilities system</li>
<li>New content: Additional scenario, new devices, materials, species and more</li>
<li>New trade system</li>
<li>Twitch Integration</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-zwHOfoZ_Kg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e9e2b574aea80e56602fa03fb2e64f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-zwHOfoZ_Kg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has full Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>Well worth looking into. Had a blast playing it pre-release when doing Steam Deck checks with the developer, and it's grown a lot since then. It has a Very Positive rating on Steam too from over a thousand players.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/stardeus?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 560 Linux driver Beta has Wayland improvements, defaults to open GPU kernel modules</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released a fresh Beta to get you testing all the latest features and fixes. So here's what's new in the NVIDIA 560.28.03 driver Beta for Linux.</p>
<p>As NVIDIA said recently, this is the first release that will use the open GPU kernel modules by default, as long as your GPU supports this. Which is an exciting step for more open source on your system. Plus various Wayland improvements, VRR for notebooks with the open GPU kernel modules and various bug fixes.</p>
<p>From the changelog here's the new additions and major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to select the NVIDIA open GPU kernel modules by default on systems with GPUs that support both the proprietary and open kernel modules.</li>
<li>Added support for EGL_KHR_platform_x11 and EGL_EXT_platform_xcb on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added a PipeWire backend to NvFBC that allows it to work on the Wayland compositors that support screencasting via XDG Desktop Portal. This new interface will be available through an upcoming Capture SDK release.</li>
<li>Added support for multiple concurrent clients to NvFBC direct capture.</li>
<li>Added reporting of Vulkan information to nvidia-settings control panel.</li>
<li>Compiling nvidia-settings from source now requires Vulkan header files to be available.</li>
<li>Support DRM-KMS explicit synchronization via the IN_FENCE_FD mode setting property.</li>
<li>Support VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) for Wayland on pre-Volta GPUs.</li>
<li>Added support for Variable Refresh Rate on notebooks with the open kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated glXWaitVideoSyncSGI() to be more efficient. This reduces frame stutter in some KDE configurations with GSP offload.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the various bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused GPU driver installation to fail when the system used alternate implementations of the 'tr' utility, such as from the busybox or toybox projects.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the wrong image format to be used for render pass image clears in Vulkan applications when using a VkImage created with VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT. This could lead to rendering corruption, as described in issues such as:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3961" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3961</a></li>
<li>Fixed multiple issues that could cause crashes or unexpected behaviors when re-creating an NvFBC capture session.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some displays to appear multiple times in the nvidia-settings display layout configuration page on systems with multiple GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL triple buffering to behave like double buffering.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>DRAG returns as ExoCross, an offroad racing game with 4CPT vehicle physics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember DRAG from Orontes Games? A while back in 2021 they were <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/orontes-games-creator-of-drag-gets-acquired-by-iracing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired by iRacing</a> and now the game has returned finished as the future off-road racing sim ExoCross. It has full Native Linux support still, which appears in great shape.</p>
<p>All players that purchased it when it was DRAG: Outer Zones automatically get ExoCross, as it just replaces the Early Access game. This was one of the most promising and exciting racing games I had played in a long time back in 2020, so it's great to see it finally out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3oVcr9wChAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfe51c4531489e7c04675361eeee0763.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3oVcr9wChAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “We’re thrilled to finally be able to unveil the completed version of ExoCross to the world,” said iRacing president Tony Gardner. “ExoCross represents a bold and unique racing vision for us: a world built around exhilarating off-road racing with cars unlike anything our fans have ever seen. Our team has poured tons of hard work into ExoCross, and we hope everybody enjoys it as much as we do!”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>4CPT physics: </strong>Fully simulated chassis and suspension components and a soft-body tire model create realistic weight transfer and understeer/oversteer.</li>
<li><strong>Slipstream and boosts: </strong>Put the power down in the right places to charge past your opponents, or slot in behind them to recharge your boost as quickly as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Three unique cars: </strong>Take the wheel of three distinct cars, each more challenging and powerful than the last.</li>
<li><strong>Dozens of circuits:</strong> Do battle on 19 distinct track layouts—each raceable in both directions—across four unique biomes.</li>
<li><strong>AI Racing and Championship Mode: </strong>Advance through six racing series, two per car, to establish yourself as the top driver in ExoCross, going into battle with challenging AI opponents in up to 10-race seasons. Just want to pick up and play? Pick any car and track combo you want and hit the track!</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Mode: </strong>Take on 48 unique challenges across all four zones and showcase your top speed against a global leaderboard.</li>
<li><strong>Online racing: </strong>Face off with global players in a mix of Challenges and circuit races, with player votes determining every car and track selection. When the community decides, will you have the skills to make the best of the rounds ahead?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The release has been a bit on the <em>quiet</em> side, with no Steam announcement even posted yet to announce the finished game has been released. Trying to play online just results in endless matchmaking too, since the player-count is currently low, which will <em>hopefully</em> tick up when more people realise ExoCross is actually out. Although, it's quite disappointing to <em>only</em> see matchmaking and no lobby support to easily just hook up with friends.</p>

<em>Pictured: ExoCross - captured on Linux</em></p>
<p>Aside from the above, ExoCross is a lot of fun and quite a <em>challenging</em> racer with the physics system. I do a fair amount of spinning off the tracks still, bringing back memories of playing the earlier versions when it was called DRAG. A well built racer with a nice mixture of tracks and the AI is pretty good to race against with a firm enough challenge to make it interesting.</p>
<p>I've been blasting through it attempting to get through the Championship Mode today, and it's thoroughly entertaining. Gliding around corners, wheel-to-wheel with AI as you smash the boost button to fly ahead. It feels really good to drive the vehicles in this.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/773840/ExoCross/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 46 brings major upgrades and enhanced handheld support for GPD, AYANEO, OneXPlayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimeraOS Linux 46 has released today and there's a whole lot of improvements for this handheld and couch-gaming focused Linux distro.</p>
<p>For starters, they have a whole new input system they call InputPlumber, which they say is an "open source input routing and control daemon for Linux written in Rust" that "can be used to combine any number of input devices (like gamepads, mice, gyros, and keyboards) and translate their input to a variety of virtual device formats". So basically, it's like a fully open Steam Input and they've integrated it into OpenGamepadUI.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12326303231721741990gol1.png"/></p>
<p>They've also introduced Emulation Content Sharing, allowing a single ChimeraOS device to act as a host for ROM files and related artwork. Additionally this release brings Remote Launch, that lets you launch any game, including Steam, GOG, Epic, and Emulated games via a URL. On top of that they also hooked up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/gb-operator-is-a-fun-gadget-for-game-boy-fans-tested-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GB Operator</a> support so it's plug and play.</p>
<p>Lots of other fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ayaneo-platform driver brightness scaling has been fixed, response time from the driver has been improved by 20x, and there is now a "suspend_mode" attribute that can be used to control the LED's behavior during sleep. Suspend mode is not currently available on the AIR Plus variants. See the <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/ayaneo-platform?tab=readme-ov-file#changing-startup-defaults" rel="noopener" target="_blank">readme</a> for guidance on how best to set your preferred settings.</li>
<li>ayn-platform is now compatible with HHFC for multi-temperature based fan curves.</li>
<li>Added AW87xxx driver. Audio will now work properly on the AYANEO AIR 1S, AYANEO Flip, and AYN Loki Mini Pro.</li>
<li>Fan control is now enabled for the following devices: GPD Win Mini. AYANEO 2S, AIR 1S, GEEK 1S,and KUN. OneXPlayer 2 and OneXFly. OrangePi NEO.</li>
<li>Replaced BMI160 and BMI260 DKMS drivers with kernel patches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added full support for the OrangePi NEO.</li>
<li>Added partial support to the AYANEO Flip models. Touchscreen support is still in progress.</li>
<li>Gyroscope input can now be used on most handheld devices using the DS5 Edge Target Device in InputPlumber.</li>
<li>The Steam frame limit slider will now properly function for many handheld systems.</li>
<li>Enabled the built-in TDP control for the Steam Deck. Desktop GPU's can also be adjusted with this slider for undervolting.</li>
<li>Added TDP control support for the AMD 8000 series into PowerStation.</li>
<li>Reduced the default resolution on many handhelds to improve performance. This can be overwritten with <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/gamescope-session?tab=readme-ov-file#user-configuration" rel="noopener" target="_blank">environment variables</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GOG now always downloads the Windows version for new game installs</li>
<li>GOG and Epic now default to Proton 8 for new game installs</li>
<li>Included multiple fixes for gamescope and gamescope-session up-streamed from our friends over at BazziteOS. Additionally, gamescope-session has been refactored to be more flexible.</li>
<li>Formatting or adding Steam libraries to removable media and additional internal drives can now be managed through OpenGamepadUI. The Chimera app interface is still enabled for this as well.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where wireplumber configurations could break first boot after installing or an update.</li>
<li>Chimera splash screen will show a message with current step instead of a generic "Downloading game configuration updates".</li>
<li>Implemented hiding and customizing the splash screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a suspend issue on some GPD devices caused by the fingerprint scanner.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a fix for MT7921e WiFi devices would cause MT7922 WiFi devices to fail. (Legion Go, ROG Ally)</li>
<li>Removed lib32 gamescope, which caused issues with HDR enabled displays and WSI.</li>
<li>Fixed Chimera password screen not appearing in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fixed custom Proton and configurations not being applied correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with shortcut artwork assets not updating.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Codename: Ocean Keeper takes Dome Keeper and puts you in an underwater twin-stick mech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Take the mining and defense idea from Dome Keeper, stick you in an underwater mech with exploration and twin-stick shooting and you've got Codename: Ocean Keeper. <em>Note: key sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Available in Early Access with Native Linux support, it is an interesting idea, and one I'm keen to see evolve during the planned few months it will remain there before being fully released.</p>
<p>Here you explore the bottom of the ocean in a robotic spider-mech, one which you can customize with various different types of weapons and upgrades as you go. It's a wave-based twin-stick shooter, although your wipes can fire automatically, you can also fire the main weapon manually in a focused-fire mode. The battles range from small mites running at you, to bigger boss battles.</p>

<p>On top of the battling and exploring, you also have the cave-dwelling, which is really where the Dome Keeper-like feeling sets in. You jump down into a cave and get drilling for different riches, and occasionally a special artifact to get some extra upgrade. Unlike Dome Keeper though, you're not limited to the one area to drill. You drill through one, grab the goodies, and then get back in your mech to go explore somewhere else.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the ocean floor and remnants of civilization on a huge robotic spider.</li>
<li>Find deep caves and drill tunnels in search of valuable resources and artifacts.</li>
<li>Upgrade mechanisms to survive in this aggressive environment as long as possible.</li>
<li>Fight hordes of sea monsters under the energy dome, using a huge arsenal of weapons</li>
<li>Earn meta-currency for complete customization of your robotic spider.</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial EA release had some issues, like the right stick for aiming not actually working on Linux / Steam Deck, but they very quickly solved that. Now it appears to run without issues!</p>
<p>It's a good start from what I've played, and clearly its hitting the mark for a few with it getting a Very Positive rating on Steam, but my initial feeling is that it's just a bit too slow until you can get a decent bunch of upgrades going. A lot of games start of slow, which is fine, but here it all feels a bit too <em>sluggish</em>. They need to spice up the intro a fair bit I think because it's too plain. Once you do get going though, and have a few runs for the meta upgrades, it does get at least more interesting.</p>

      <title>Party-based soulslike Deathbound aims to be Steam Deck Verified at release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trialforge Studio and Tate Multimedia are bringing their party-based soulslike set in a harsh world where Faith clashes with Science to Steam on August 8th and it should be good to go for Steam Deck players. Which is good news for desktop Linux players too since both will use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> so it should work great.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with an online party here, instead you gain the skills and identities of fallen warriors found throughout the world. This gives you the option to seamlessly switch between all of them while you craft a play-style through the talent trees available. Sounds pretty fun!</p>
<p>Friday last week the developers posted an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1277130/announcements/detail/4334235468138941634" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have good news for all Akratya citizens! Deathbound is playable on Steam Deck, and we aim to receive the Deck Verified status on release day. Right now, all Fallen Warriors can play the Deathbound demo on Steam Deck, and it’s fully compatible with Valve’s handheld device.</p>
<p>We tested Deathbound on Steam Deck and were consistently satisfied with the results— the game runs smoothly, and we did not encounter any major bugs on this platform. Similar feedback was received from many members of our community who had the opportunity to play Deathbound on this device.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are aiming for Deathbound to receive Verified Game status on Steam Deck on the release date, which is scheduled for August 8th.</p>

      <title>Immersive idle RPG &#39;Bloobs Adventure&#39; recently got lots of Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bloobs Adventure is an idle game with a difference, bringing together adventuring and RPG styled mechanics into a more casual game. Idle games don't often have you do all that much, which is why Bloobs Adventure is a little bit more interesting with a whole world to explore.</p>
<p>More about it: "Watch on as you command your Bloob to seamlessly navigate his way around a sprawling, ever-expanding world automatically. Choose which skills to train, items to create, and enemies to defeat. Push your and your Bloob's skills farther, and become the most powerful force in the the world. Forge your own path, and your own equipment on your way to conquer every boss that stands in your way. Do it on your time, because after all, Bloob will do the hard work for you."</p>
<p>You can check out the slightly chaotic trailer below:</p>

<p>It launched on Steam on July 15th, and has already gained a Very Positive rating and has hundreds of players checking it out right now. At the end of last week, the developer also put up a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2942780/announcements/detail/6957581711060460996" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big update</a> that fixed up numerous issues with people playing it on Steam Deck. Just some of the improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Developing a Video Game with Unreal Engine 5 on Linux</title>
      <author>Vasilis</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In November 2022, we started a side project in my company, a video game called Cuprum 2929. Because I love Linux (being a full user since 2009) and I'm the owner of the company, I made the bold decision to fully develop it on Linux. While this is largely true, I have to put a disclaimer now that we are not building everything on the Linux OS, but about 95%, which is still impressive in my opinion.</p>
<p>In the article below, I'll discuss in detail our choices, our setup, how we helped some parts of the ecosystem support Linux better, and why some work couldn't be done on Linux. I'm also going to share some tips and tricks that I discovered myself to make the experience better and unlock some features that may not be available on the UE Linux build, and how we get the most out of it.</p>
<h2>Setting up Unreal Engine</h2>
<p>As is the case for a lot of things on a Linux OS, there are multiple ways to do this. If you are committed to developing your video game on Linux, I'm going to suggest the best thing that worked for us so far. If you want to experiment yourself, you can follow the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-quickstart-for-unreal-engine" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>unreal engine guide</u></a>, which would be redundant to repeat here.</p>
<p>After we tried a few ways, the best flow for us (which is going to make more and more sense the more you progress in this article) is to build our own Unreal Engine fork. To get access to the Unreal Engine source code, as described in the previously linked guide, you can also fork it.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Unreal Engine project is huge in size, we only have a copy of the latest commit (git clone --depth=1 ) . But why go to all that effort?</p>
<p>Later on, you'll see that we make changes to the code, build plugins that are not available for Linux in the Unreal Engine store, and we have a synchronised way of all of us using the same engine with the same plugins available.</p>
<p>The process to build UE from source is not different when you have your own fork and it's already provided by Epic Games <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/README.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> .</p>
<h2>Using Third Party Plugins</h2>
<h3>Live Link</h3>
<p>We found ourselves early on experimenting with cutscenes/cinematics in our project. A key part was making character dialogs realistic, so we tried using LiveLink. This was in May 2023, and we found out that a lot of the plugins were not available in the Linux build. After a short dig through the code, we found out that you could try to enable those plugins through some configuration and rebuild the engine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18868024571721650161gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18868024571721650161gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It worked without issues, and all the code was compiling! We also created a proof of concept with a cutscene using Metahumans and Quixel Bridge. Later on, these plugins became available by default on Linux, so now you don't have to change anything.</p>
<p>We then committed the code to our fork and rolled it out to all three of our developers.</p>
<h4>Quixel Bridge</h4>
<p>Quixel Bridge is available when you build UE from source. However, it wasn't available when we used any of the provided pre-made binaries. Now, it seems to be available, but it may not always be for the latest release.</p>
<h3>Smartsuit</h3>
<p>In the winter of 2023, we acquired the Rokoko Smartsuit and gloves. It's a suit with sensors that allows you to create animations quickly by wearing the suit and gloves. We acquired it knowing that Linux was not supported, but we wanted to make it so, just for the fun of it (and because I may have anger management issues when they tell me something doesn't work on Linux, but just maybe!).</p>
<p>The first issue was that Rokoko Studio, the software that you interface with to use the suit and create animations, despite working with Wine, wouldn't recognize the hardware for the initial pairing (connected via USB). I spent 3-4 days tinkering with the Wine source code, but it seemed it needed a lot of work.</p>
<p>Luckily, we had acquired a Mac because of the needs of another project, where a certain video game educational studio would not work consistently on Linux. We then did the initial pairing through the Macbook (the rest of the connection works wirelessly). So how it worked is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the suit and gloves connected through the USB (one by one).</li>
<li>Set the IP of the Studio to be on the Linux machine (running under Wine).</li>
<li>Have a static LAN IP for the Linux machine so you won't have to repeat this pairing all the time.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>All of the other features of Rokoko Studio work flawlessly on Linux.</p>
<p>We then found ourselves with another problem. The Rokoko Smartsuit plugin was not available for Linux. We <a href="https://github.com/Rokoko/rokoko-studio-live-unreal-engine/pull/55" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>provided a PR</u></a> that was kindly merged, with all the changes needed to make it buildable and usable on Linux (along with some bug fixes). Since then, our integration works flawlessly.</p>
<h2>Cross Platform Collaboration</h2>
<p>Since building a video game is a task that involves multiple disciplines and managing often short-term needs (like doing some technical animation or some special programming), we need the services of short-term contractors. We thus cannot expect every contractor to use the same setup as we do.</p>
<p>To collaborate, we need to ensure that we are using the same release version of Unreal Engine (to the patch level). It then doesn't matter if ours has some extra changes that do not affect the core of it.</p>
<p>When you open a project that was done on a different platform, you'll get a message to convert or skip conversion. Convert in place works (<strong>please have a version control system in place before you do that</strong>).</p>
<h3>Version control system (VCS)</h3>
<p>We use Git for VCS, with LFS. Basically, all the files apart from any C++ source files and configs go to Git LFS. That includes textures, sounds, maps, blueprints, and literally everything that's not a text file. We identified very early on that using Git LFS would be a problem. We used GitLab, which provides an LFS backend with a 10GB limit, and we had to do a lot of careful work to not exceed that limit.</p>
<p>As the work progressed, we needed to find another solution. One of our engineers took the initiative to create a setup that would be cheap and easy to use, while still using GitLab. His work is summarized in <a href="https://www.vaslabs.io/post/migrating-from-gitlab-lfs-to-s3-to-save-money" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>this article</u></a>, and we <a href="https://github.com/vaslabs-ltd/git-s3-lfs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>open-sourced a Terraform module</u></a> that helps with the setup.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not a Linux-specific problem, but I'd like to emphasize how committed we are to helping both ourselves and the community. The setup with S3 costs us about 0.20 EUR per month, effectively nothing.</p>
<h2>Building Projects from Source</h2>
<p>It's come to our attention that writing C++ is somewhat problematic. Now, I'm not 100% sure if this is due to our setup or not. Basically, it seems that the generated Makefile is missing a few targets to be operational. I'm going to describe how we are fixing that, using a starter project called Lyra, which is available through the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/Z4/lyra-starter-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Epic Games store</u></a>. Note that the most efficient way we found to download content from the store on Linux is the <a href="https://github.com/AchetaGames/Epic-Asset-Manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Epic Asset Manager</u></a>.</p>
<p>When you download and open the project, you are going to get a version warning; you can select convert in place. Then, in our case, there is an error that the source code cannot be compiled.</p>
<p>If you open your terminal and run make, you'll get an error that some targets are missing. This is an issue we have when we are working on other video games as well. The way we fix it for now is with trial and error, using the Makefile from Unreal Engine as a guide. We are planning, though, to find the root cause and, if necessary, send a PR to get it fixed.</p>
<h2>Our progress</h2>
<p>Finally, I want to share our progress to give you an idea of the ecosystem state for developing a video game on Linux as well. So far, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation menus, sound effects, and visual effects (using Niagara)</li>
<li>Imported customized Metahumans, with all the features working</li>
<li>Short cutscenes, animated from the Smartsuit and edited inside Unreal Engine</li>
<li>A rich collection of 3D assets, created in Blender3D and imported successfully into our project</li>
<li>AI behavior for some of our levels</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow our progress on our <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2660240/CUPRUM2929/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Steam Page</u></a>. As I am writing this, we are also creating a Discord server; unfortunately, it is not ready yet to make public. Look for us in Steam October Fest, where we'll be releasing a demo and broadcasting our gameplay!</p>

      <title>Open-ended physics building-puzzler Captain Contraption&#39;s Chocolate Factory is out now with a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build various contraptions in an almost Zachtronics-like automation puzzle game, Captain Contraption's Chocolate Factory is quite reasonably priced and is available now with a demo you can try too. It has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>It's an open-ended puzzle game where you get to design and build your own Rube Goldberg styled crazy machines to combine ingredients to make <em>chocolates</em>. Automate your production using simple components to create ingenious contraptions, which are as satisfying to watch as they are to optimise. Once it gets going, and you see all the moving parts, it is quite something. A little Opus Magnum and World of Goo combined perhaps.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CkYecZ_V3Uo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/543cf9a4375d34129108e5c6a93b6956.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CkYecZ_V3Uo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It even includes an easy to use level editor, the same they use to build the game so you can create your own challenges. With Steam Workshop support, you can put your creations online and play those of others too. They even have leaderboards to compete against others on them too.</p>
<p>For £8.50 you can't really go wrong with it if you like designing machines and automation.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2166920/Captain_Contraptions_Chocolate_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://pillbuginteractive.itch.io/captain-contraptions-chocolate-factory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included: The Frosty Planet Pack is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included has a new expansion out with The Frosty Planet Pack, which seems like a chill way to blow through another few hundred hours. Perhaps not quite as big as the Spaced Out! expansion, but still sounds like a lot of good stuff has been added into the game to give you some new ways to play it.</p>
<p>Great to see Klei Entertainment still updating one of my favourites. I'm going to have to stay away, or I really won't get anything done. Anyway, here's the highlights of what you get with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brand-new icy starting world.</li>
<li>New critters: Flouncy Floxes! Behemoth Bammoths! Sweet-toothed Spigot Seals!</li>
<li>Three new biomes: Ice Cave, Cool Pool and Nectar.</li>
<li>New plants: Pikeapple Bush, Alveo Vera, Sherberry Plant, Plume Squash, Bonbon Tree, and Idylla Flower.</li>
<li>New buildings: Wood Heater, Snow Tile, Deep Fryer, and more!</li>
<li>New elements: Cinnabar, Tallow, and Nectar.</li>
<li>New Duplicant: meet Freyja!</li>
<li>New POIs: a Gravitas live/work showroom! An enlightening Research Portal! A power plant that may or may not have wreaked havoc on past colonies!</li>
<li>Exclusive, cold-themed new blueprints collection!</li>
<li>Revised temperature mechanics.</li>
<li>...and more!</li>
<li>The universe can be a cold, cold place...conquer it all from the questionable comfort of your cool new snow fort colony in The Frosty Planet Pack DLC!</li>
</ul>

      <title>FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage now Steam Deck Verified with Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZOOM Platform put out a major update for FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage with all three now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Ultimate Carnage was actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/flatout-ultimate-carnage-updated-with-steam-deck-support-and-no-more-drm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deck Verified earlier this year</a>, so that status is <em>new</em> for FlatOut 1 and 2. In addition, <em>all three</em> of them now have Steam Workshop support along with Steam trading cards, backgrounds, emojis, and badges too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16977109161721643357gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16977109161721643357gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage Collector's Edition</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">FlatOut 1 and 2 got the biggest updates. FlatOut 1 received:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Cloud support.</li>
<li>Added widescreen support. (Up to 21:9)</li>
<li>Added Czech, Russian, Hungarian and Polish languages.</li>
<li>Fixed texture issues with Blocker and Pepper cars.</li>
<li>Higher quality music tracks.</li>
<li>Improved model pop-in.</li>
<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">While FlatOut 2 also got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Czech, Russian, Hungarian and Polish languages.</li>
<li>Added Steam Cloud support.</li>
<li>Added Steam rich presence.</li>
<li>Restored unused track: "Papa Roach - Blood Brothers"</li>
<li>Improved model pop-in.</li>
<li>Improved FOV set by the game.</li>
<li>Improved aspect ratio for widescreen monitors.</li>
<li>Increased Lua memory limit.</li>
<li>Increased buffer size.</li>
<li>Enabled multiplayer hosted by OpenSpy.net.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimate Carnage also fixed some Czech letters not showing up.</p>
<p>On top of that, work is ongoing to get FlatOut 3 to work properly, although the game overall was really not well received (Overwhelmingly Negative on Steam). Zoom Platform mentioned to me via email they've done a minor change to get it to actually launch with Steam's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> now, they're "just waiting for Steam to merge in disabling esync and fsync in Proton for that to work". But for now you can set a launch option for it to work:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 %command%</code></p>

      <title>Acre Crisis looks like a fun throwback to the original Dino Crisis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Directly inspired by the visual style of classic PlayStation 1 (PS1) games, Acre Crisis has a lot of clear Dino Crisis vibes and it's out now. It comes with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>A first-person shooter with a survival horror theme that features a story mode, arcade mode and there's even both co-op and competitive multiplayer.</p>
<p>About it: "In 1992, following a series of mysterious deaths caused by wild animals, as well as strange sightings of cryptids in the sparsely populated and underdeveloped Amazon region of Acre, a special operations brigade from the Brazilian Military Police was sent to the area to gather intelligence. However, the situation took an unexpected turn for the soldiers, who soon found themselves cornered in the midst of a jungle infested with hungry dinosaurs."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-DMJpAuabhU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fea9d8fee24c8841da8273a089b67ada.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-DMJpAuabhU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short Length: The story mode can be completed in 1-3 hours, depending on the player's skill.</li>
<li>Replayability: The game features an Arcade mode where quick survival matches can be played.</li>
<li>Multiplayer: The game features a Multiplayer mode where you can participate in competitive or cooperative matches with your friends or face off against different people around the world.</li>
<li>Point System: While playing solo, you can collect points that you can later redeem for better weapons or cosmetics for your character.</li>
<li>Atmospheric: Explore the Amazon jungle with a wide variety of visual and sound effects, weather, and a day-night system that will completely immerse you in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think younger me would have absolutely jumped at the chance to play something like this, having fond memories of similar games.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932900/Acre_Crisis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux 3.6 out now bringing full ASUS ROG Ally X support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the "next generation of Linux gaming" has a new release out with Bazzite 3.6 bringing support for the new ASUS ROG Ally X handheld.</p>
<p>Getting support in even before it's officially released, which is really nice to see. The ROG Ally X is due out on July 22nd. As the developers said: "Patches and kernel arguments have been added to make sure the ASUS ROG Ally X is supported before its even sold to most consumers. This update also brings fixes and new features for the original ASUS ROG Ally hardware as well making this update dedicated to the Ally and other handheld PCs. Notable fixes to RGB, calibration for controller deadzones, and better default controller endstops."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12992369621721386761gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So how did they get support in like this? Well, you can thank YouTuber Fan The Deck for it (<a href="https://x.com/kylegospo/status/1813660409536336076" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a>), who had access early and decided to get testing and reporting for the Bazzite team so they could get everything ready.</p>
<p>Other improvements also come with Bazzite 3.6 including ASUS ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go get their audio enhanced, so now it should be closer to Windows. The Legion Go also now has accurate colours in Desktop Mode to match up with the type of screen it uses along with adaptive brightness support.</p>
<p>Also Handheld Daemon saw a <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/releases/tag/v3.2.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new release</a>, which was pulled into Bazzite.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 delayed until October 22 - Playtest coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While I'm a little sad to wait a bit longer, I know the delay for Streets of Rogue 2 is going to be worth it. Originally planned to hit Early Access in August, the release date has now been moved to October 22.</p>
<p>A reminder on what it is: Streets of Rogue 2 is a crazy, immersive RPG sandbox set in a vast randomly generated open world where freedom and fun are dialed up to 11. Fight, sneak, hack, farm, build, steal, or talk your way to power as you try to topple a corrupt president in countless possible ways – solo or with friends.</p>
<p>Even though it's delayed, thankfully though, we're still going to get a look into what to expect sometime soon as there's going to be a Playtest on Steam that anyone can join in on. Speaking about the delay, developer Matt Dabrowski <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2165810/view/6233628070476600070" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While SoR 2 has had a few more folks working on it than its predecessor, I’m still the sole programmer/designer of this thing. Compared with other disciplines, programmers are notoriously bad at predicting how long a given task will take. Now replace “task” with “entire Early Access-ready game,” and as you can probably imagine, guesstimating correctly gets a tad trickier. I’d been targeting a summer launch for a while, which has led to a pretty intense 2024. And while the original release date would have been technically achievable, it would have also been tighter than I was comfortable with. The new date allows me some breathing room and the opportunity to make the game that much better.</p>
<p>The new release date will also give me time to conduct a large-scale Pre-Release Playtest. If Streets of Rogue’s history tells me anything, this should benefit development. Before the original SoR went into Early Access, I released a bunch of builds of the game for free. This was super useful for getting player feedback and paved the way for a smooth launch on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. If you're logged in, you can add yourself to the Playtest requests which should happen sometime late August or early September.</p>

      <title>1047 Games announced Splitgate 2 for release in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>1047 Games have now revealed Splitgate 2, an upcoming free to play shooter building on the basics of the original.</p>
<p>This time around it's coming with a three faction system that they said gives you the ability to choose and progress based on your preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies. There will be a large variety of arenas, weapons and modes keep things fresh and play alone or with friends.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8zPMku7q9hU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b353331591734af3f07c19d33d77ed58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8zPMku7q9hU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The original Splitgate’s development was ambitious but scrappy; the game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams,” said Ian Proulx, co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games. “This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry. This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters. It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community."</p>
<p>Hopefully there will be some kind of Linux and Steam Deck support. The first game was a lot of fun, felt like classic Halo but with portals.</p>
<p>You can give it a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a Summer Event Update, new comic on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated the free to play Team Fortress 2, with a new Summer Event that runs through September 15th, 2024.</p>
<p>Not only that though, there's finally going to be a new comic. As confirmed by Erik Wolpaw on Twitter/X that <a href="https://x.com/Wolpaw/status/1811057658004222125" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "Jay and I are done with script (my proof: last page)(note: 184 script pages != 184 comic pages). If me and Pinkerton die in a writing accident, comic still comes out. If Heather and Maren die, though, you're screwed. Pray for them. 3 variant covers!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1035631221721380727gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>We've also seen recently that Valve has been a bit more active on dealing with the bots too, which briefly saw the TF2 player counts (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/440/charts/#3m" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) shoot up earlier in July although it has stabilised again now, the Summer Event has caused another little bump in more players. Valve even put up a new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/37C7-829B-5DE3-CC3B" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support page</a> that's real firm about TF2 bots and cheaters noting that "Team Fortress 2 game bans are permanent, non-negotiable, and are not removed by Steam Support".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Summer Event includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring 10 new community maps: Embargo, Odyssey, Megaton, Cachoeira, Overgrown, Hadal, Applejack, Atom Smash, Canaveral, and Burghausen</li>
<li>Added the Summer 2024 Cosmetic Case
<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 4 new community-contributed taunts to the Mann Co. Store
<ul>
<li>Taunt: Can It!</li>
<li>Taunt: Cremator's Condolences</li>
<li>Taunt: Straight Shooter Tutor</li>
<li>Taunt: Unleashed Rage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 38 new community-created Unusual effects
<ul>
<li>18 new effects for Unusual hats</li>
<li>20 new effects for Unusual taunts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant Summer 2024 Unusual effects instead of their normal Unusual effects during the Summer event. This does not include crates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/440/view/4156338670618090149" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update notes</a> include various improvements and fixes to the game overall too like some mysterious "Security and stability improvements".</p>

      <title>NVIDIA talk up their transition to open source GPU kernel modules</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in May 2022</a>, NVIDIA surprise released their open source Linux GPU kernel modules, and they've steadily been improving their open source support in general. Now they're talking up all the work to promote it a little more.</p>
<p>In a fresh developer <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-towards-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the NVIDIA team give a round-up of their recent work including how the open-source GPU kernel modules have expanded to include various new features like heterogeneous memory management (HMM) support, confidential computing and more.</p>
<p>They also mentioned again that the plan is currently to transition to fully using the open source GPU kernel modules for the 560 driver release series. Not all GPUs though, with older GPUs from the Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta architectures requiring the proprietary driver. This isn't anything new overall though, as this was previously mentioned to be happening <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-switching-to-open-kernel-modules-by-default-in-future-driver-update-for-turing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in May this year</a> but that was a comment in a forum post so this developer post is a bit more official on it.</p>
<p>Just nice to see more open source from NVIDIA. </p>
<p>In case you missed it before as well, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/nvidia-exploring-ways-to-support-an-upstream-kernel-mode-gpu-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA are exploring</a> ways to support an upstream kernel mode GPU driver.</p>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint adds full gamepad support and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little heist on the go perhaps? Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from Trese Brothers is steadily turning into a favourite turn-based tactics game and now with all the controller improvements it should feel a whole lot better on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>More about it: "Squad tactics heist RPG! Clever stealth, strategic combat, unique 23rd-century cyberpunk. Build your crew of hackers, mercs and malcontents wisely; their stories will become interwoven with your own. Use powerful cyberware, faction connections, and more to outsmart the odds &amp; determine your future."</p>
<p>The game has a Native Linux version, and a Steam Deck Playable rating that should eventually get bumped up to Verified as the Trese Brothers continue putting in effort to make it better on Deck.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/7025135705479590592" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> they noted some controls issues being solved on Steam Deck, and with the new default configuration you "should be very good to go with the Steam Deck". But, they're not using Steam Input on Deck specifically due to issues, but you can turn it back on in their settings. Elsewhere it should use Steam Input for the full controller support now.</p>

      <title>Blender 4.2 is another crazy-big release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From game devs to movies and all sorts, Blender is a truly incredible bit of free and open source tech and it has evolved a lot with Blender 4.2 out now.</p>
<p>One of the biggies from this release is the next generation of their rendering engine, EEVEE. They said it has been completely "rewritten from scratch to allow global illumination, displacement, better SSS, viewport motion blur, and so much more" so it's more feature-filled than ever. Cycles also got a huge upgrade to make renders look better and render even faster.</p>
<p>Need to extend Blender? Add-ons and Themes have been overhauled into a new Extensions system, allowing you to update them from inside Blender which sounds useful. Plus check out the <a href="https://extensions.blender.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Extensions site</a>.</p>
<p>Another fun one is Blender has become more portable than ever before. Now you can just take your entire config with you, as long as you have a folder named "portable" next to where you run Blender, it will load settings from there first.</p>
<p>For those who want a quick round-up:</p>

<p>And if you've got a little more time for the deep-dive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iwpBgtKilvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96ad3a25a294e30a116b8bacac77759b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iwpBgtKilvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Or just go and read the changes on the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blender website</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Blender user, let us know what you're up to with it in the comments, and what you think of the 4.2 release.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Worlds Part I is out now and drastically transforms the planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, here we go again. Hello Games just released another massive free update to No Man's Sky with Worlds Part I out now. No Man's Sky is rated Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This looks like probably one of the best updates yet, which I'm sure I've said before, but it's been true almost every time. Giving planets a really fresh feel some have big floating islands and you might even get a few waterfalls coming down from them which looks amazing. Flying around a planet is even more interesting with their new volumetric clouds with a mixture of wispy cirrus clouds and dark, rain-laden nimbus clouds. There's much more detailed shadows, high definition dynamic water with realistic wave formations and foam generation, lots of strange new creatures across various planets, full wind simulation, more dramatic storms, frozen worlds were given a big overhaul with ice-laden trees and glittering glacial rocks, new sky colours and the list just keeps on going and going.</p>
<p>What I've noted there is but the tip of the iceberg. There's walking buildings, aquatic landing jets, a new mech, more water colour variety, walker battles got more interesting, new base parts, richer atmospheric effects and then lots of random quality of life features.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also a brand new expedition that sees you go on an alien bug hunt. Oh, and you can finally rename your discoveries any time now too.</p>
<p>Main update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7-9Bf47yfs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e816234c32fcbacd5947f730f2ca2b37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7-9Bf47yfs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hello Games also mentioned how they refined input for touch screen interfaces with the Steam Deck and Switch being mentioned directly, along with fixing various input bugs there. Nice to see!</p>
<p>Check out their deep-dive video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XmU3_6BK-Ro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d55434ef33323ac9908e90290175a3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XmU3_6BK-Ro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Clearly, Hello Games are doing some fantastic work and it seems a fair bit of this is coming over from their world-generation for their upcoming game Light No Fire.

<p>Jackbox Games are soon to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Jackbox Megapicker</a>, which is basically a launcher that shows all their games so you won't need to keep switching between packs for all their different games.</p>
<p>As they explained: "The Jackbox Megapicker is your all-in-one solution for organizing, buying, and launching all of your Jackbox games. You no longer have to switch between Party Packs to start playing your favorite games. The Megapicker will give you an overview of the games that you own so you can launch them directly. View games you might be missing, and see news updates and ongoing sales all in one place. Filter your games by genre and create an account to store your preferences and see your game history."</p>
<p>It's releasing on July 29th, and the sweet treat to come with it, is that for 30 days following the release they will be giving away the 3-8 player game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/442070/Drawful_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drawful 2</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20762653071721216351gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20762653071721216351gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Usually I would moan about a launcher within a launcher, but in this case, when you think about how many game packs Jackbox Games now have it actually makes a good bit of sense to put it all together somehow.</p>

      <title>Fanatical&#39;s Bundle Bash has new game bundles every day this week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of a fresh set of games, you may want to hop over to Fanatical's Bundle Bash as they're putting out a new bundle every day this week.</p>
<p>The first was the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/summer-mystery-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Mystery Bundle</a>, allowing you to buy up to 20 mystery keys. While I don't particularly like the gambling aspect to it, generally it does give out some pretty good titles. This year there's some added bonuses too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes this year's bundle stand out is that with each purchase, you're automatically entered into our competition for a chance to win a Red Devil AMD Radeon™ RX 7800 XT 16GB GDDR6 PowerColor GPU worth over $500! But the excitement doesn't stop there. We are also including a chance to find AAA Game Packs within the bundle, featuring top-tier titles like Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR’S CUT, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, Dragon's Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition, Manor Lords, and No Rest for the Wicked. Will fortune favour you?</p>
<cite>Fanatical</cite></blockquote>
<p>The next is the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-rpg-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own RPG Bundle</a> starting from 3 for £4.99, and 8+ games end up as £1.25 a game so it's pretty good value overall. Especially when you look at just some of the titles you can pick that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortal Shell (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>The Ascent: Cyber Edition Bundle (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>For The King - Deluxe Edition (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable)</li>
<li>ATOM RPG Trudograd (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then from yesterday there's the new <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-empire-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own Empire Bundle</a> which offers up a similar deal to the above. In it you can get some sweet builders like:</p>
<ul>
<li>APICO (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>URBO (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>Coffee Shop Tycoon (<img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There will be another bundle release around 4PM BST today too.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and while it's not part of this bundle event, they do also have a bundle for GOG fans with the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own Bethesda Bundle - GOG Edition</a>.</p>

      <title>Enlisted from Gaijin and Darkflow returns to Steam and now free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After initially releasing on Steam as Enlisted: Reinforced back in March, it was quickly taken down but now it's back on Steam just as Enlisted. Players initially took issues with the fact that the Steam release was paid-only, while it was free direct from their website.</p>
<p>With the re-release, it still has Native Linux support and Valve gave it a Playable rating on Steam Deck (using the Native version too). While the developer said: "Enlisted also works on Steam Deck! We've adapted the game's interface and controls to ensure that the gaming experience on Steam's proprietary console is as comfortable as on other platforms where Enlisted is already available.".</p>
<p>So it seems they still have some work to do on small text and gamepad controls not being default which is holding it up from being fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="34TB7NnfI9I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4b99b106657f1b52ebce32533d43bb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/34TB7NnfI9I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Enlisted is quite unique when it comes to an online FPS, as you control a squad instead of a single person, with you being able to switch between them. It's pretty interesting but as usual for Gaijin there's a fair amount of in-app purchases just like War Thunder.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>TheForceEngine adds initial Dark Forces Remaster support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TheForceEngine is an open source modern "Jedi Engine" replacement supporting Dark Forces, mods, and in the future Outlaws. A new release version 1.10.000 just rolled out.</p>
<p>With this new version the initial support of Nightdive's Dark Forces Remaster has landed, however a bunch of its HD Assets are not supported <em>yet</em> but will be in future. TheForceEngine is also set up to now automatically detect the Dark Forces Remaster as a game data source.</p>
<p>Some new cheats were added including one hit kill, one hit death, 9 lives, the ability to render everything at full-brightness and a new cheat menu is also in. Plenty of bug fixes too, you can also now disable screen flashes, crouch toggle is now an option and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996793681721210225gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This release also came with a few Linux fixes too:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDL2 fixes on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed numerous clang/gcc warnings, Linux issues, 32-bit issues (though no 32-bit support on Windows is planned), and enabled GCC LTO (Link Time Optimizations).</li>
<li>Added workaround for GLEW on Wayland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up in a future release is also a full Level Editor, so it will be interesting to see if a community builds up around that. We could end up seeing some pretty fun stuff made for it. Nice to see another game engine reimplementation keep getting better!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine/releases/tag/v1.10.000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out The Immortal Lock, an impressive new Quake 1 mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more retro shooting goodness in your life? How about a little more from Quake 1? The Immortal Lock is a brand new pack from modder ComfyByTheFire that's well worth a look.</p>
<p>Before getting into it though, just note they do say you need an up to date install of <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vkQuake</a> (1.31.0+), which is a Vulkan Quake port based on QuakeSpasm.</p>
<p>Story: "You are Ranger, an operator of the UTJR stationed at a secret, multinational research facility in Finland. You are being deployed to investigate the disappearance of a survey team that went missing beyond the slipgate, cast into the farthest reaches of existence. Yet through the thin veil of reality, you find only a desolate plane of flesh and despair, and a dread voice that beckons your name."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yOZwx5Zn--U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a8fde97f4af8bb076cd3aa64512c3cba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yOZwx5Zn--U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what it includes: prepare for extremely challenging fights. The developer actually suggests you start on Easy mode. There will be plenty of "trick jumping, and a vast amount of large secret areas, but is difficulty scaled to accommodate everyone" and the map is "larger than an entire episode, if played in its entirety, and is best experienced in segments".</p>
<p>Go and <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/the-immortal-lock.371/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Try the demo for Pest Apocalypse a horde survival game where you deliver pizza in a van</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VANpire Survivors. I know, I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/pest-apocalypse-is-a-new-hilarious-survivor-like-game-with-a-death-mobile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already did that joke before</a>, but it's a good one. Pest Apocalypse is an upcoming chaotic horde survival game where you drive a vehicle to deliver pizza for hungry survivors.</p>
<p>The developers, Kikimora Games, have just recently put up a demo with Linux support (built with Godot Engine) so this might be a good one for you to give it a spin. Previously, Kikimora Games released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341410/Wizards_Way_Out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wizard's Way Out</a>, a small puzzle game about getting out of big trouble.</p>
<p>"Assemble a ragtag band of survivors, turbocharge your death-mobile, and rush straight into the thick of the action with a fearless grin. Your mission? To deliver steaming hot pizza to hungry customers, while fending off hordes of mutated pests!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YySZsiN_E_c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b085fe93c09c8aeb8a1404648f712620.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YySZsiN_E_c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hordes of disgusting pests to slaughter!</li>
<li>Personalize your vehicle and build your team of survivors, each with unique skills and abilities!</li>
<li>Use your wits and reflexes to outmaneuver and outrun the enemy!</li>
<li>Deliver scorching hot pizza, or risk the wrath of the chef!</li>
<li>Quick runs( &lt; 15 minutes) for maximum enjoyment!</li>
<li>Sweet 3D/2D pixel art graphics!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a lot of fun from my time in the demo, especially chaotic when you're able to get a bit further into it. Driving a vehicle certainly gives the survivor-like genre a different feel. I was already excited to see more from this and it looks like it may deliver.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://kikimora.itch.io/pest-apocalypse-demo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on itch.io</a>. And follow the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506810/Pest_Apocalypse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">game on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Infest is a deckbuilder where every pixel on the battlefield can burn, freeze, melt and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Taking some inspiration from the excellent Noita perhaps, Infest brings the mechanic of destroying all the pixels and puts it into a deckbuilder. Recently the developer announced Early Access for July 31st, and their testing showed it working great on the Steam Deck. It also appears to have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Here you build up a unique deck and deploy your cards to alter the environment, buff your status and unleash hell as you burn, freeze, corrode, shock and melt all the pixels on the screen during your battle. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customize your deck and upgrade cards along the way. Make sure it is well balanced to handle a variety of environmental effects. Can you melt ice? Can you stop mutant plants? Foresight is key.</p>
<p>Deal damage card by card, when your stack is exhausted the enemies get their chance to attack! They will create defensive barriers, throw damage cards at you, buff themselves and heal others! Anticipating their moves and playing the right card is key.</p>
<p>Choose your path through the alien universe. Each run is different so you can replay many times without getting bored. Besides the playable levels, you'll encounter shops, hospitals, and dozens of different bonus challenges. Picking the right path is key to survival.</p>

      <title>Amusingly British point &amp; click adventure Heir of the Dog now on Kickstarter (demo available)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tall Story Games are working on another quality British point and click adventure game, with Heir of the Dog now on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hardwidge/heir-of-the-dog-a-pixel-art-point-and-click-comedy-adventure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> with a demo available. Previously the developer released Lucy Dreaming, which was well received and had Linux support just like Heir of the Dog will.</p>
<p>More about it: "Replete with intricate, witty, and sardonic storytelling, Heir of the Dog, tells the story of bachelor and upper class twit, Cummerbund Bandersnatch. When visiting his uncle's laboratory, Bandersnatch discovers an experimental new formula guaranteeing a ‘good time’ for whoever drinks it. Seduced by the promises listed in his uncle's journal, he drinks the strange elixir and undergoes a monstrous transformation. Life will never be the same again."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sf4RvyPpPMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/547c7db1f87decf4251489c21cd5a099.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sf4RvyPpPMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have 28 days to hit £15,000, with £7,557 already pledged at time of writing. So clearly there's quite a bit of interest for the funding to flow in so rapidly. As a Brit myself, I of course was legally obliged to cover this. Kidding of course, but I do love seeing British humour in more games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hilarious dialogue and narrative.</li>
<li>Atmospheric and nostalgic pixel-art style.</li>
<li>Play as man, beast or dog to experience their extra senses and dirty habits.</li>
<li>Switch between night and day to solve puzzles and discover new abilities.</li>
<li>Choose between classic point &amp; click or character-based controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2431920/Heir_of_the_Dog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Also on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/heir_of_the_dog_demo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> but no Linux build there right now.</p>

      <title>Marathon 2 a classic FPS originally from Destiny developer Bungie now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the Aleph One developer community released the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bungies-classic-free-fps-marathon-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first in the trilogy of Marathon on Steam</a>, originally created by Bungie, they've now put up Classic Marathon 2.</p>
<p>As a reminder: the Marathon series was created by Bungie (Halo / Destiny) originally back in the 90s for Apple computers. Later Bungie opened up the source code of the Marathon 2 engine in 1999 with the game assets being made freeware in 2005. Now all three games are available via <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aleph One</a>, the open source continuation of Bungie's <cite>Marathon.</cite></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16183667261721127925gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16183667261721127925gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: Classic Marathon 2 running with Proton 9</em></p>
<p>About Classic Marathon 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fresh from your triumph on the colony ship Marathon, you are seized by the rogue AI Durandal to do his bidding in a distant part of the galaxy. Within the ruins of an ancient civilization, you must seek the remnants of a lost clan and uncover their long-buried secrets. Battle opponents ancient and terrible, with sophisticated weapons and devious strategies, all the while struggling to escape the alien nightmare…<br/>
<br/>
This classic 1995 Bungie™ FPS is now maintained by the fan community. Experience authentic game play using the original data files, with optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, just in case the original is <em>too</em> authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>For the Steam release of </cite>Classic Marathon 2, they are once again only providing macOS and Windows builds. So you can either play it via Proton on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398490/Classic_Marathon_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, use <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> for the Native Linux release from Steam or just download Aleph One directly.</p>
<p>The Steam version though does have the free XBLA Graphics Pack DLC, which is a "Replacement textures from the XBLA game Marathon: Durandal by Freeverse".</p>

      <title>SCAD is Twisted Metal meets Vampire Survivors and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a total sucker for over the top action, especially when you're tearing down hordes of enemies in whatever bullet hell / bullet heaven game comes along since Vampire Survivors kicked it all off. The next one I need in my life is SCAD.</p>
<p>More about it: "Adrenaline Fueled Chaos - Take a journey through a dangerous world where humanity is on the verge of extinction. Following a catastrophic event caused by a malicious corporation's experiments, the remnants of civilization survive in fortified junkyard enclaves. Take on missions. Engage in a never-ending battle with hordes of enemies across different environments."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>What's also interesting here is the developer, NAISU, usually make <em>hentai</em> games. And somehow, an aspiring game dev managed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1e3uwdp/comment/ldae1fi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convince them</a> to work on something else. I'm glad they did, because this looks <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>A first demo should be out in September, with Early Access in October.</p>

      <title>GameCube emulator Dolphin adds RetroAchievements support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another nice win for people who love hitting challenges, as <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a> support has now been added to Dolphin for GameCube. Currently not in the Wii side of the emulator, right now the focus is on getting it working well for GameCube emulation.</p>
<p>Showing the true power of open source, they were able to do this thanks to the PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/ps2-emulator-pcsx2-20-is-out-now-and-its-a-huge-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also recently had a major new release</a> that came with RetroAchievements support.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/15/unlocked-retroachievements-come-dolphin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the Dolphin team mentioned how "One of the things that helped was the PCSX2 implementation of RetroAchievements, which acted as a base for the developers who worked on the Dolphin version of the implementation. As well, their own achievement creation library had to be ported over to work with Dolphin's memory handling.". </p>
<p>Took them a good while to get it going, 18 months to get it all ready and due to how GameCube games work, it sounds like it was a lot of effort to ensure they actually work correctly.</p>

      <title>Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is a quality shoot &#39;em up throwback to Desert Strike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the Strike series (Desert/Jungle/Urban Strike) and Choplifter, Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is a lot of fun if you love fast-paced shoot 'em up action. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>As someone who grew up playing Desert Strike and later games, this one really spoke to me. Even if you don't have any nostalgia for the classics, it's still a well-made shoot 'em up full of twists and turns. Here you're not just flying any old helicopter, but the Megacopter, which appears to be somewhat alive and thirsty for blood.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rtM2r14BoNA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/119fe974539fd7ee2c79ff87ae6d932a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rtM2r14BoNA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here you go through a series of missions with increasing difficulty, as it sprinkles in various different types of enemies where your focus ends up split between ground and air attacks to counter and dodge. It needs some pretty fancy finger-work on the controls at times too, it can be quite challenging not to get destroyed. Some missions are a straight-up fight, others see you being sent to rescue people. There's even defence missions with enemy waves coming at you and boss fights too — it has a bit of everything.</p>
<p>A bit of a learning curve to the controls too. In a few ways it reminds me of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/incredible-top-down-shooter-brigador-gets-a-huge-free-enhancement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brigador</a> (also brilliant), with how you aim along a specific line that you move the crosshair inside. So you have to be aware of your position relative to the enemies, while they're firing at you, as you're also trying to line up your shots. It actually becomes pretty chaotic in the best possible way because you firing at both ground and air targets, with a separate button to target each. You'll spend a fair amount of time ducking and dodging in circles.</p>
<p>The story is a bit wild too, some crazy Reptoid people are trying to take over. Obviously it's your job to stop them. A job that perhaps they should have sent an army in for but they have you. Thankfully the Megacopter is powerful, with various different weapons and special ability combinations to unlock and pick your load-out for each mission. The story is just the right amount of ridiculous to make it feel not too far from an absured 80s action movie script. Great soundtrack to get the blood pumping too!</p>
<p>My only real issue is the graphical style. A bunch of it doesn't really fit together like the terrain and trees, when compared with the buildings and enemies all look a bit off and a bit out of place perhaps but once you get past that and sink some time into the game it really doesn't matter. Gameplay is king here, as they say and Megacopter is certainly a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It has full Native Linux and Steam Deck support. In fact, the developer <a href="https://x.com/megacoptergame/status/1810521250516586999" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> earlier this month that nearly 20% of the sales for it at that point were from Linux / Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Since release the developer has repeatedly improved all aspects of the game from player feedback too, including new ways to control the Megacopter and they continue to push out improvements even now.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a well-built shoot 'em up that you can't go wrong with.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app adds experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of fixing up various issues with Stardew Valley modding, the new Alpha of the cross-platform and open source Nexus Mods app introduces experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support.</p>
<p>For those just joining us, this is for the <em>new</em> Nexus Mods app that will <em>eventually</em> replace things like Vortex with full Linux support so you can mod on desktop Linux and Steam Deck much easier as I reported on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/nexus-mods-want-feedback-from-linux-steam-deck-users-on-their-new-cross-platform-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in July</a> and initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/nexus-mods-app-is-an-in-development-replacement-for-vortex-that-will-support-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in November last year</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1595693931721050152gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1595693931721050152gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods app on Linux</em></p>
<p>Version 0.5.3 of the app includes all these fixes on top of experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the "SMAPI is disabled"-diagnostic for multiple SMAPI installations (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1674" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1674</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed Loadout disappearing when applying (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1737</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed un-managing a game removing all Loadouts instead of just the ones for the current game (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1738" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1738</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed sorting in the Mod Library and the "Completed Downloads"-section (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1690" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1690</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed SVGs not loading and rendering properly in the markdown viewer (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1661" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1661</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed SVGs throughout the App (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1622" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1622</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1681" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1681</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed not disposing services on close correctly (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1679" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1679</a>).</li>
<li>Windows: Fixed log file creation failing due to illegal character in path (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1728</a>). Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/ZeeWanderer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@ZeeWanderer</a>!</li>
<li>Linux: Fixed protocol registration (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1691" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1691</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1689</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1683" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1683</a>).</li>
<li>Linux: Upgraded <a href="https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameFinder</a> to fix an issue with not being able to find Steam installed as a Flatpak or Snap (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1720</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a few other assorted improvements behind the scenes on this too.</p>
<p>I really cannot tell you how excited I am to see this app expand. Modding support on Linux has traditionally been a bit messy, and with a proper cross-platform Nexus Mods app, things will become so much easier.</p>
<p>Just to note: it <strong>didn't</strong> initially launch for me, I had to remove the configs from the previous version to get this latest to work. The bug was <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/1765" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> but given it's in Alpha, such breakages are to be expected and they don't plan to support migrations yet. So keep that in mind. If you also tried the previous version, you can find the configs in "/.local/share/NexusMods.App".</p>
<p>For Linux / Steam Deck, download the "NexusMods.App.x86_64.AppImage" from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.5.3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.10 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 6.10 and with it, plenty of new hardware support and improvements to existing hardware. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Announcing the release Torvalds <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/7/14/250" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the final week was perhaps not quote as quiet as the preceding ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to warrant an extra rc. And much of the noise this last week was bcachefs again (with netfs a close second), so it was all pretty compartmentalized.</p>
<p>In fact, about a third of the patch for the last week was filesystem-related (there were also some btrfs latency fixes and other noise), which is unusual, but none of it looks particularly scary.</p>
<p>Another third was drivers, and the rest is "random".</p>
<p>Anyway, this obviously means that the merge window for 6.11 opens up tomorrow. Let's see how that goes, with much of Europe probably making ready for summer vacation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Just some cherry-picked items that made it into Linux kernel 6.10 below.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Gaming Related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck IMU support, plus the kernel now accounts for both versions of the Steam Deck (LCD / OLED).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/proposed-windows-nt-sync-driver-brings-big-wine-proton-performance-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NTSYNC driver </a>was merged to hopefully improve Wine / Proton game performance, but not enabled yet.</li>
<li>Improvements to Xbox Elite 2 controller back paddle buttons over Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Added support for the Machenike G5 Pro Controller.</li>
<li>Improved support for some ROG Ally buttons.</li>
<li>Added support for the ASUS ROG RAIKIRI PRO.</li>
<li>New support for GameForce Chi retro handheld.</li>
<li>Improved Aya Neo KUN support.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other picks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panthor driver for Arm Mali Valhall GPUs landed.</li>
<li>More work on bringing up support for the upcoming Intel Battlemage.</li>
<li>A new mseal() syscall for the Linux kernel that "protects the VMAs of a given virtual memory range against modifications", currently Google Chrome plans to hook into it.</li>
<li>Lots of RISC-V support improvements.</li>
<li>More WiFi 7 hardware support.</li>
<li>Lots of new Arm device support across various small boards like the ArmSom Sige7, Forlinx FET3588-C and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's thousands of changes of course that I'm not going to go over, those are just a few bits that jumped out that I thought you might want to know. If I missed anything important and gaming related, be sure to send in a tip.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's your chance to play a platform fighter that's a bit different, and help shape its development with Counterpick Labs now in Early Access from developer UrbanMotmot.</p>
<p>No set characters or super-heroes here, instead you build your perfect fighter by mixing and matching various weapons, some of which are quite odd. There's over 200 load-out combinations to try, so a little something for everyone.</p>
<p>The gameplay involved you trying to knock your opponents off-stage to secure a win. With the ability to play locally or online (with rollback netcode). It's free to play, with no pay-to-win mechanics involved. It will remain free to play when it's finished too. You can support development by buying their bananas micro-transactions on Steam for some cosmetics.</p>

      <title>Check out Quantum Witch, a platformer meets point and click choose your adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer NikkiJay recently revealed Quantum Witch, a rather quirky sounding mix of game genres that blends a platformer with a sort-of choose your adventure style.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned it will have Native Linux support and Steam Deck support, with them working as a solo developer getting it ready to release next June.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's a straightforwardly lovely day in Hus.</p>
<p>It's always a lovely day in Hus. That's not suspicious at all! The bovey is grazing in the field, the faer are roaming around town causing chaos, the shadies are out preaching (they're not a cult!), and a giant stone portal to another dimension has appeared in the woods.</p>
<p>I hope nothing goes hideously wrong and results in an adventure."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rsWw8ZABdVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34c0af9c41f552f5b20484436aabb8b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rsWw8ZABdVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>A little more about it:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Narrative and choice driven platform adventure. Imagine choose your own adventure meets point and click meets platformer. Yes, you've got it! It's that.</li>
<li>Hand crafted retro resolution pixel art in a cute style that definitely doesn't unexpectedly turn creepy.</li>
<li>Not a cult.</li>
<li>Choices matter. Convince a character to wear something? They'll wear it for the rest of the game. Save a character? They'll be there as part of your story.</li>
<li>Very, very gay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.1.1 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters. The team is excited to present the new version of the fheroes2 engine - 1.1.1 for Heroes of Might and Magic II after more than a month of hard work.<br/>
This release was mainly focused on polishing the <strong>Editor</strong>, but not only.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor got support for <strong>Rumors</strong>, <strong>Daily Events</strong> and <strong>special Victory and Loss conditions</strong>. These were missing features that are present in the original game. However, as promised we added them as quickly as possible after the new Editor was launched. The team used different design of dialogs in comparison to the original Editor to make it more user-friendly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9997418791721035154gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9997418791721035154gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13645266861721035170gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13645266861721035170gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Besides fixing several issues in the Editor and adding missing parts we also made multiple improvements. First of all, the team redesigned the <strong>hero selection window</strong> in the Editor. No more scrolling through similar icons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070103501721035224gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12070103501721035224gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Secondly, we started adding new content to the game. As a start, the team added a missing part of the Sphinx and a new variation of the adventure map Cave object.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1107085551721035247gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1107085551721035247gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A brand new feature now available in the Editor is the ability to <strong>restrict the construction</strong> of any building in towns and castles. This gives a lot of flexibility for map makers to design maps with unique gameplay conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5423572931721035280gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5423572931721035280gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <strong>AI</strong> was updated as well. We reworked all bonuses the AI had in the past and reduced them significantly to have a fair play for AI. This aligns with our goals: we want difficulty level affect only AI behaviour without giving it any perks.<br/>
Additionally, we fixed few places in AI logic.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, the team updated multiple translations, improved various UI elements and closed <strong>over 40 issues</strong> since the previous release.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!</p>

      <title>RPG Maker MV / MZ for Linux tool now supports TyranoBuilder, RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's in need of a better name, the RPG Maker MV / MZ for Linux tool had a new release recently that expanded the support for running games on Linux from TyranoBuilder, and RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace.</p>
<p>Initially covered here on GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/this-open-source-project-runs-rpg-maker-mv-mz-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in early May</a>, it's a collection of scripts and tools bundled together to allow you to run various games natively on Linux. Initially only for games built with RPG Maker MV / MZ, the developer released version 1.0.9 on July 1st adding support for TyranoScript/TyranoBuilder engine V4 and V5, plus now also RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace games via the <a href="https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mkxp-z</a> linux library.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned how it can now also be used as a compatibility tool in Steam, so you can run games from Steam using it like you would with Proton or Luxtorpeda.</p>
<p>Picking a completely random game, I tested it with the demo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2455920/Mimic_Logic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mimic Logic</a> using it as the compatibility tool in Steam and it runs perfectly. Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/Engine/RPGMaker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> having an RPGMaker Engine tag.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2770381201720898467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2770381201720898467gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5797098391720898467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5797098391720898467gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other features the developer listed on the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sharp increase in fps (from 2 to 4 times more compared to Wine, can be viewed by pressing the F2 key).</li>
<li>Updating Pixi 5 libraries for RPG Maker MV games (that's supposed to increase performance).</li>
<li>Downloading and selecting any version of NWJS (using the command line).</li>
<li>Easily installable SDK version of NWJS with one click in the gui, or via cli.</li>
<li>Starting a game with the Japanese locale option.</li>
<li>Launching a game using a command line.</li>
<li>Showing the NWJS, Nodejs, Chromium versions of your downloaded game.</li>
<li>Installing the Text hooker plug-in that copies the game's dialogs automatically to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Can be used as compatibility tool in steam for Windows games.</li>
<li>The Native support of 4 architectures: x86-64, i386, armhf, arm64</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So in future if you see any games you wish to play on Linux that were made with one of the RPG Maker game engines or TyranoBuilder, perhaps this tool might end up as one of the best ways for compatibility and performance.</p>
<p>A total no-fuss experience too. Download the release package from <a href="http://github.com/bakustarver/rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a>, run the included installer, and it adds it to Steam's Compatibility menu for you.</p>

      <title>PS2 Emulator PCSX2 2.0 is out now and it&#39;s a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PCSX2 is a popular open source emulation for the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2) and PCSX2 version 2.0 is now officially available with a great many changes and improvements.</p>
<p>There's so many changes in fact, that it's pretty difficult to give you a summary of what's new. Quite literally every part of the emulator has been improved.</p>
<p>For starters they've moved away from wxWidgets for the interface to the much more modern and cross-platform Qt. The developers said Qt brings with it a "slick appearance, more efficient UI backend, and provided the perfect opportunity to redo all our menus and widgets" with the addition of themes to personalise it to your liking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754074481720895468gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11754074481720895468gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20725618001720895469gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20725618001720895469gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Along with Qt also comes SDL2 now integrated, which gives vast improvements to controller mapping and works across different platforms. Thanks to that PCSX2 now has automatic controller mapping, so you're only a few button clicks away from being set up with your favourite gamepads.</p>
<p>Plugins were removed, but they've now added in Automatic Game Fixes. Using their own database of all the games, they ship pre-configured fixes to ensure games will run smoothly so you shouldn't need to go in and change various settings for different games. However, the UI also now has a section for per-game settings for any personalized changes and tweaks you do wish to make.</p>
<p>The list just keeps going on and on. PCSX2 even has its own Big Picture Mode now too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729967531720895879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729967531720895879gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also now support for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a>!</p>
<p>So many other additions like Vulkan API support, an upgraded patches system, various performance improvements, FFMPEG for video capture support, improved game compatibility, sound system improvements and much more.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lengthy blog post</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>RPG Maker / Pixel Game Maker devs move to Godot for Action Game Maker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly an interesting one. Gotcha Gotcha Games known for the RPG Maker series and Pixel Game Maker have announced Action Game Maker and it's being made with the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Announced on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987180/ACTION_GAME_MAKER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam page</a>, they said it's "designed to be the successor to Pixel Game Maker MV", which brought over their visual scripting inspired by the RPG Maker series but for a wider range of 2D action games. Their current code base was making things difficult to expand, with a lot of limitations and so they "decided that it is in the best long-term interests of our users to build a brand new Maker title, created from the ground up with a new framework" and that's where Action Game Maker comes in.</p>
<p>Much like their previous RPG Makers and Pixel Game Maker, it will be a no-code game creation tool that "builds on the node-based visual scripting system" from Pixel Game Maker MV so you don't need to know line-by-line written programming. And since they're building it on Godot, it's going to have a bunch of advanced features for those who want it, as noted on the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advanced Engine Technology With Godot Engine!</strong></p>
Take advantage of the excellent 2D functionality provided by Godot Engine, the popular open source engine powering ACTION GAME MAKER!
<ul>
<li>UI design based on the existing Godot UI</li>
<li>Support for GDScript is provided for those who want to move beyond visual scripting.</li>
<li>A complete 2D pipeline</li>
<li>Tile Map Editor with auto-tile function</li>
<li>Supports both sprite and 2D bone animation systems</li>
<li>Access to Godot's rich particle and shader systems as well as support for dynamic lighting and shadows, enabling a full suite of graphics features!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this time we might even see a proper Linux version for more game development to be done on Linux. Or at the very least, properly support Linux builds of game exports from it.</p>
